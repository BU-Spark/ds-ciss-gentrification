301,1936864259,"o N n n H ii EJ M ID] N 1 EY STEVEN PEARL8TEIN The road to growth in Washington is out of the exurbs PEARLSTEIN FROM Gl areas in the eastern quadrants of the District and some of the region’s older, closer*in suburbs. It’s not just smart-growth planners and anti-sprawl activists who think so; most developers I’ve spoken with in recent weeks agree. The models for the future, they say, can be found in Pentagon City rather than Dale City, along the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor rather than the far reaches of the Dulles corridor, in the NOMA area near Union Station and the downtowns of Bethesda and Silver Spring. The pressure of development now points inward toward the Capitol, not outward toward Germantown, Gainesville, Waldorf and Laurel. Consider, for example, Crystal City?, with its proximity to Reagan National Airport, spectacular views of the Potomac and the national monuments, its Metro stop and easy access to highways leading in all directions. If ever there was an ideal location for prime office and hotel space and high-end condos with all the amenities, this is it. And yet for years, legions of GS-13s and midlevel midlevel defense contractors toiled in its sterile office buildings and criss-crossed its warren of underground malls before driving home on streets devoid of interesting retail stores, restaurants or pedestrian life. It took the heavy hand of the Pentagon and its base closure commission to do what the market should have, forcing a redevelopment aimed at higherpaving, higherpaving, private-sector tenants. The rationalization of land use in the region is now? being driven bv fundamental shifts in the economics of housing and commercial development. The news that Bloomingdale’s will close its White Flint store says less about the future of the department store or Rockville Pike than about enclosed malls. Shoppers no longer prefer them, retailers are abandoning them and developers are scrambling to tear them down or — as is the case of White Flint - turn them into suburban town centers. Even in a rejuvenated Georgetown, the once-elegant Georgetown Park mall sits mostly empty. The same fate is in store for the suburban office park that, not so many years ago, was the bread and butter of the commercial real estate business in Washington. Workers no longer prefer to work in them, companies no longer want to occupy them, banks no longer will finance them, real estate investment trusts no longer w?ant to own them and planning boards have become reluctant to approve them.

Changes in tastes are also conspiring with changing demographics to alter the economics of housing developments, particularly in the outer suburbs. Across the region, a generation of baby boomers is getting ready to sell three-bedroom suburban colonials to Gen Xers who either don’t w?ant them or can’t afford them. Add to that a wave of foreclosures and excess inventory left over from a speculative housing boom that has driven home prices in many submarkets to levels below the cost of new construction. For exurban developers, the implication is pretty clear: The raw? land they’re holding isn’t worth much and in any case, and there’s not much point trying to build on it until the excess inventory is worked off. Perhaps that is why developments that were started during the boom but were never finished are selling at 35 cents on every dollar invested in land, roads, street lights, sewer and water lines and half-finished golf courses. Even when the market clears, exurban development is likely to focus on low-cost starter homes. All that contrasts sharply with w?hat is going on in the District and inner suburbs, where prices have held steady and a construction boom is under way for new and remodeled townhouses and apartments. Despite the absence of bank lending, speculative condo developments have even begun to spring up in the hotter neighborhoods, almost all of them equity financed. This market is driven by singles, young-marrieds and emptynesters, emptynesters, plus a growing number of families with children, all looking for a more urban, less cardependent cardependent lifestyle. Accommodating this new demand, and these new economics, won’t be easy. Whereas exurban development was a matter of assembling a few large tracts of farmland or sparsely settled countryside, redevelopment of existing neighborhoods requires dealing with scores of owners of small parcels who may not want to sell, or like things the way they are and will use the political process to keep them that way. Traditionally, one advantage of the “infill” development is that it can leverage existing infrastructure — roads, Metro, street lights, water, sewer, parks — without the need for new investment. But today, adding significant density in many instances may require expanding the capacity of that infrastructure, which can get pretty expensive and generate plenty of community opposition. In those big exurban projects of the past, the developers were required to pay for most of the new infrastructure, including schools in some instances. But if increasing density of housing or commercial use requires the widening of Route 1 or putting a light-rail line down Columbia Pike, there is no one developer w?ho can be required to foot the bill. Whatever is done must be a public expense agreed to by the voters and added to the tax bills of all landowners in the city, the county or the special taxing district. That alone can explain why development never happened. It is easy to point now to the fabulous success of the RosslynBallston RosslynBallston corridor, or of downtown Bethesda and Silver Spring, but the reality is that it took more than a decade of determined effort by planning, zoning and elected officials before they overcame myriad practical and political obstacles. Prince George’s County offers the greatest gap between the potential for development and redevelopment in the inner ring and market realities. High crime rates, inferior schools, rampant corruption and sheer ineptitude on the part of local officials have scared away many developers. Racism has been a factor as well. At this point, however, what has long been considered a Prince George’s problem is now a regional problem: If the Washington area is to grow, a lot of that growth is going to have to happen in Prince George’s. Given the strength of the market resistance so far, only the federal government has the clout to jump-start that development process. A study by the University of Maryland found that although the county accounts for a third of the land in the region and a fifth of the population, only 4 percent of the government’s leased office space is within its borders — and that despite some of the region’s lowest rents and land values. Although 26 percent of the region’s federal workers live in the county, less than 8 percent of them work there. The General Services Administration made a knuckleheaded knuckleheaded decision last year when it extended a big lease for 3,000 federal workers at a building in Montgomery County rather than take up an offer to relocate the work to New Carrollton, Largo or Hyattsville, all with Metro stops nearby. The GSA cited lower cost as the key factor, reflecting a sizable subsidy that Montgomery County taxpayers provided to keep the jobs. That kind of bidding war among local jurisdictions is just plain stupid, whether it is for Northrop’s headquarters or a GSA lease. If GSA Regional Administrator Robert Peck is to be taken seriously on his promise to locate federal employment in Prince George’s, he should be pressured to issue a rule discounting the effect of local subsidies in evaluating competing lease proposals. On a level playing field. Prince George’s ought to win most of those competitions hands down. Even that, however, probably won’t be enough. Given the endemic corruption and favoritism surrounding development in Prince George’s, it also will be necessary for Maryland to step in and create a Capital Region Redevelopment Authority whose director and board majority are appointed by the governor. Such an authority would need to have the power to borrow money, buy and assemble land (by taking if necessary), override local zoning in extraordinary circumstances, and provide an open and fair mechanism for private developers to compete for rights at Metro stops, highway exits and other prime locations. Because of the potential to raise land values and generate additional revenue for the state and its counties, such an authority could easily be selffinancing. selffinancing. Virginia and the District probably don’t need such heavyhanded heavyhanded intervention, but they should consider the possibility of special taxing and redevelopment districts, such as the one used to finance the extension of Metro to Dulles International Airport. It is reasonable to ask landowners who will realize windfalls from infrastructure to help pay for these public investments, and in the current political environment it is folly to think that other taxpayers will agree to do so. There are natural limits to how much a metropolitan region can expand its economy and its population by expanding its geographic footprint, and Washington is probably getting pretty close to them. The evidence can be found in the horrible commutes, in the divergent trends in land values at the core and at the periphery, and in the extraordinary cost of extending Metrorail to Loudoun County. Older cities such as New York, Boston, San Francisco and Chicago reached similar limits a generation ago, and it is no coincidence that their recent economic revival has been accompanied by the gentrification of urban neighborhoods and the redevelopment of closer-in suburbs. Changes in lifestyles and market pressures are pushing the Washington region in a similar direction. Still missing, however, is the political and business leadership needed to accommodate, accelerate and manage that process. More on that next week.

I’ll include as many as I can in the series? final installment Iqter this month. The markets don t care how you vote u gfjy, What Mr. Ivltholtz Market is 0N saying about INVESTING the election: What does this candidate or that mean for the stock market returns? Will an incumbent victory bode well or poorly? Are stock prices telling voters which candidate will be friendlier to future market returns? In a word, no. Markets do not rally or sell off because one candidate or the other is more likely to win. This might strike some as a bit radical, but here it is: Markets don’t give a flying fig about any of this nonsense. First, consider the classic “causation/correlation error” — one that pundits make all the time. This occurs when two factors happen at similar times, and an assumption is made that one is causing the other. Correlation errors confuse cause and effect. Typically, a more significant but overlooked factor is driving the outcome. Here is a classic example: “The incumbent’s poll numbers are rising, and the S?P 500 likes it. It has been rallying in response.” Not exactly. There is a third explanation, and understanding this requires thinking about what is common to both incumbent polls and stock markets. Instead of assuming that one is causing the other, we need to look for broader forces that are driving both elements. Most of the time when an incumbent is doing well in the polls, it is because the economy is doing well enough (or improving fast enough) that it is generating solid corporate earnings, strong hiring and positive consumer spending. That not only drives stocks and markets higher, but also makes voters feel economically secure. This works to the advantage of the sitting president. Note that the opposite is also true: Markets do not do poorly because the challenger is polling well; rather, the conditions that help a presidential challenger obtain victory — weak job availability, unhappiness with the economic conditions, desire for change — are negatives for earnings and the markets. Don’t expect to hear this straightforward reasoning from the punditry. During the silly season, politicos and cranks push all manner of sophistry and ignorance onto an unsuspecting public. We’ve seen it in the editorial pages, from guests on my pal Larry Kudlow’s show, and all over the intertubes. Too many folks blame every twitch of the market as a reaction to the politician they like or dislike the most. The shorter-term swings are especially nonsense. Let’s consider what is driving day-to-day stock prices: It’s not expectations about changing capital gains taxes or broad shifts in healthcare healthcare spending — issues that arguably can be gamechangers gamechangers in elections. Rather, large hedge funds and high-frequency traders are the biggest participants short-term. The machinedriven machinedriven mathematical traders have no interest in politics; their stock purchases are held for milliseconds, and their buying is driven by quantitative formulas that have nothing to do with any candidate. Hedge-fund managers certainly are not making bets dependent on the outcome of elections 10 months hence. They are more concerned with monthly, weekly and even daily performance. The technical factors driving what they do are far removed from whatever is happening on the campaign trail. These simple facts never seem to get in the way of the op-ed writers at various journals who seem to favor arguments along these lines: “Worries about possible policy changes are weighing on Just about this time every campaign cycle, the pundits get all excited about markets ahead of the year’s presidential elections. Candidate X’s rise in the polls is a risk that is giving the stock market jitters. Stock prices are wobbling, all leading to uncertainty. (And the markets hate uncertainty.)” This analysis — to use the word loosely — is misleading and flawed. Investors should avoid misconstruing information from polling and extrapolating it toward markets. Here are some other arguments to watch out for: Misplaced credit and blame: Presidential blame and credit for the markets is greatly exaggerated. The U.S. chief executives get far more credit than they deserve for good markets, economies and business cycles. They also get more blame when the economy is weak than is reasonable or fair. This is true regardless of which party wins the White House, or where the economy is in its cycle. The Obama bull market: Perhaps you don’t buy my arguments. Then you must obviously be rooting for an incumbent victory. Why is it that? Consider how the markets did under George W. Bush, the most recent “probusiness “probusiness president.” Then imagine how markets probably reacted to the antibusiness antibusiness socialist from Kenya. I have some disappointing news those of you who believe in such utter silliness: The S?P started at 850 the day Obama was sworn in; last week it hit 1292 — a better than 50 percent gain over three years. (If that’s antimarket, antimarket, I’ll have some more, please.) In 2001, when Bush was sworn in, the S?P stood at 1343. He left at 850 - a decline of about 37 percent. If you buy into the foolishness that presidents drive markets, than given his giant stock gains. Obama is your guy. Anthropomorphizing markets: Politicos make another analytical error in the language they use: Markets “prefer” one candidate over another; polls are validated by short-term rallies; a disliked candidate’s latest stump speech is what drove the last sell-off. It is a trick used to frame issues, and it is disingenuous at best. Indeed, with these silly claims, pundits manage to combine all of the analytical errors discussed above. Perhaps it helps to think of markets as future discounting mechanisms. Whenever an economy is slowing, markets price in the possibility of worse profits and sales. (My experience is this occurs three to sue months in advance.) Markets are imperfect, subject to excesses of crowd behavior, but they get the big picture correct eventually. When the economy is improving, you will see that reflected in improving stock prices, often in advance of the stronger economic data. Weak job creation and slow sales both affect equity prices, the electorate and the incumbent party’s election fortunes. When folks are content with the status quo and feel secure in their financial futures, they vote for more of the same; when they are not, they vote for change. Thus, the cause is the weakening economy and its discontents thereto. The effect is the rise of candidates claiming to be change agents — and the fall of those representing the status quo. The underlying conditions that lead to strong equity’ markets - robust growth, job creation, brisk consumer spending, income gains, tame inflation, etc. - also work to aid the incumbent. It is not that markets like incumbents, it is that both markets and incumbents do better when the overall economy is doing well. Putting the day-to-day noise into the larger context of quai lers and years will help make you a better, smarter investor. Ritholtz is chief executive of FusionlQ, a quantitative research firm.

919,1936887340,"THE REGION THE DISTRICT Brookings study explores walkabilily of neighborhoods Wealthy, educated populations found in highly rated areas by Ashley Halsey III You’d like a market within walking distance? A choice of restaurants, a dry cleaner, a hardware store and some interesting interesting shops in the blocks near your house? To find that urban nirvana in Washington, be ready to spend some serious cash. A new Brookings study puts the city’s neighborhoods under a microscope and finds that the most walkable parts of town, where amenities are readily available, are those where the most educated and best-paid people live. By contrast, in the neighborhoods neighborhoods Brookings deemed least walkable, average household income income is about half as much and residents are more than twice as likely to be unemployed. Georgetown rates at the top of the walkability scale. The New York Avenue corridor sits at the bottom. The Brookings study, which relies on a complex formula to calculate walkability, underscores underscores a regional and national trend that has been evident in other studies and reports. For many Americans who have the financial luxury of living where they wish, the suburbia that beckoned their parents has lost some of its allure. The District, District, like many U S. cities, grew in the first decade of this century, adding about 30,000 newcomers. newcomers. As the downside of suburban living — longer daily commutes on congested highways — began to grow, so did the desire of people to repopulate places closer closer to the job, where driving isn’t a daily requisite. During the decade when the District grew by 30,000, the number of cars registered in the city remained flat. More than a quarter of adult city residents don’t own a car. federal data show.

While in some cases that has meant gentrification gentrification of older urban neighborhoods, neighborhoods, in others it has resulted in development of new communities communities built around the concept of walkability: National Harbor in Prince George’s. Annapolis Town Centre at Parole. King Farm Village Village Center in Montgomery and the Carlyle District in Alexandria. Alexandria. “Planners and engineers are seeing and acting on the desire for walkable, livable communities,? communities,? Schwartz said. “This is a major regional traffic solution.” A key finding of the Brookings report is that the more walkable a neighborhood is, the higher the value of its office and retail space, and the more income from residential rentals and sales. National Harbor rivaled Georgetown in walkability in the Brookings report, earning the highest ranking. Joining New York Avenue at the other end of the walkability spectrum were the Naylor Road neighborhood in Southwest Washington and Landover Road in Prince George’s. There was a stark economic difference between those communities communities the report defined as offering the best amenities within within walking distance and those that had the fewest. The average household income in the highest-ranked highest-ranked neighborhoods was $103,000. more than $20,000 above the regional average. In the neighborhoods judged least walkable it was $53,000, or $28,000 below- the regional average. average. In top-ranked neighborhoods, nearly 28 percent of residents had a graduate degree. In the lowest-ranked areas, 11 percent had one, and the largest proportion proportion of residents — 22 percent — ended their education w?ith a high school diploma. halseyaij?washpost. com Novelist w ith  a. roots awaits rHuase of’Lawloss’ BONDURANT FROM Bl mother was a Fairfax schoolteacher. schoolteacher. He attended Washington Mill Elementary School, Whitman Whitman Intermediate School and Mount Vernon High, from w?hich he graduated in 1989. Bondurant does not have fond memories of life at Mount Vernon Vernon High in the 1980s, where he said teachers were more concerned concerned with maintaining order than teaching. But he loved reading, reading, and he brought books to read under the desk. He wrote a little poetry, anchored a dominant swim team and worked as photo editor of the high school yearbook. yearbook. It wasn’t until he reached JMU, and encountered a bit more academic rigor, that he realized there might be something to this literature stuff. Mark Facknitz, a professor w’hom Bondurant acknowledged acknowledged in his recent book, ?taught me ways of looking at books in a serious w r ay.? He immersed immersed himself in Edgar Allan Poe for a long stretch, and Poe’s dark influence is evident in his writing. Still not a great student, he graduated and kicked around the country? for a time, dabbled in journalism briefly and realized that he loved college. He was accepted into a master’s program in English at JMU, and “I began comprehending for the first time,? he said. Bondurant still didn’t see writing writing as a vocation. Writers were “like somebody from another planet,” he said. But with encouragement encouragement from professors such as Facknitz. ?I started to consider the possibility.” After receiving his master’s, he w?as accepted into a highly regarded regarded doctoral creative-wiiting program at Florida State University?. University?. He figured that if he couldn’t make it as a writer, he’d have a doctorate and could teach. “I spent the first couple years there flailing around,? Bondurant said. “These people were all in. I thought, ‘I want to be like that.’ ’’ He wrote short stories, piled up the rejections and learned how to craft narratives and characters. characters. One of his short stories eventually was published, a young agent recruited him and soon he began working on something something longer. After Florida State, he spent John Kelly?s Washington St AO BONDURANT Matt Bondurant wrote “The Wettest County in the World ” which is based on his family’s exploits in the bootlegging business in southwestern Virginia. The story is also told in the movie “Lawless.” some time as a steward at the British Museum in London, which provided the inspiration for his first novel, “The Third TYanslation,? published by Hyperion Hyperion in 2005. By then, he was teaching freshman composition classes at George Mason and working on “The Wettest County,” County,” which was published by Scribner Scribner in 2008. “Bondurant is a nimble writer, especially when it comes to depicting depicting gore and guts,” Louisa Thomas wrote in the New York Times Book Review. “His descriptions descriptions of the warped and wounded . . can leave a reader queasy, but the liveliness of his writing makes it hard for even the most lily-livered to look away.” The book focuses on Jack, Forrest and Howard Bondurant, as well as the moonshine culture of Franklin County during and after Prohibition.

963,1936955999,"the Root I)(] Clinton Yates At first sight, you might call it the Mount Rushmore of HalfSmokes. HalfSmokes. Or maybe the Four Horseman of the Chili-pocalypse. Personally, I’ll go with the Ben’s Wall of Fame. Whatever you choose to call the new mural that adorns the outside wall of the District’s iconic Ben’s Chili Bowl, you have to admit: It’s beautiful. Portraits of Chuck Brown, Bill Cosby, President Obama and Donnie Simpson now serve as greeters if you find yourself in one of the lines that often snake around the building. The mural is on the east side of the alley that separates the restaurant from the I .incoln Theatre and was nearly a year in the making. “It’s looking great. I was worried at first, to be quite honest, because it’s a wall,” creator Aniekan Udofia, 36, said as he put the finishing touches on a piece that features four men who have supported the neighborhood stalwart. “It’s not a flat surface like a canvas or a piece of paper,” Udofia said. The mural is a tremendous example of what happens when government and nonprofit groups work together. MuralsDC, the city-funded program that provides legal avenues for turning donated wall space into graffiti-inspired works of art, teamed with Eric B. Ricks after the success they had last year with ?Ben Ali’s Alchemy,” a mural on the side of Ben’s Next Door, the sister restaurant to the original. That piece represents the social change since Ali opened the eatery in 1P58. It planted the seed for the new r mural. Nancee Lyons of the D C. Department of Public Works said organic growth was vital to the recent project. “Our consultant is Words, Beats and Life, a nonprofit organization that works with youth. They have relationships with people— It just becomes a [ matter] of, ‘Hey, maybe we can work together,’ ” she said. “We like to do areas that we know receive a lot of graffiti. .

Don’t let the last days of summer go by without soaking up some fun over Labor Day weekend. Here are some activities for cocktail lovers, music aficionados, museumgoers and everyone in between. Friday TVy some of the W Hotel’s summer cocktails from its POV bar’s seasonal menu. Lounge on the D.C. hotel’s rooftop with a spicy Luchador Rosa cocktail made with silver tequila, raspberries and “heilfire” bitters or a champagne-and-gin cocktail called the French Reception.

Where life’s a beach ... If none of these outings tickles your fancy and you still haven’t gotten your summer beach fix, slip out of town to nearby Chesapeake Beach. There is a 1980s, when Cool ?Disco” Dan, the legendary? graffiti artist, sprayed his tag across the District, graffiti has largely lived as a subculture in the shadows. Finally, people have let it out into the open as a socially acceptable art of letters. It’s incredibly refreshing to see generations coming together and embracing one another?s different expressive forms to beautify the city and educate people. But at first, it wasn’t easy. When D.C. Council member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) created MuralsDC in 3007, Dominic Painter, who served as a site manager for the Ben’s project, remembers the friction. “The older guard was a bit taken aback at first,” Painter said. “But since 2008, when we did our first official program, everyone’s been won over and understands that this is a specific mission that is worth upholding.” Public art is vital to any city. Just ask Charles Jean-Pierre, the artist behind the all-acrylic Chuck Brown mural at Sweet Mango in Petworth, who’s been helping Udofia this week. “Street art is definitely an underrated form of art. usually looked down upon. But it’s hard to look down upon street art when you see big murals like this,” Jean-Pierre said. “How many people actually go into galleries and get to share that experience?? he added. “Anybody that walks down the street, whether they’re old, young, rich, poor — everybody can enjoy this mural and find something where they connect with it.’’ There may be more visible murals in the city, but the location of this one is paramount: Ben’s is arguably the important landmark that represents the District’s native culture. Over the past 10 years, it has been ground zero as a window into the gentrification of the city. But long before Obama made an appearance with then-Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, the neighborhood neighborhood spot was serving people like Tonya Gamer. On ?Riesday, Gamer stood outside and marveled at the nearly completed painting. She surveyed it and declared herself a fan. “I prefer for the government money to be spent for a beautiful mural rather than just cleaning up graffiti,? she said. “It’s awesome.

I leave with regret at not being able to change it? At Bailey’s Elementary, the total total enrollment this year surged above 1,300, making it the largest elementary school in the region. Within five years, its enrollment is projected to reach 1,600. Tistadt said much of the recent growth is driven by a high birth rate in the Bailey’s area, which has attracted many immigrant families. The school has become one of the most culturally diverse in the county. It is also home to some of the school system’s poorest students, with about 65 percent of the children children receiving free or reduced-price meals. The school, built in 1952, was last renovated in 1995, and it was designed to accommodate 1,000 students. Tistadt’s team set up 19 mobile classroom trailers to compensate compensate for the lack of space. Bailey’s Parent Teacher Association Association member Christine Adams, the mother of a fifth-grader, said children are crammed into “every nook and cranny.? “It’s been a problem plaguing us for years, and it gets progressively progressively worse,” Adams said. “The truth is, it’s just a matter of time until we hit the breaking point because you just can’t keep filling up a school that’s already over capacity.? Adams said that Tistadt was dedicated to helping the parents at Bailey’s find a solution to the school’s overcrowding problem. “J know he would have loved to wave his magic wand and fix it,? Adams said. “But he couldn’t.” A George Mason graduate, Tisrecent Tisrecent years, a key challenge has been the gentrification of the church’s Shaw neighborhood. “New folks show up like we don’t belong here, but we have been here and we ain’t going nowhere,” Smith said. He broke into tears as he reflected on how King and many others helped build up the church. “We are a people of hope.” JoAnne Beasley, general chairman chairman of the celebration, said the church will host anniversary events throughout the year. The church has “had trials and tribulations,” she said. “But we just want to thank Him and let the world know that Shiloh Baptist Church, at the comer of 9th and P, is moving on in God’s name.” Thomas Dixon Tyler, the church’s minister of music, said it was important that the service include hymns, anthems and contemporary contemporary gospel music. “What 21 slaves did here was to build a legacy that is reflective in our heritage,” he said. “They extended extended themselves, and so we incorporate every idiom of music and worship.” Mildred Carroll, 90, who has attended Shiloh for 75 years, said the church has meant “everything spiritually” in her life.

Tistadt said none of the options options were taken seriously. “They give one excuse after the other,” Tistadt said. Gross, who has represented the Mason district for more than 17 years, disputes Tistadt’s views of the Bailey?s predicament and said that she has put a lot of work into the issue. She said Tistadt’s plans to renovate the Woodrow Wilson library next to the school would have violated zoning ordinances. Bruce Variety founder bought into a life of sales early on A 1 John Kelly’s Washington Bruce Variety may f be in danger of i closing, but Bruce Ihimself is still ^ wUh open. Robert Bruce Dotson is 93 years old and he lives in Potomac, about seven miles from the beloved Bethesda store that he opened in 1953 and sold in 1985. The current owners are looking for a new home. Bruce is as sharp as the tacks he once sold alongside pins, needles, buttons, thread, spatulas, saucepans, loose-leaf paper, backpacks, poster paints and so on. He was bom in Paris, Ky., outside Lexington, “hard on the bluegrass,” he tells me. After Army service in World War II, he became a trainee at the J. J. Newberry Co., a five-and-dime chain that in those days was second only to Woolworth. His first assignment was to run the Newberry store in Lansford, Pa, in the heart of the coal mines. “Anthracite country,” he says. “It was a good store when the mines worked, but when they didn’t work there was nothing you could do but sit there.” His next store, in upscale Saratoga Springs, N.Y., had its own challenges. “You had racetrack people, people coming up for the water. In the wintertime, you died. In the summertime, you were competing with the racetrack and hotels for help.” It was so hard to find employees that Bruce had an idea: self-service. Rather than put a clerk behind each counter — stationery, toys, notions, etc. — you’d let customers select their own merchandise. He took the idea to his bosses. No, they said. The customers would steal you blind. But then a sympathetic board member gave him the go-ahead. “Sales immediately jumped some 20 percent, and there was no indication they were stealing us blind,” Bruce says. Bruce’s next idea? “I thought, if I can make money for them, I can make money for myself.” With $25,000 in savings he looked for a place to open a store. “I looked at areas not subject to strikes,” he says. “That’s how I came to the Washington area, where the government doesn’t go on strike.? I ask how he decided what to The crowding at Bailey’s “is a very serious matter, and I don’t deny that,” Gross said. “The solution solution has to be the right one, not just the one of the moment, because because it is a long-term investment, not a temporary solution.” School board member Sandy Evans, who represents the Mason district, has been a vocal advocate for addressing Bailey’s crowding woes and said that it’s time for the county to step up and help the schools solve the problem. “We must have the help from the county. These are their constituents, constituents, too,” Evans said. “They say, ‘Oh, that’s the school system’s problem.’ Yes, but simply there are times when the county needs to come in and step up.” Tistadt will be replaced by Jeffrey Platenberg, who was the Loudoun County public schools’ assistant superintendent for support support services. Platenberg is scheduled scheduled to begin work Tuesday. In retirement, Tistadt will live near Charlottesville in Fluvanna County, where he plans to kayak and keep up with the latest thrillers thrillers by John Sandford and Lee Child. Before his retirement, Tistadt gave a final presentation to the school board, outlining an $870 million budget to renovate facilities and build three elementary elementary schools and a high school between 2014 and 2018. Part of the plan includes a new elementary in the Bailey’s area. The plan will not move forward, however, until the administration, school board and Board of Supervisors can agree on where it should be built. shapirot@washpost.com LINDA DAVIDSON ?1HF WASHINGTON POS r Employee Ilopeton Dobbs manages shrinking inventory at Bruce Variety in Bethesda last week.

ON THE One Sunday night he was watching “The Dinah Shore Chevy Show” when a bunch of girls demonstrated a weird new plastic... thing. The next day Bruce was on the phone with his toy wholesaler. “I said, ‘I saw this thing on TV. I think we can sell them.’ “ ‘Naah,’ he said. So I went and ordered them direct from the manufacturer. I ordered 12 dozen and stacked them right between the two front doors. I put them out at 8 o’clock that morning and at 6 o’clock that night, I didn’t have a Hula Hoop left. That was the hottest item I ever had.” Not everything was a success. Bruce opened stores in Gaithersburg and Arlington. They were twice the size of the Bethesda store but never did the volume and closed after 10 or 15 years. “The thing is you’ve got to have the right mixture,” he explains. “Bethesda had the right mixture. It had home dwellers, and it had apartments. The trouble with the Arlington store was it was all apartments. By the time you got a following, they moved out and you had to start with somebody else. Same deal with Gaithersburg.” Bruce never had a computer in his stores. He never accepted credit cards. He’s never had a credit card. I ask him why he was successful. “I built a good organization,” he says. “The girl behind the counter creates the impression of the store. Customers don’t care who owns the store.” The fact that he funded a pension plan for his employees helped him keep top talent. “Our average sale was $4,” he says. “It took a lot of people to pay the rent” I ask Bruce whether the fact that he’d majored in economic.* at the University of Kentucky helped prepare him for a long career in retail. He thinks a moment. “No,” he says finally, “I learned more watching my parents lose the family farm during the Depression.” kdlyj@washpost.com To read previous columns, go to washmgtonpost.com/johnkdly.",1/7/2013,"('market', 'market', 'and')","('its', 'neighborhood', 'neighborhood')","[' Harris Shiloh Baptist Church, started in 1863 by freed slaves from Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, has survived two fires, a nearby open-air drug market market and gentrification of its neighborhood neighborhood in Northwest Washington.', '” A George Mason graduate, Tisrecent Tisrecent years, a key challenge has been the gentrification of the church’s Shaw neighborhood.']", Harris Shiloh Baptist Church started in 1863 by freed slaves from Fredericksburg Fredericksburg has survived two fires a nearby openair drug market market and gentrification of its neighborhood neighborhood in Northwest Washington  A George Mason graduate Tisrecent Tisrecent years a key challenge has been the gentrification of the churchs Shaw neighborhood

Gerald Ford wasn’t elected president or vice president. His vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, wasn’t elected either. It may not be surprising that a reader would forget that Ford became president because of Richard Nixon’s resignation, but it is surprising to me that The Post, which had so much to do with Nixon’s resignation, would publish the letter.

Seligman, who boasts being president of “the world’s largest association association of mental-illness workers,” would choose to label the mentally ill as crazy [“Don’t confuse evil with crazy,” op-ed, Jan. 4J. That says it all about the crazy, ahem, mental-illness system. While the bulk of Mr. Seligman’s commentary might have contained valid points, it was drowned out by his unnecessary labeling. I don’t hold out much hope for those struggling with various forms of mental illness when someone in a position of power uses the term in this way.

An attack on gentrification The Jan. 7 Metro article “Shiloh Baptist marks a milestone” began this way: “Shiloh Baptist Church, started in 1863 by freed slaves from Fredericksburg, has survived two fires, a nearby open-air drug market and gentrification of its neighborhood in Northwest Washington. Now it’s time to celebrate its 150th anniversary.” Are you kidding me? Comparing gentrification (code for white people who have money) coming to the neighborhood around this church to fires and an open-air drug market is an insult and should not be tolerated. Imagine the outcry if I were to suggest that my local church had survived two fires, an open-air drug market and minorities moving into the neighborhood. neighborhood. Martin Cain, Laytonsville Rejoicing over cheap cigars In the Jan. 3 “Intersections” article, “When the man fell off the roof’ [Metro], Robert Samuels wrote, “A homeless man exalted after discovering a box of cheap cigars lying on the ground.” Now, “to exalt” means “to hold in very high regard” or “to think or speak highly of.” As a transitive verb, however, it requires a direct object. The homeless man must have held someone or something in high regard. The cigars? The unknown person who dropped the box? Unclear. Perhaps what was meant is that the homeless man “exulted” — that is, felt jubilation — upon realizing that a box of cigars were now his very own. William A. Harrison III, Fredericksburg ALAMY The map of the world by Waldseemuller. Putting Paraguay on the map In his review of the book “On the Map” [“From early cartographers to GPS,” Book World, Jan. 6], Simon Winchester erred when he wrote of “Martin Waldseemueller (who first put the word ‘America’ on a map, though in the middle of Uruguay).” Paraguay and Uruguay are not interchangeable names, and neither is their location. Waldseemueller’s map, although primitive, placed the word “America” closer to what could be today’s Paraguay rather than Uruguay.

So imagine my shock to read, while Griffin was still on an operating table, that Courtland Milloy had chosen such a moment to grind his ax regarding the Redskins’ Redskins’ name and logo [“What’s in a name? For the Redskins, bad karma,” karma,” Metro, Jan. 9]. Milloy wrote that the reason Griffin “limp[ed] into battle on that iqjured knee” was because of the “bad karma” he has brought down upon himself by playing for Washington. Washington. Milloy then informed me that if I, as a diehard football fan, don’t agree with his assessment, he suspects that I have “only two ways of dealing with these kinds of disagreements: disagreements: racist Internet comments comments — and fistfights in the stands.” I don’t indulge in either activity, even when a bombastic columnist tries to pick a fight, exhibits such incredible insensitivity insensitivity to the feelings of others and maligns sports fans, our team and its quarterback all in one article.

To suggest that Robert Griffin Ill’s knee injury was payback for his team’s continued use of the name Redskins demeaned demeaned Griffin, the organization and their community of fans. I respect Milloy’s right to argue that the name should be changed, but RGIII’s injury should not be a platform platform for that change.

Falls Church ‘Beetle Bailey’ beatings lack any humor Regarding the Jan. 6 “Beetle Bailey” comic strip: How on earth, in this day and age, can you continue to run a “comic” that makes fun of a guy constantly getting beaten up? To top it off, it’s a guy serving his country being beaten up by his superior. What’s funny about that? I usually skip the strip, but I was lured in this time. Then bam! The last frame showed Beetle beaten up again by Sarge while the strip concluded, “Thank goodness there are plenty of them.” So it’s okay to beat up Beetle because, if he doesn’t pull through, there are more to replace him? For those of us who have served, been intimidated by a superior, beaten up or bullied — stop running running this comic! Lee Ann Can don, Edgewater JONATHAN NEWTON/THE WASHINGTON POST Washington’s Robert Griffin III leaves the field alter being injured. Penn State. In other words, the entire culture of venerating college football set the stage, and thus the imprisonment of Sandusky, the humiliating humiliating firing of coaching legend Joe Paterno and the summary dismissals dismissals of the athletic director and university president (both of whom now face criminal charges) are somehow insufficient deterrents to coverups. This line of reasoning maintains that the legions of Penn State alumni, alumni, fans, students and their families were, by their very adoration, complicit complicit in the egregious misconduct of the principals and deserved an extended stay in the NCAA’s woodshed woodshed to send the right message. Parents are equal teammates While reading the Jan. 6 WP Magazine article “The parent trap,” I found myself nodding in recognition recognition of the issues brought up and mentally patting myself and my husband on the back for, after our third child was born, deciding to tighten our belts and live on his salary so I could be an at-home parent. As I read of the stressful daily routines and the constant juggling of the families profiled, I understood exactly what they w ere going though, and I was grateful I was no longer among their stressed-out ranks. Then I read the sentence: “But reinventing the wheel is necessary for families that need two incomes or have partners that want to be equal.” “Equal?” Never once have I thought of myself as not being equal to my husband simply because because he works in an office for KING FEATURES SYNDICATE ?This reproof seems strange, coming coming from a newspaper that regularly regularly places Redskins developments on its front page and, on the morning morning after the Redskins’ recent playoff playoff defeat, chronicled the event with no less than 10 articles and columns.

Superstorm reality In the Jan. 6 editorial “The Sandy steamroller,” the use of the adjective “so-called” to modify the word “superstorm” was a poor choice, both objectively and subjectively. subjectively. Technically, the word choice might be accurate, but to many readers “so-called” connotes connotes an element of exaggeration or something negative about the truthfulness of an issue or a thing. If you were living or had loved ones living during Sandy and its aftermath in Far Rockaway, Breezy Point, the Jersey Shore or many other communities. I think that you might feel passionately that ?super” would hardly be a strong enough word to describe describe that storm. Linda R. O’Neill. Alexandria The shadow of conflict in Israel What about the traumatized Israeli children who face incessant incessant rocket attacks from Hamas terrorists in Gaza? The Jan. 6 news article “In Gaza, a childhood shadowed by conflict” devoted not a single w?ord to the thousands of rockets and mortars Hamas has fired at Israelis since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2005. War didn’t just strike again, as The Post describes the November conflict. Israel endured days of rocket attacks on its citizens until it began a defensive response to the onslaught. More than 1 million million Israelis sought safety in bomb shelters from the Hamas rockets, and the Israeli population lives in fear of the next round of Hamas attacks. But readers wouldn?t know that from this story. And while Hamas and its allies fire indiscriminately at Israelis, Israel has been extra-mindful of trying to avoid civilian casualties — often putting it at a tactical disadvantage. The Post failed to note that Hamas leaders hide among the civilian population. The article also left a misleading misleading impression about aid — Israel is permitting humanitarian aid to reach Gaza. Only two months after the latest fighting, Israel is allowing in concrete and building supplies, even though this risks having those materials used in rebuilding tunnels and other facilities facilities used to carry out a war of terror against Israel. Since its founding, Hamas has called for Israel’s destruction. That has not changed. The Palestinians Palestinians have refused for years to sit down with Israel to negotiate a peace deal. Daniel S.

Yet with the arrival of another Ihx Day, the idea of exempting D.C. residents from paying federal income taxes remains alive, if only at the margins.

He was “like a doctor making house calls,” said one of his parishioners, Kevin McCormally. If you were a regular at St Peter’s who missed Mass more than a couple of Sundays in a row, Father Mike (a.k.a.

If you were homeless and destitute, destitute, he might stop on the street and chat and maybe find you an odd job at his church, something to put a little money in your pocket or food in your tummy. If you were a street person, he’d welcome you to Sunday services at St. Peter’s. On his ambulatory rounds. Father O’Sullivan made several regular stops, including the National National Bank of Washington, two blocks from St. Peter’s, where he exchanged ritual greetings with his friend George A. Didden III, the late chief executive of the bank. “Top o’ the morning to you, Father.? “And the rest of the day to you, George.” From 1970 until he retired in 2005, Father O’Sullivan was pastor pastor at St. Peter’s and a visible presence just about everywhere on Capitol Hill.

But Norton isn’t pushing to give the District a break on April 15, in part because she doesn’t think that’s what most city residents want. At town hall meetings and on the streets, “I never hear it,” Norton said recently. “All I hear is statehood and voting rights.” TVvelve years ago, Norton thought that an income tax exemption exemption - at least until the city got voting rights - was a goal worth legislating. “We put the same demand to The Rev.

Senators and representatives representatives dispatched similar missives. So did veterans groups. As the correspondence stacked up in his inbox, Gates summoned Spencer and other members of the Defense Business Board. ■ Richard, my fax machine is vomiting letters of complaint,” Spencer recalled Gates telling him. Worried that congressional anger would doom other Pentagon Pentagon cost-cutting initiatives, Gates told Spencer to drop his commissary commissary plan. The commissary fight was an opening salvo — and a glimpse of the opposition — in the next big w ar facing the U.S. military: confronting confronting the enormous cost of pay raises, benefits programs and other other taxpayer-subsidized services, which have increased almost 90 percent since 2001 and have become become the fastest-growing part of the Defense Department’s budget. With Pentagon spending set to shrink over the next five years, senior military leaders warn that they will be forced to order reductions reductions in troop strength, training and equipment purchases if personnel personnel expenditures are not curtailed. curtailed. “We are on an unsustainable course,” said Arnold Punaro, a retired retired Marine major general who chairs the Reserve Forces Policy Board. ‘We are trading off activeduty activeduty combat readiness to protect all of these benefits.” Personnel costs now account for more than a quarter of all defense spending, which consumes consumes the largest single slice of the federal budget after Social Seurity. Seurity. Although no part of the Pentagon’s allotment is easy to cut - it is impossible to eliminate a weapons system or close a base without running into a welter of opposition — military pay and benefits will be among the most difficult to scale back, pitting growing demands for fiscal austerity austerity against promises to support those who serve to defend the country. in an era when private employers employers are reducing health care and pensions, the military continues to offer generous retirement benefits, benefits, including to service members members who have never spent a day in combat. For troops who remain in uniform for 20 years or more, the military provides an annual pension pension immediately upon retirement retirement — even if the retiree is 38 years old — equivalent to at least half of their final-years salary. Enrollment Enrollment for an entire family in a military health-care plan that operates operates much like a private health maintenance organization will cost a retiree just $539 this year, ibout one-ninth of what the averse averse non-military family will pay ?ut of pocket in HMO premiums. Those on active-duty also have bucked national trends. Over the 1 .i t dec ade, military salaries have grown at a faster rate than those of civilian workers. The average enlisted enlisted soldier now earns more i ban 90 percent of Americans who have less than two years of college. Most Army captains — the thirdmost-junior thirdmost-junior rank of officer — will rake home more than $90,000 this year. That compensation does not ‘cake into account a raft of other services subsidized by taxpayers: mmissaries, child care, schools jn domestic bases, and morale tnd recreation programs.

Mick Mulvaney’s office and began his rapid-fire pitch: Captain in the Minnesota National National Guard. Served in Baghdad and Kabul. Now running an organization organization of veterans and families. families. Sixty seconds in, when meetings meetings between veterans and members members of Congress usually turn to the importance of protecting health and retirement benefits, of the G1 Bill and disability benefits, Hegseth swerved in the other direction. Many active-duty personnel and retirees contend that their compensation and benefits are well-deserved, given the risks and strain associated with a military career. “We’re not overpaying these folks by any measure. We’re not giving them a sweetheart deal on health care,” said Norb Ryan, a retired vice admiral who runs the Military Officers Association of America, a 380,000-member organization organization that lobbies on behalf of active and retired personnel. “We owe it to them because they’ve put in decades of extraordinary extraordinary sacrifice on behalf of our nation.” But military leaders argue that they have no choice. Leon E. Panetta, Panetta, who served as defense secretary secretary until February, warned last year that if the growth in personnel personnel costs is not brought under control, “then we won’t be able to afford the training and equipment equipment our troops need in order to succeed on the battlefield.” At current trends, the military’s health-care spending will grow from $51 billion this year to $95 billion in 2030, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The military’s retirement system costs the federal government more than $100 billion a year. In two decades, the annual sum is projected to reach $217 billion. The benefits crisis is the result of more than shrinking budgets. Retirees are living longer and health care is becoming more expensive. expensive. But the biggest reason, according to military leaders and independent analysts, is Congress, Congress, which has sweetened pay and benefits packages over the past decade, often against the Pentagon’s wishes. “Nobody up here wants to be tarred as anti-military, and they don’t want to say no to the veterans veterans groups,” said a senior aide to a Republican representative on the House Armed Services Committee Committee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the subject candidly. “Those guys are organized organized — and they vote.” The commissary proposal, as envisaged by Spencer, actually would have provided a greater benefit to retirees. They would have received the same commissary commissary discount at large retailers closer to their homes, saving them from driving onto bases. “Nobody was going to have to pay more,” he said. “It was just a more efficient way to deliver the service.” The story of how the plan was developed - and how it died — is instructive, Punaro said, because “it shows just how broken the system has become.” From surplus to supermarket When Spencer was a young Marine Marine officer in the 1970s, commissaries commissaries sold basic staples on steel racks, much of it leftovers from the mess halls. Extra bags of pork chops. Loaves of sliced white bread. “Subsistence food,? he said. The commissary at Lejeune now rivals the nicest American supermarkets. There’s filet mignon mignon in the meat rack, wedges of Camembert in the cheese section and fresh baguettes in the bakery. Gone is the surplus feel. Every item is stocked in almost every flavor and size. There are two dozen varieties of Ocean Spray cranberry juice and 15 types of ketchup. “This is crazy? exclaimed Michael Michael Bayer, a corporate strategist in Washington who served as chairman of the Defense Business Board from 2007 to 2011.

Military pay includes salary, allowances for housing and food, and tax benefits. Retirees receiving pay After 20 years, military personnel become eligible for a pension, which they start getting upon retirement. This leads many to leave soon after two decades of service.

Items were sold to soldiers and their families at the same price it cost the government to acquire them. For decades, the stores remained a vital means of sustenance for those stationed on rural bases. IYansformations in the military military and civilian society over the following decades — including the expansion of large discount retailers near remote bases — obviated obviated the original reason for commissaries.

But it is unusual in its mission: Instead of advocating for more benefits, he wants to provide political cover to legislators legislators who want to make what he calls “tough decisions about our military.” “We’re here to help you when you stick your neck out,” he said. Hegseth’s group is not offering specific policy prescriptions, but it is supporting cuts of some sort — and that puts it in a unique niche in the battle over military funding. Lawmakers and their aides have been increasingly willing willing to meet with him in recent months, intrigued to hear his ies. This year’s subsidy - $1.4 billion billion — was authorized without a single question from legislators. ‘A tremendous deal’ The gentrification of the commissaries commissaries began in the name of efficiency. In 1990, the Pentagon decided to consolidate the separate separate grocery stores run by the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines Marines into a joint enterprise, reasoning reasoning that combining buying power and sharing overhead would reduce costs. A new bureaucracy, bureaucracy, the Defense Commissary Commissary Agency, was created to run the operation The new management set out to transform the base stores into modem supermarkets, with the same ambience as a Safeway or a Giant. Pharmacy items were added, added, as were fresh baked goods and organic foods. Commissaries now stock an average of 11,000 items. Because commissaries continue continue to sell goods at cost and everything everything is tax exempt, prices are, on average, about 30 percent less than at grocery stores off base.

Others see him as a traitor who is seeking to deprive active-duty personnel and veterans of well-deserved pay and benefits.

Legions of retirees, who also are eligible to shop, pou r onto Lejeune and other bases, often on weekends, to fill up carts. Some drive more than two hours each way to avail themselves of the privilege. Unlike with ordinary retailers, high volumes of traffic make the commissary system more costly to operate The sprawling store on Fort Belvoir in Northern Virginia had more sales last year than any other commissary — in excess of $100 million - but because none of that offset operating costs, the facility was among the most expensive expensive for the military. Many bases also have their own department stores, known as post exchanges, which operate on a different business model.

Although his organization has not come up with a list of proposed cuts, he said he would be in favor of transforming the current retirement retirement system — which provides pensions for those who stay for 20 years or more, and nothing for those who leave earlier — with a program that more closely resembles resembles a private-sector 401(k) plan",6/2/2013,"('tremendous', 'deal', 'the')","('the', 'commissaries', 'commissaries')",[' ‘A tremendous deal’ The gentrification of the commissaries commissaries began in the name of efficiency.'], A tremendous deal The gentrification of the commissaries commissaries began in the name of efficiency
26,1936293757,"Waiting for Columbia Pike’s redevelopment PIKE FROM Cl lumbia Pike from what was an auto-oriented strip through our neighborhood into a walkable main street that would serve the neighborhood’s needs without making us drive everywhere,” said Chris Zimmerman (D), the County Board member who has worked on the project since the 1990s. “We think it will be a gem of a place to live,” said Bob Brosnan, Arlington’s planning director, calling the goal “regional smart growth” — transit-oriented communities communities that retain their individual individual character. The goal — and challenge — is to make this happen with “no displacement” of the people who live in 6,200 affordable apartments, apartments, he said. The county’s plan is built upon twin pillars: new zoning laws and regulations that allow highdensity, highdensity, mid-rise housing and commercial development along the Pike, and a streetcar line that would tie all of the neighborhoods neighborhoods together and connect them to the Metro stations at Pentagon City or Crystal City. Federal subsidies for the streetcar have not materialized, however, and even the piecemeal development has unleashed a wave of gentrifkation that worries worries longtime residents. As such, Arlington’s struggles highlight the complexities involved in reimagining reimagining the region’s sprawling suburban strips — and the limitations limitations local governments are facing facing in the era of sequester. Similar pressures have surfaced surfaced in the White Flint area of Montgomery County, the western end of Alexandria and the Route 1 arts district in Prince George’s County. How do longestablished longestablished suburban communities communities evolve into denser, trendier destinations close to mass transit — without displacing longtime residents and losing their souls? At Cafe Sazon, known for its homemade soups and golden pupusas, pupusas, Torres shares the county’s vision, believing that denser development development and a modem streetcar streetcar would fill her tables. Torres’s mother, Eva, brought her to Arlington from Bolivia as a 7-year-old in 1989 to join her older daughter, Claudia. This is the only home Adriana Torres knows. She grew up along Columbia Columbia Pike and attended Arlington public schools. She earned a degree in architecture architecture from Catholic University in 2005 but lost her job at a Bethesda architectural firm at the start of the recession. That’s when the family got together and found a private loan to start the restaurant, which has to bring in $20,000 a month to break even. Right now, they’re a few thousand short “We’ve gone through so much — moving to another country is hard when you’re 40 and you don’t speak the language, like my mother did,” said Torres, who refuses to get depressed about the restaurant’s financial straits. “Anything worth doing is hard.” Not everyone is in favor of the changes along Columbia Pike. Residents are divided about whether more dense housing is a good idea. Debate over whether a streetcar is necessary, and worry over how the county will pay for ROBERT MCCARTNEY McDonnell must do much more to try to repair damage MCCARTNEY FROM Cl University political scientist Mark Rozell said. “I just don’t think voters will forgive this kind of behavior, where somebody in public life took advantage to profit personally.” Still, McDonnell could do a lot more to fulfill the goal he proclaimed Tuesday of regaining Virginians’ “sacred trust and confidence.” For starters, he should return or donate to charity all the gifts that his family received from Virginia businessman Jonnie Williams Sr. McDonnell said Ifiesday that he and his family have repaid $124,000 in what he says were loans from Williams. But he didn’t address some of the luxury gifts that have attracted much attention.

In April, the Federal TYansit Administration declined to fund the streetcar, doubting the $250 million price tag Arlington and Fairfax counties said it would cost.

He should repay the $15,000 catering bill for his daughter’s wedding and the $15,000 for the New York shopping spree by his wife, Maureen. McDonnell also needs to hold one of those lengthy, awkward news conferences to explain how his judgment went so askew and to say he’s learned his lesson. In his statement Tuesday, McDonnell said he was “deeply sorry” about the “embarrassment” that the controversy has caused the state. But he hasn’t answered follow-up questions or provided details. He tweeted the fourparagraph fourparagraph statement shortly before leaving the country on a hitherto secret trip to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops. If McDonnell opened up, many Virginians would be willing to listen. They have been impressed with his Pike, called the streetcar “massively “massively expensive” and predicted that its rails and overhead wires will hamper other vehicle traffic. She looks askance at the gentrification gentrification of the ethnically diverse diverse area, where two-thirds of the 36,000 residents are nonwhite. nonwhite. “I look at this as a two-edged sword,” Kennemer said. “Some people want the Pike to be an extension of downtown, but we live in a much more bucolic environment. environment. A lot of us don’t want it to turn into an extension of Ballston, Ballston, Clarendon or D.C.” Columbia Pike is closer to downtown Washington than parts of Bethesda or Silver Spring, but luring the free-spending free-spending hipsters and wealthy two-ingovernorship, two-ingovernorship, overall, until now. Even though his approval rating has slipped below 50 percent, it’s still in the middle to upper 40s — about the same as President Obama’s. “I think the door is not completely closed to him. I think the public wants to like him,” said Quentin Kidd, political science professor at Christopher Newport University. “They probably want to hear him say: ‘I made mistakes, but I didn’t do anything illegal— I’m trying to make amends for it’” Finally, McDonnell should make political ethics and gift reform the No. 1 priority of the remaining months of his term. Virginia’s laws on gifts to politicians are notably lax. There’s no restriction on gifts to elected officials, providing they’re disclosed. Gifts to family members need not be disclosed. “We miss the point here if he doesn’t take the lead in calling for stricter disclosure laws, at a minimum applying them to immediate family members and probably applying tougher penalties,” said former congressman Tom Davis (R-Va.).

The change is dramatic. There’s just more people here.” Business has grown every year since the wine shop opened three years ago, Robinson said.

That would also hurt his chances of obtaining a high-paying, privatesector privatesector job so he can relieve the financial pressure caused by illtimed illtimed real estate investments and Maureen’s expensive tastes. The biggest question in Richmond is whether a federal grand jury will indict the governor for public corruption under the Hobbs Act. The answer will depend partly on whether the U.S. attorney believes that there is evidence of a trade-off, a “quid pro quo,” between Williams’s largess and actions that the governor took to help the businessman, such as by helping to promote his company’s product. McDonnell has strongly denied that any such bargain took place.

Both candidates call for ethics reform and a limit on gifts to office-holders. Throughout the campaign, Obenshain has tried to steer clear of hot-button social issues, stressing his professional experience as the managing partner of one large law firm and the founder of another. He has stressed broad conservative themes such as “liberty” That harks back to a note discovered in his father’s desk after his death in a plane crash in 1978. Richard “Dick” Obenshain, who was campaigning for the U.S. Senate when he died, had written: “The most important goal in my life is to have a meaningful impact on preserving — and expanding — the realm of personal freedom in the life of this nation.” For Obenshain, that has translated into opposing the new federal health-care law and environmental regulations on coal and storm water, as well as sponsoring legislation to strengthen property rights and promote school choice. He has also stressed his legislative record related to criminal law, including sponsorship of bills that increased penalties for repeat drug offenders and sexual predators.

Herring has said that Obenshain is likely to take the attorney general’s office further down that activist path, one that he says has made Virginia a less appealing place to do business. “Time and again, he has bent and twisted the law and misused and abused the power of the office in order to advance personal ambition and an extreme ideological agenda,” Herring said of Cuccinelli in the debate. “Senator Obenshain would be a continuation of what we’ve got.” Herring has tried to make that argument by stressing social issues, highlighting his support for abortion rights, gay rights and stricter gun control while noting Obenshain’s opposition. At times, Obenshain has used the same forceful rhetoric that brought Cuccinelli to prominence. “Are you ready to stop Obamacare in its tracks?” he asked the cheering crowd that endorsed him at a May convention.

He said in June that he did not think Cuccinelli’s investigation of University of Virginia climate scientist Michael Mann had been warranted, for instance. And he has portrayed himself in a softer light in television ads. One shows Obenshain’s daughter, his driver throughout the campaign, behind the wheel. “My dad’s encouraged me to be strong and independent in pursuing my dreams,” she says in another commercial, which also features his mother. Obenshain has said that Herring would politicize the office, noting the Democrat’s reluctance to say whether he would defend Virginia laws he disagrees with, such as those banning gay marriage, allowing the state to take over failing schools and imposing strict voter ID requirements. It is the attorney general’s job to defend state law, Obenshain said, regardless of his personal opinion of them. When it comes to his own record, Herring has highlighted his sponsorship of legislation to strengthen penalties in domestic violence cases and to ban synthetic forms of marijuana. He has also stressed his support for a$1.4billion-a-year transportation funding overhaul passed this year, which Obenshain opposed. Iaura.vozzella@washpost.com ?

The 110-seat brewpub was founded by Thor Cheston, the Belgian-beer maven formerly of Brasserie Beck and Birreria Paradiso, and his wife, Leah Dedmon Cheston of West End restaurant Ris. Building out the brewery has been an “endlessly complicated” endeavor, Cheston said. They had to cram tanks into a too-small room. And one of the tanks is an open fermenter, procured from a winery, so the climate in the room needs to be just right. Many, many engineers have been involved involved in the process. “We have to have a certified steam engineer on the payroll,” Cheston said. “That was a big shock to the whole operation.” Also on the payroll is brewmaster brewmaster Nathan Zeender, whose mandate mandate is to brew a variety of original, original, unusual and challenging styles. “I wanted to call it a brewing workshop,” Zeender said.

Residents wondered why they were getting a gallery and not a school, while artists questioned whether anyone would come to see their work on that side of the river.

FROM TOMMIL AOAVS HONFLEUR GAUCRf Guests at Honfleur Gallery’s July reception came to view works created by artists from the District’s Wards 7 and 8. priced out of its previous home, in an area it had helped revitalize. “It shows that people aren’t fearful fearful of coming to Anacostia,” Gautier Gautier says. Meanwhile, the payday lender and empty buildings aren’t the gallery’s only neighbors on Good Hope Road. Gautier’s ARCH Development Development Corp., the nonprofit redevelopment redevelopment group that runs Honfleur, Honfleur, launched the Anacostia .Aits Center around the same time the Uniontown restaurant was opening. opening. Located just down the block from Honfleur, the brightly lit and chicly designed center is home to a black-box theater, a photography gallery, a small-business incubator (shared work spaces, focused on helping local start-ups get off the ground) and a cafe serving what is probably the only $5 coffee in Ward 8. By the end of the year, the empty building to Honfleur’s left will be filled by another D.C. artist: neon sculptor Craig Kraft. He’ll leave his current studio in Shaw? — what he says w r as an “up-and-coming” neighborhood when he moved in that has since “up-and-come”— in favor of the cheaper, edgier space in Anacostia. These are small changes, says local real estate agent Darrin Davis, Davis, not enough to turn a neighborhood neighborhood around. But he subscribes to Gautier’s view that they’re a catalyst catalyst for more. “It’s giving us a higher profile, and it’s bringing more people to the area to see that the area is not everything that you read about,” Davis says. Fear for the future While it’s true — at least anecdotally anecdotally — that the gallery has brought more visitors to Anacostia, Anacostia, it still struggles to market itself to lipeople living next door. “Honfleur, that’s that museum, right?” asks resident William Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey has walked past the gallery plenty of times but has never gone inside; he isn’t sure whether visitors must pay to enter. “A lot of people don’t really know about it,” adds Mike Wise, another Anacostia resident. Like Jeffrey, Wise has wondered about the gallery, but not enough to do more than peer through the windows. windows. That seems to be the case for many of Honfleur’s neighbors, whose attitudes toward the gallery range from apathy to mild curiosity. curiosity. A few view the gallery with more skepticism, concerned about what its presence means for the neighborhood. neighborhood. Might an art gallery and a playhouse lead to rising rents and shifting demographics? Dionne Brow r n, a resident of nearby Bellevue who attended last month’s exhibit opening, says she has many neighbors who feel that way. “Some people don’t believe this is truly reflective of the community, community, and I think that’s a demonstration demonstration of low expectations,” Brown says. “There?s a fear of anything nice being a sign that they’re being forced out” After all, they’ve seen it happen before. Anacostia residents look at the transformation of other onceneglected onceneglected neighborhoods that were colonized by art galleries — H Street, the 14th Street corridor — and wonder whether the same changes could be coming their way. “Developers run this city... and we don’t have much of a community community to push back on that, to stem that,? says Kymone Freeman, cofounder cofounder of a progressive radio station station around the comer from Honfleur.

If we don’t do something different east of the river, a lot of what made D.C. what it w r as is going to be forgotten.” forgotten.” Hani Ahmed, who grew up in Anacostia and participated in an ARCH youth program that has since been disbanded, puts it more bluntly: “I see all these white folks in there, going in every weekend,” he says. “But w?hat are they doing for our commupity?” Ahmed says he is skeptical that Honfleur’s mere presence is doing much for the area. He’d like to see more outreach, more youth programs programs and more opportunities for locals to get involved — especially because the gallery is receiving government funding, from the National National Endowment for the Arts and the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities. Ann Fields, the owner of LAThreadz LAThreadz Couture clothing down the street, shares Ahmed’s concerns. “I think a lot of people don’t understand it. so they don?t feel welcome,” she says. “You’d think they’d want to pull the community in, give something back.” Honfleur’s creative director, Beth Ferraro, acknowTedges that the gallery has room to improve in terms of outreach: She still gets visitors who, like Jeffrey, confuse it with a museum. And though it’s true that ARCH no longer offers art classes or youth programs, she says that Honfleur is using its limited budget to fill a different niche in the community. “We can’t do everything,” she says. “But showing artwork, giving exposure to local artists, having in your community a place where you can go and be proud of: That’s a great thing, too.” Gentrification lite And largely, people in the neighborhood neighborhood who have worked with the Honfleur Gallery view it as a model of development done right.

The projects the company pursues — art galleries, studio rentals — are much less likely to lead to displacement than, say, a fancy condominium would. Freeman Freeman calls Honfleur the “kinder, gentler form of gentrification,” a form he’s happy to see in his neighborhood. neighborhood. “They have walked the fine line of bringing in, you know?, more affluent clientele into this area, and at the same time have not appeared to be a pariah in the community. That’s a difficult walk, and I think they’ve done it well,” Freeman says. For James Terrell, one of the artists featured in the “East of the River” showcase, the main benefit of the gallery isn’t economic or political. It’s that Honfleur has ereated a home for local art in an area where no me thought such a thing could succeed Standing in the crowded gallery last month, Terrell grins at each visitor who pauses in front of his work: two colorful, richly textured oil paintings, one of a man holding a radio, the other of a young woman woman hugging herself. Terrell grew up just down the street from Honfleur, and although although he has participated in this exhibit every year since 2008, it’s still hard for him to believe that he’s seeing his art showcased here on Good Hope Road. “This neighborhood, when 1 was growing up, was a whole other world,” he says — one where it was radical to even consider art as a career. Now?, though, “there are young people in this area who are artists who are going to see this and think, ‘I could have my art displayed.”’ surah.kaplan (w wash post.com Russell arl auctioned for millions by Martin Griffith RENO, NEV. — A total of 30 Charles M. Russell works fetched millions of dollars at auction in Reno, with one painting, symbolizing the railroad’s railroad’s effect on American Indians, drawing $1.9 million and another, depicting a Native American chief. $1.1 million. Other top prices at the annual Coeur d’Alene Art Auction last week included $1.7 million for a Frederic Remington painting featuring featuring a group of Indians and $1.5 million for a Thomas Moran painting depicting an Arizona gulch. Russell artwork is highly sought after, auction organizer Mike Overby Overby said, and commanded from about $25,000 for small sketches to $1.9 million for his 1924 watercolor “ IYail of the Iron Horse.” The painting shows a group of Indians on horseback looking down at railroad tracks with the sun setting on the open plains in the background. “It’s a very iconic image, absolutely absolutely one of his best.” Overby said. “There’s so much symbolism in that painting. I think that’s what really grabs people’s heartstrings. Russell is still considered the absolute absolute blue-chip artist of our genre.” Russell’s romantic 1897 “Dakota Chief,” which sold for $1.1 million, depicts a young Native American on horseback, wearing a longtailed longtailed feathered headdress and carrying carrying a lance. While Russell was known as “the cowboy artist? in his early days, he actually painted more Indian subjects, historians say. Remington’s 1907 “The Story of Where the Sun Goes,” which fetched $17 million, depicts several young Indians sitting in a grove of trees and listening to an elder. “His large oils are extremely rare and hardly ever come to market, and when they do, there’s .ilways interest in them,” Overby said. More than 650 registered bidders bidders took part in w?hat was billed as the world?s largest Western art sale. About 320 works were sold for .about some $30 million, nearly the same as last year’s $30.5 million. —Associated.

1064,1938303127,"► if • 1 ??* r *HI AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER EDITORIALS Rough justice Hank of America’s fine doesn?t resolve the ?too big to Jail? problem. USTICE IS being clone to Bank of America — rough justice. The bank last week reportedly buckled to the Justice Department’s threat of litigation over alleged misdeeds in the mortgage-backed mortgage-backed securities market, offering to pay upward of $ 16 billion to settle the matter, more than half of it as a cash fine. (The rest may be in the form of future relief to borrowers.) If the deal goes through, it would amount to the largest such exaction related to the Great Recession. Bank of America would not quite be paying for its own sins but rather for allegedly faulty mortgage securities sold by two companies — Countrywide and Merrill Lynch — that the bank absorbed, with government encouragement, during the crisis. It’s not exactly a case of no good deed going unpunished; unpunished; though it pleased Washington by bailing out those firms, B of A also intended to make a profit, and it knew it was buying the firms’ legal liabilities as well as their assets. Still, the wrongdoing, if any, involved securities sold to sophisticated institutions, institutions, not hapless widows and orphans. I low nol lo pick a judge Elections and politics are bad for the courts. 1 AST WEEK’S elections in Tennessee brought yet another reminder that judicial . races, which the vast majority of states A conduct, are a corrosive practice that should end. Leading up to the poll, Ron Ramsey, Tennessee’s Republican lieutenant governor, helped to wage a sharp campaign against three state supreme court justices, ail appointed by a former Democratic governor. The effort to oust the judges included accusations that they are soft on crime — a standard charge lobbed at judges in election campaigns — and that they aided Obamacare. The latter is particularly ridiculous, flimsily based on the fact that a Tennessee attorney general, whom the state supreme court selects, declined to join in a lawsuit against the health-care law. Even so, the judges felt compelled to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to beat back the assault, itself fueled by hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr. Ramsey’s political action committee committee and national conservative activist groups. Though the judges eventually prevailed, the fact that they had to politick their way back to the bench discredits the notion that they will be fair to all who enter their courtroom. Thirty-eight states have judicial elections of some kind for seats on their supreme courts — whether fully contested races or retention elections elections in which only an appointed incumbent is on the ballot, ?lypically, these elections aren’t major contests, which can be a problem in itself. Former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O’Connorpointed O’Connorpointed out that many judicial candidates in what are supposed to be contested elections run unopposed, which means they are not vetted by voters, elected politicians or expert panels. Even in races with two or more candidates, often few people pay attention — and the ones most likely to care are those with direct stakes in how courts will rule. Defense attorneys face off against plaintiffs’ Ride on: ? Va. officials strike a deal with liber and Lyft to allow hail-by-app car companies to serve the public. r WO MONTHS after they tried to shut down ride-sharing services that allow users users to hail a car using a smart phone app, A Virginia officials have shifted gears. They struck an agreement with Uber and Lyft, two of the biggest ride-sharing companies, that will allow the companies to continue operating under rules that provide sensible protections for passengers passengers and an alternative means of transport that has proved increasingly popular with the public. This move could offer a template for other states, including Maryland, where last week the body that oversees utilities and transportation ruled that ride-sharing companies should be subject to state regulation. The impulse to stifle companies like Uber has been on display in a number of U.S. and European cities where long-established taxi companies see ride-sharing as a threat to their business model. Cab drivers saw the new ride-sharing firms, free of licensing and regulatory requirements, as enjoying enjoying a competitive leg up. They cried foul; in some LOCAL OPINIONS Join the debate at washing*onpost.com/localopinion n Selling Carver Langston short In “The generous soul beneath the chaos of Carver Langston” [The Washington Post Magazine, Magazine, Aug. 3], Darcy Courteau painted a narrow and inaccurate view of a neighborhood rich in cultural diversity. The boundaries of Carver Langston extend.beyond Langston and Carver terraces, and the neighborhood has many longstanding longstanding residents who do not live in subsidized housing or appear to be inhabitants of a ?refugee camp.” While the author may feel pioneering to be in the racial minority, she has exaggerated the racial disparity. My husband and I moved to Carver Langston in 2010, the year before Ms. Courteau. There were at least two other Caucasian households on our The bank quit fighting the Justice Department after a federal court in New York ordered a fine of more than $1 billion in another case, signaling that litigation risks were much higher than it anticipated anticipated — and that its real interest lay in legal finality, which it now apparently has. Just or not, no one should confuse this pending settlement with a solution to the deeper problem of the U.S. financial system — namely that Bank of America and other institutions remain too big to fail. The prospect of a taxpayer rescue in the next crisis still threatens the U.S. government’s finances and may distort the flow of capital by implicitly subsidizing subsidizing the giants, ?lb be sure, the biggest banks have raised capital and are on a much sounder footing than they were before the crisis. Also, the degree-of implicit subsidy remains disputed. A new Government Government Accountability Office report suggests that large bank holding companies had no advantage in funding costs in recent years - i.e., a period of relative financial calm — but that they would enjoy an advantage over smaller institutions during crises. TOM TOLES advocates. But more judicial races are becoming high-profile, high-profile, and that’s also bad. Political parties and conservative and liberal pressure organizations are spending more to knock out judges they see as ideological opponents. According to a Brennan Center for Justice analysis, $56.4 million was poured into judicial elections in the most recent major election cycle, nearly half of it from non-candidate groups. The results of applying the ideological polarization polarization that dominates the political branches to judicial races, meanwhile, are consistently unattractive. unattractive. One-issue voting dominates some contests, contests, such as the successful effort to oust Iowa cases, policymakers overreacted. In fact, the cabbies were right, up to a point. It’s reasonable to adopt regulations for the new hail-by-app car industry. The trick is to tailor those regulations so that they protect passengers without without stifling competition. Virginia appears to have managed that. The new rules mandate background checks for drivers that will disqualify those with serious criminal records, including sex offenders, as well as any with poor driving records — especially if they include drug or alcohol violations. The burden burden for collecting and maintaining drivers’ records records will rightly be on the ride-sharing companies. In addition, Uber and Lyft cars must be properly properly registered and inspected, and the firms will have meet rigorous insurance requirements. In a gesture designed to mollify cab drivers, the regulations regulations make clear that passengers can only summon summon Uber and Lyft cars through their smartphone apps. not by hailing them in the street. The regulations are a temporary fix; Virginia block of single-family rowhouses. Today there are also first-generation Asians and residents of Latin Latin origin. Besides the strong sense of community, we also chose this neighborhood for its excellent location, including proximity to the U.S. National Arboretum, the U.S. Capitol and the Mall. Writing as if Carver Langston is a neighborhood neighborhood to be “pioneered” overlooks the rich fabric of what was here before Ms. Courteau’s arrival and furthers the deep racial divide of which many District residents are acutely aware. 1 encourage her, and all D.C. residents, to look beyond their preconceived ideas to build communities that bridge racial divides, not reinforce them. Stephanie Sneaky, Washington And, according to the logic of a recent joint decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve, that is precisely the problem: Any crisis large enough to threaten one bank would probably be large enough to jeopardize them all, milking a government bailout inevitable. The FDIC and the Fed thus rejected “living wills”that the 11 largest U.S. banks had submitted under a provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law requiring them to plan credibly for orderly liquidation. The mere fact that the plans lacked transparency, FDIC Vice Chairman ?Thomas Hoenig noted, shows that the banks’ recent capital-raising and streamlining “only marginally strengthened their balance sheet to facilitate their resolvability, should it be necessary.” The regulators’ rejection of the living wills was not unexpected, and the banks have a year to fix them. Still, it reminded banks of the need to simplify their businesses and keep leverage to manageable levels, a warning they’ll heed if they want to avoid more drastic shrinkage at the hands of regulators or Congress. judges who ruled in favor of same-sex marriage or the unsuccessful campaign against a Wisconsin supreme court justice whom critics attacked as a proxy for Gov. Scott Walker (R). Elsewhere, conservatives have accused judges of helping to free terrorists and of sympathizing with rapists; liberals have accused judges of covering up sexual abuse by priests and of helping to deny treatment to cancer patients. The application of due process and the maintenance maintenance of Americans’ civil rights should be more isolated from the pressures of majoritarian elections. elections. States with judicial elections — such as Maryland — should adopt a fully appointmentbased appointmentbased system to select their judges. officials say legislation is needed to codify the new regime. So far, the ride-sharing companies are fine with the rules. Our support for Uber predates The Post’s purchase purchase last year by Jeffrey P. Bezos, who is an investor in Uber. ?The logic of encouraging the ride-sharing industry is clear: As anyone who has tried to hail a cab in the rain or at rush hour can attest, taxis are too few and too unreliable to satisfy demand in Washington, as in many other cities. In cities where taxi prices are prohibitive, the new services provide an alternative for passengers, passengers, some of whom may have no access to public transit to get to and from work. Moreover, if ride-sharing companies can offer an attractive and economical alternative to car ownership — which is precisely what they aspire to do — they could induce some people to give up their cars, which would make a dent in traffic and pollution. That would be an important achievement achievement that goes beyond enhanced convenience for well-heeled urban 20-somethings. Eljc hiasljington post KATHARINE WEYMOUTH.

Business, Aug. 71. Many people do not know that there are few options for care for the terminally ill. especially for Medicare recipients. Hospitals are not able to provide long-term care, and nursing homes often cost more than $6,000 a month out of pocket. In-home care can be a viable but physically and emotionally taxing option, though many people prefer to be surrounded by their relatives relatives in their own environment. Hospice team members members provide this emotional and physical support by training the caregivers to tend to their loved ones. 1 would love for a Post reporter to follow hospice nurses on our daily rounds to see the care and support we provide. There are many reasons for the “live” discharges, and reporting our perspective would clear up many misconceptions. Pavla Refo, Wurrentail Protecting seniors from abuse The Aug. 4 Metro article “In Va., a cautionary tale for seniors” talked about elderly abuse and fraud, a scenario that is all too common. And it will continue to be, as long as there is no coordinated, federally funded system in place to prevent it. Congress has established and funded national networks networks to protect children — and even animals — from abuse, but no similar system exists to protect vulnerable vulnerable adults. It’s time for Congress to prioritize the health and safety of all Americans, regardless of age. Nearly 5 million seniors are victims of abuse, neglect or exploitation each year. Direct medical costs associated with elder abuse exceed $5 billion annually, and older victims of financial abuse, such as Pearl Buckley, the woman in the story, lose an estimated $2.9 billion each year. Vulnerable adults deserve the same protections our society affords their pets and grandchildren. We must call upon Congress to make this a reality by fully funding the bipartisan Elder Justice Act, which it passed in 2010 but has yet to fund. ?The system failed Ms. Buckley. Don’t let it fail anyone else. Martha Roherty, Washington The writer is the executive director of the National Association Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities. Congress bears some if the blame Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee is one of the more pragmatic Republicans in Congress. But his Aug. 6 op-ed piece “A president of empty words,” was anything but. Mr. Corker seemed to believe that all of the challenges, bloodshed and confusion that have come to define international politics today are President Obama’s fault. Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Libya, it doesn’t matter: The White House is the instigator of disaster. This argument is not only unfair; it’s also wrong. If the United States flrere a monarchy, perhaps Mr. Corker’s complaint would be accurate. But this is a democracy, and Congress is an integral part of the foreign policy machinery. Yet on some of the very same issues that Mr. Corker deeply cares about, Congress is either slow in taking action or divided on what action it should take. On Syria, Congress has taken zero action on the administration’s request for $500 million in military aid to the moderate opposition. On Russia, Republicans Republicans draft sanctions bills that. while tough, fail to get Democratic support. And on Libya, Americans see more televised hearings on Benghazi than on what is now practically a civil war among competing militias militias in that country. None of this is to defend Mr. Obama entirely. Nor is it to dismiss the valid questions that Mr. Corker asked. It’s only to point out that Congress is not free from fault either. Daniel R.

He was 83. His death was announced on the Nobel Prize’s Web site. The announcement did not report where or how he died.

Poetry was a parallel occupation occupation — an outlet for what his Nobel citation described as his “condensed, translucent images” that give “us fresh access to reality.” reality.” The prize, bestowed by the Swedish king, came nearly six decades after the publication of Mr. Transtromer’s first volume of verses, “17 Poems” (1954). The debut identified Mr. TYanstromer, not yet 24, as one of his country’s most promising poet6. He followed that book with more than a dozen others, including including collections published in English English as “Windows and Stones” (1972), “Baltics” (1975), “The Sorrow Sorrow Gondola” (1997), “The HalfFinished HalfFinished Heaven” (2001) and “The Great Enigma” (2006).

One moves from inside, one moves from outside and where they meet we have a chance to see ourselves. He who notices what is happening happening cries despairingly: “Stop!

His programs would always begin with a soul-stirring gospel selection, followed by tearful confessions confessions from radio callers and concluded with one of his sermons from “the Cathedral.” “Bishop Long was a staple on WYCB for more than 37 years,” said Karen Jackson, general sales manager for Radio One. “He was one of our first pastors who would do his broadcast live from our studios and from church.” Bishop Long enjoyed tackling thorny issues that were often connected connected to the latest of his many books. One book, “What About the Woman,” examined the issue of whether a woman should preach. He also wrote a great deal about baptism. He welcomed several controversial controversial figures to his church, including including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on the eve of the quently venture into politics in his writings. He said that he achieved his social engagement through his professional life, which included employment for a time at a boys prison. He regarded his work and poetry poetry as interconnected and thought it strange, he once remarked, remarked, that while readers sometimes sometimes asked how psychology affected affected his poetry, no one ever inquired the opposite. Among juvenile delinquents, he noticed a tendency to describe their transgressions in the passive voice, as if their crimes had happened happened to them rather than because because of them. “The way you express express yourself,” he told The Washington Washington Post in a 1986 interview, “is the way you experience things.” Tomas Gosta TYanstromer was born in Stockholm on April 15, 1931. His mother was a teacher, and his father was a journalist. He was drawn both by the sciences and by the arts, with early fascinations fascinations including insects and the piano.

Scripture Cathedral was involved involved in many relief efforts, including including after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Haiti earthquake in 2010. The church staged many Thanksgiving giveaways of turkey dinners. “Rev. Long was a spiritual icon who was a major player in the community and abroad,” said the Rev. Charlene Monk, pastor of the New Horizon Christian Center. “During the time of Hurricane Katrina, Katrina, he went down there and was always giving out food, clothing and water.” Over the years, Scripture Cathedral Cathedral was embroiled in several racially charged issues surrounding surrounding the growing gentrification of its Shaw neighborhood. There was a particularly charged period in in 1956 from Stockholm University, University, where he studied literature, religion, history and psychology.

After his stroke, he continued to write, although more slowly than he had before. On the piano, he played works composed for the j left hand. “In the evening darkness in a place outside New York, a viewpoint viewpoint where one single glance will encompass the homes of eight million people,” began his poem “Schubertiana.” “I know too — without statistics — that right now Schubert is being played in a room over there and that for someone the notes are more real than anything else.? em ily. longer @ washpost. com 2006, when a gay bar was seeking city approval to open across the street from the church at Ninth and O streets NW. “If this is a gay club, that’s bad for the kids,” Bishop Long told The Washington Post at the time. “I’ve been a pastor in Shaw for 46 years. Folks need to understand that this church, all churches, play a big part in the community. I have my own opinion on the gay lifestyle, but I don’t fight them — they’re welcome to come to our church, because I’m in the business of changing lives.” In 2013, when it was reported that the church had reached an agreement to sell its District sanctuary sanctuary for $10 million to move to Maryland, Bishop Long explained that he wasn’t leaving the Shaw neighborhood but was going to have “one church at two locations ” Scripture Cathedral currently holds services at its original location location and in Landover, Md.

And you might think that, by now, the street would be jampacked jampacked with yoga studios, farm-totable farm-totable restaurants and stores selling gluten-free pet food.

Perhaps the necessity of dealing dealing with that darker element of surrealism explains the exhibition’s exhibition’s other central theme: the lasting importance of biomorphism biomorphism during and after the heyday heyday of what we commonly think of as the core of the surrealist endeavor. Biomorphism. which celebrated organic lines and fluid fluid contours as found in nature, emerged partly within surrealism surrealism and is presented in the context of this exhibition as a philosophical alternative to the direction taken by Giacometti and his more singularly sex-obsessed peers. The hero of this contrasting narrative is Jean Arp, a German-French artist who moved to Paris in 1925 and had a profound impact on Joan Miro and Max Ernst (both of whom figure prominently in the exhibition). Among the a must-visit destination. Featuring music and lyrics by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, and a book by Jeff Whitty, “Avenue Q” showcases characters who are puppets puppets brought to life by visible oi istage actor-puppeteers as well as characters characters embodied by actors.

This fall, Penguin has also reissued reissued “The Case Against Satan” ($15), by Ray Russell, a sleek, compelling tale of diabolical possession possession that prefigures Ira Levin?s “Rosemary’s Baby.” So, too, does the unsettling title novella about a family curse visited upon a new bride in David Case’s “Fengriffen ?

They are colorful, fluent pieces, built from layers of painted wood, and after a century of imitations, imitations, it’s not easy to fully appreciate their novelty and impact. But they were made years before 1924. when Andre Breton published his first surrealist surrealist manifesto, and they are almost purely abstract. In the context of so much harsh and destabilizing work, they feel radically anodyne, decorative and humble. Duchamp appreciated appreciated Arp’s work in this vein Unfolding on scenic designer A.J.

In “’Songs of a Dead Dreamer’ and ‘Grimscribe’ ” ($17) Penguin has coupled his first two collections, from 1986 and 1991. No matter how nightmarish nightmarish the events described, Ligotti’s Ligotti’s prose is always precise and beautifully controlled.

One is a route back to childhood, to the uncensored fecundity of play and experimentation; the other is liberation from restraint, restraint, with a particular fixation fixation on unfettered desire. The two are by no means mutually exclusive.

DJ COPtl PHOTOGRAPHY Matt Dewberry holds the puppet for Princeton, the star of Constellation Theatre Company’s production of “Avenue Q.? “Awaiting Strange Gods: Weird and Lovecraftian Fictions” (Fedogan (Fedogan ? Bremer; hardcover, $39.95). In “Class Reunion,” for example, the unfortunate alumni of Orne Academy, founded by Joseph Curwen and Jedediah Orne (from Lovecraft’s ?The Case of Charles Dexter Ward”), assemble assemble to learn their unspeakable destiny. In “The Runners Beyond the Wall,” Schweitzer expertly blends the Lovecraftian with elements elements from M.R. James’s “Lost Hearts,” producing an unnerving tale of near immortality and a deal with something w?orse than the devil. As scholar ST Joshi’ notes in his introduction, Schweitzer is one of fantastic literature’s Renaissance Renaissance men, moving easily from fiction and poetry to criticism to the in-depth author interview. If you’re already a devotee of the just-mentioned M R. James, you can enjoy much the same eerie atmosphere of his “ghost stories of an antiquary” in the work of his early admirers, affectionately affectionately dubbed the James Gang. These include H. Russell Wakefield, A.N.L. Munby and — new to me — Henry Chapman Mercer, whose 1928 collection, “November Night Tales,” has just been issued by Valancourt ($16.99). It opens with “Castle Valley,” in which two young men discover a mysterious crystal that allows them to glimpse a nowvanished nowvanished Gothic castle, a vision that dramatically alters their So if there is a central message to the exhibition, it is this: that there is no play and no freedom without all these other energies inevitably being released. Even biomorphism, with its charismatic charismatic analogues from the natural natural world, has its haunted side. The innocent and guilty sides of pleasure unleashed by the surrealist surrealist liberation flow into one another without clear lines of demarcation, like the insides and outsides of biomorphic sculptures sculptures by Henry Moore or Barbara Hepworth. And both Moore and Hepworth are present here, drawing the energies of surrealism surrealism into the period during and after World War II. So, too, Isamu Noguchi, who is represented by work he made while interned (voluntarily) at a prison camp in Arizona. Biomorphism was also touching as Princeton and Kate Monster. Alferov’s Nicky is especially especially endearing when he sings the optimistic “If You Were Gay” to Rod. And Emily Zickler is dynamite dynamite as Lucy the Slut, whose every look and move oozes sexiness. All the aforementioned characterizations characterizations involve puppets, which the actors handle ably. Among the non-puppet acting turns, Eben K. I^ogan is particularly droll as a building superintendent who turns out to be the former child star Gary Coleman. “Avenue Q” is full of delectable gags, such as the pile of packing boxes that turns into a chorus line. During and between such moments, moments, director Stockman and choreographer Rachel Leigh Dolan keep the action moving. While the singing is in some cases more competent than soaring, the six-person band sounds fine. Although no onslaught of juice bars has yet to ratchet up TYekkie lives. Some argue that James’s genteel, genteel, old-fashioned storytelling w?as a dead end, and that Arthur Machen or Algernon Blackwood should be viewed as Britain’s true “opener of the way” to modern fiction of the supernatural. This pair’s two supreme masterpieces. masterpieces. Machen’s “The White People” and Blackwood’s “The Willows,” are available in “Shadows “Shadows of Carcosa: Tales of Cosmic Horror,” edited by D. Thin (New? York Review Books, $15.95). Machen’s Machen’s “The Bowmen? is known even to nonreaders, since it represents, represents, as Richard J. Bleiler observes observes in “The Strange Case of ‘The Angels of Mons’ ” (McFarland, (McFarland, $39.95), a pre-Internet instance instance of an idea “going viral.” This World War I tale of angelic archers who answer the prayers of desperate British soldiers almost almost instantly passed from fiction fiction into supposed fact: German infantrymen were even said to have been found dead of arrow w?ounds. Bleiler reprints the original original story, as well as articles in support and refutation of this early example of an urban myth. For more World War I strangeness, strangeness, one might turn to the distinctly distinctly pulpish title story of ‘The Broken Fang and Other Experiences Experiences of a Specialist in Spooks,” by Uel Key (Ramble, $20).

Ovens used for warmth in lieu of heat. It is all part of the “outrageous? saga of a “slumlord” in one of the District’s poorest neighborhoods, lawyers and tenants testified before before the D.C. Council on Thursday night. But more troubling, council members said during the threehour threehour hearing, is that while the tenants of four rent-controlled apartments in Southeast may be experiencing one of the most egregious egregious — or at least the most publicized publicized — housing debacles in recent recent city history, they are hardly alone. Rather, a hearing meant partly to determine a solution for a small group of tenants in the Congress Heights neighborhood of Southeast Southeast cracked open a larger chasm of flaws and missing pieces in the city government’s stated mission to protect poor D.C. residents from displacement amid the rapid redevelopment and gentrification of District neighborhoods. Among them are a flawed Itenant Itenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA), which, while designed to protect tenants from displacement displacement amid redevelopment, is actually actually “extremely hard to execute,” council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) said. MARYLAND Attorney general lauds hate-crime prosecutions, tight to protect voting rights Lynch: This country should he a safe place ... for all who seek freedom’ by Ian Siiapira U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, the first African American American woman to helm the nation’s chief prosecutorial office, addressed addressed hundreds of Maryland residents and political leaders Saturday morning at a breakfast commemorating Black History Month, touting the Justice Department’s Department’s crackdown on hate crimes and its fight to protect voting rights. “We’ve gone to court to defend the right to vote that so many And then there are the ways in which lawyers and tenant advocates advocates alleged that the city has facilitated facilitated the actions of “bad actor” landlords and developers; approving approving the development plans of companies companies that have racked up code violations, or even handing such “actors” government funding to house the homeless and other vulnerable vulnerable residents. The Congress Heights tenants have long alleged that their landlord, landlord, Bethesda-based Sanford Capital, is trying to push them out to make way for a more lucrative development plan involving office buildings, apartments and retail shops. Their complaints, court filings and public testimony over the past two years led to an investigation and subsequent lawsuit filed last month by D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine — an event that Council Chairman Phil Mendelson Mendelson (D) said he could not recall seeing in more than 15 years on the council. On Monday, tenants, government government officials and a representative representative from Sanford Capital are expected expected to testify at D.C. Superior Court, where Racine will ask the court to assign a new temporary owner to manage the properties and make needed repairs. “What this case more broadly illustrates is how development is done in Washington, D.C.,” testified testified Will Merrifield, a lawyer at the fought so hard to secure, because as we take this month to consider hallowed places, for African Americans surely, surely the voting voting booth must be one of them,” Lynch said to applause. “We’ve convicted more defendants on hate crimes charges than in any other time in history because this country should be a safe place... for all who seek freedom.” Her remarks were delivered at the 35th annual Fifth Congressional Congressional District Black History Month Breakfast, which was held at Camelot by Martin’s catering hall in Prince George’s County. The event, whose previous speakers speakers have included President Obama and former attorney general general Eric H. Holder Jr., was emceed emceed by Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). In his remarks introducing introducing Lynch, the longtime conWashington conWashington Legal Clinic for the Homeless who has represented the tenants association. “It is a rough and dirty process that benefits benefits a lot of people at the top of the food chain and is devouring people people below.” A. Carter Nowell, a principal at Sanford Capital, did not respond to questions about the case on Friday. But as the Congress Heights tenants detailed the year-long creep of a building-wide bedbug infestation, their battles against mice and, more recently, a collapsed collapsed ceiling, council members posed a broader question: How do we fix this? “We need to understand that this kind of situation looms in many buildings, and we really need to get on that,” council member member Anita Bonds (D-At Large), who chairs the council’s Committee on Housing and Community Development, Development, said Friday. Tenants and their advocates testified that they want to see changes to the city’s TOPA law — and they want the government to stop partnering with companies that have a known record of abuses. Under District law, building owners are required to provide tenants tenants with TOPA notices — the opportunity opportunity to purchase their housing housing units — before the company is allowed to evict them to make way for a demolition or redevelopment. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch gets a thumbs-up from Rep. Steny H. Hoyer daring her speech at the Black History Month breakfast. Picnic in the cathedral Hundreds of people, including Edwin Bello and Paula Gonzalez, at left, brought their blankets and baskets Friday evening for a picnic inside Washington National Cathedral, the closing event of its five-day “Seeing Deeper: Opening Space for Expression? program. Thousands of chairs were removed for the program, leaving the empty nave as a perfect spot for picnickers to kick back. The problem, witnesses and council members said Thursday, is that there is no clear timetable for the notices, which means that a property owner can maintain poor living conditions for months, potentially compelling tenants to move out, after winning winning city approval for a development development plan. The fewer tenants left at the time that TOPA notices “We need to understand that thus kind of situation looms in many buildings, and we really need to get on that. ” D.C. Council member Anita Bonds arrive, the less likely it is that a move to purchase will be successful, successful, they said. Caroline Hennessy, who testified testified on behalf of Housing Counseling Counseling Services, which has also worked with Congress Heights tenants, suggested that the approval approval of a development by the city’s Zoning Commission should be a trigger to issue TOPA notices. That would have meant that Congress Congress Heights tenants would have received TOPA notices in early 2015, after the plan for their buildNIKKI buildNIKKI KAHN/THE WASHINGTON POST ings’ demolition won city approval. Geoffrey Griffis of City Partners, Sanford Capital’s development partner, said in an email Friday that tenants’ TOPA rights have been preserved and that “no resident resident will be permanently displaced, displaced, or driven out of Congress Heights because of this project.” But developers, Hennessy said, should “not have the ability to just wait out the tenants and make their lives miserable.” The city has also functioned as an enabler, advocates argued. Many of Sanford Capital’s tenants tenants receive Section 8 housing vouchers and other government subsidies that cover the cost of rent. That includes 170 tenants who are also “homeless services clients,” the District’s Department of Human Services told Merrifield last month. Three households are homeless families who live in buildings that are the subject of Racine’s lawsuit The fact that a company that has racked up dozens of code violations violations and is being sued by the city also receives government funds “just shows how ridiculous housing policy is in D.C.Merrifield D.C.Merrifield said Friday. “Instead of creating creating quality affordable housing, they are tunneling the most vulnerable vulnerable families to slumlords.” Several advocates proposed a “bad actor law.” “Landlords with an excessive number of code violations ... gressman denounced the Senate’s Senate’s lengthy delay in confirming her as Holder’s successor. “Sadly, she sustained one of the longest nominating processes processes — 166 days — that we’ve seen,” Hoyer said. “We’ve come a long way. But when somebody of the quality and the integrity and the honesty and the character of I^oretta Lynch has to wait 166 days to be confirmed as the great attorney general of the United States of America, we still have some ways to go.” In her speech, Lynch obliquely referenced the spate of deadly police shootings across the country, country, noting that the Justice Department Department is “spearheading efforts efforts to build trust between law enforcement officers and the communities we serve.” She also attacked what she PHOTOS BY OLIVER CONTRERAS FOR THE WASHINGTON POST should be banned from receiving any public monies,” said Jeremiah l^owery, a public witness at the hearing. Council member Bonds said her takeaway from the hearing on Thursday was “it’s really clear that the bad actors should not be a part of any subsidy whatsoever.” While Sanford Capital receives government funds to house poor District residents, other city agencies agencies have also facilitated its development development plan. That includes the District’s Zoning Commission, which last year approved a Congress Heights development plan submitted by Sanford Capital and CityPartners, despite existing code violations at properties that would be subject for demolition and despite testimony testimony from the tenants about hazardous hazardous living conditions. The region’s Metro transit agency agency also appears to be on the cusp of selling an acre of land to the developers, developers, even as Sanford is being sued by the city. Metro recently sought an appraisal appraisal for the tract of land above the Congress Heights Metro station, station, which sits adjacent to the four buildings and which it had agreed in 2012 to sell to the developers developers as part of the development plan. The Metro board will probably probably vote on the purchase price in March, a board member’s spokesman spokesman said. ubigail.hauslohner@ washpoHt.com views as the divisive nature of today’s political commentary. “We’ve seen hateful rhetoric creep into our public discourse.

Martin Luther King Jr.: “We must build dikes of courage to hold back the flood of fear.” “He knew — as we have to know — that there were no guarantees,” Lynch said, “except the guarantee that nothing would change if he did not act.

[My boyfriend’s] mom died last fall. I did what you advised, I was there for him and supportive of him regardless of what we defined what “us” was. Thinking back now, I was drained and just wanted a break. After his mom died, a huge burden was lifted off of him, and in turn, lifted off me — and he started getting support from friends, family and therapists, so I’m not his only support now. It also didn’t help that everything that we did revolved around the care of his mother. We started doing couple things again. We’ve been able to reconnect now that the burden has been lifted and I’m realizing why I had fallen in love with him in the first place. We’re learning how to support each other in a crisis. We’ve learned that it is very important to take the time to forget about whatever the crisis is and just be a couple. I think that if we had made that a priority, he and I would not have felt as stressed as we did. Any other suggestions for a crisis like the one we’ve just gone through?

427,1934813726,"FIVE MYTHS Gentrification By l-aiur Fm?iiiiin Everything about gentrification is controversial — even its definition. One recent study by sociologist Michael Barton compared how the New York Times and researchers used the term to talk about city neighborhoods; he found very little agreement about where change was happening. That?s not the only thing we can?t agree on. Gentrification is painted alternately alternately as a destroyer of neighborhoods or a savior of cities. These competing views are driven in part bv misconceptons misconceptons about what the word means and what it entails. Here are some of the most common. 1 Gentrification leads to lower crime. Over the past decade, urban crime rates have dropped precipitously. City-watchers often point to gentrification. gentrification. A letter to the editor in the New Orleans Times-Picayune called “a city getting safer” one of the “chief byproducts of gentrification.” A Mic article attributed a 30 percent crime drop in one Brooklyn neighborhood neighborhood to the phenomenon. The logic is simple: Poorer neighborhoods tend to have more crime. Gentrification, which brings an influx of wealthier residents, should lower the crime rate. In fact studies of the relationship between crime and gentrification have found the opposite: opposite: Gentrification often leads to increases in crime. One study found that larceny and robbery went up in gentrifying neighborhoods neighborhoods across the country. There are at least two explanations for this pattern. The new, wealthier residents might be more lucrative targets for would-be burglars burglars and robbers, perhaps enticing them to engage in more illegal acts. And crime thrives on instability, anonymity and weaker social ties, all of which make it easier for criminals to blend in and less likely for neighbors to look out for one another. Gentrification, by definition, definition, destabilizes a neighborhood. 2 Gentrification causes widespread displacement. For many, gentrification is synonymous synonymous with the expulsion of low-income low-income residents. As urbanist Richard Florida wrote in CityLab, “Displacement can be and is a big issue in places where gentrification gentrification is occurring at a feverish pace.? The Charlotte Observer warned that “gentrification “gentrification may be complicated, but it’s not a myth and neither is displacement.? Of course, when neighborhoods change, some families do get pushed out. But my research shows that longtime residents aren’t more likely to move when their neighborhood gentrifies; sometimes they’re actually less likely to leave (in part because of the improvements improvements gentrification can bring). In one study, I found that the probability that a household would be displaced in a gentrifying neighborhood neighborhood in New York was 1.3 percent. A 2015 study in Philadelphia found something similar similar - that neighborhood income gains did not significantly predict household exit rates. What distinguishes gentrification is not who moves out; it’s who moves in. In a gentrifying neighborhood, new residents are more likely to be well-off. As a result, the neighborhood’s poverty makeup can shift, even if no one leaves. In 2004, I found that a neighborhood?s poverty rate could drop from 30 percent to 12 percent in a decade with minimal displacement. That’s because gentrification gentrification often leads to new construction or to investment in once-vacant properties. It’s also worth noting that the vast majority of poor neighborhoods across the country aren’t gentrifying. Outside of hot metro areas such as New York, Washington and San Francisco, most poor places stay poor. 3 Longtime residents hate gentrification. gentrification. Gentrification has a decidedly negative connotation, often painted as a loss for a neighborhood’s “oldtimers.” “oldtimers.” This idea is amplified by the press. An In These Times magazine article about gentrification gentrification in the Big Easy claimed that “when native New Orleanians talk, the topic inevitably inevitably turns to conflicts with the new migrants.” In a story about a proposed apartment building building in Washington, Bloomberg Views columnist columnist Megan McArdle wrote that “longtime residents were vehemently opposed on the grounds that this would cause gentrification.” New York Daily News columnist Josh Greenman Greenman describes this as a “we-were-here-first” attitude. Of course, some people don’t want to see their neighborhoods change. But often, residents residents appreciate certain aspects of gentrification. gentrification. Homeowners stand to gain a windfall as the value of their property appreciates. Increased Increased retail activity brings more goods and services to once-forlom areas. With gentrification, gentrification, residents may no longer find it necessary to travel outside their neighborhood to have a sit-down meal or avail themselves of fresh produce. Whether residents appreciate the changes comes down to two things: the amenities in their neighborhood prior to gentrification, and whether the new services benefit the people who live there. In neighborhoods with severe disinvestment, lacking many retail services services that most people take for granted, one may find long-term residents who appreciate gentrification. As the Washington City Paper wrote about the District, “Most longtime residents of low-income neighborhoods don’t clamor for ‘gentrification,’ exactly, but they do want the things it often brings: grocery stores and other retail within walking distance; better transit connections; reduced crime; and attention from the city government.? 4 Gentriflers are white. The stereotypical image of a gentrifier gentrifier is a bearded white guy on a fixie or a young white professional who treats her dog like a spoiled child. One D.C. resident protested white gentrifiers in his neighborhood with lawn signs. Spike Lee has also talked about the phenomenon in explicitly racial tones, asking, asking, “Why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the south Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better?” As the website Gizmodo put it, “Across the United States, white infill is associated with gentrification.? But gentrification is hardly a white thing. In many neighborhoods, middle-class Asians, blacks and latinos are part and parcel of the process. Millennials and young professionals of all races appreciate the attractions and conveniences of city living. In a 2009 study, I found that gentrifying neighborhoods are more racially diverse than non-gentrifying ones. There’s another reason for this, too. Kesha Moore of Drew University has shown that professionals are drawn to some low-income minority neighborhoods because of a desire to give back to the communities where they or their parents grew up. In minority neighborhoods neighborhoods that are gentrifying, nonwhite gentrifiers gentrifiers aren’t as noticeable as white ones And even when we do notice them, we don’t call them gentrifiers. 5 Gentrification happens naturally.? When we talk about a gentrified neighborhood, we may imagine something specific — a bustling street with new coffee shops, boutique boutique clothing stores and artisanal breweries. Gentrification “probably does mean getting a Starbucks or another upscale cafe,” Gizmodo wrote. In fact, the coffee chain is so synonymous synonymous with the phenomenon that the Guardian Guardian asked: “In gentrified cities which came first: Starbucks or higher real estate prices?? It’s true that a lot of gentrifying neighborhoods neighborhoods get these amenities. But it’s not inevitable. inevitable. As sociologist Sylvie Tissot has shown, gentrifiers don’t rely on market forces alone to bring in the types of restaurants and shops compatible with a neighborhood’s new image. The same gentrifiers who are drawn to a low-income neighborhood for cheaper housing housing might also work to change the area more to their liking. This might mean leaning on police and code enforcers to drive out seedy bars, or pushing policymakers to provide subsidies to businesses that “fit in.?Tb be sure, market forces help change commerce in gentrifying gentrifying neighborhoods. But often lurking behind the “invisible hand” are activists and policymakers who wish to nudge the market to produce certain outcomes. Sometimes, the poor try to use these same levers to change their neighborhoods. Consider Consider Harlem, where residents in the 1970s sought to stabilize their community by luring middle-class homeowners and retail. Their successes may have paved the way for outsiders outsiders to invest, move in and spur gentrification. But change began long before the demographic demographic shift. outlook wash post com Lance Freeman is an urban-planning professor at Columbia University and the author of ?There Goes the Hood: Views of Gentrification f rom the Ground Up.?

463,1935081371,"KATHLEEN PARKER Democrats must save themselves JACKSONVILLE, ALA. I f the Democratic Party is ailing after losing the presidency to Donald IYump, state parties are on life support. Here in the long-ago Democratic stronghold of Alabama, the party is all but dead, say some of its disheartened disheartened members. Consider: Not a single single statewide office is held by a Democrat; the state legislature is dominated by Republicans with just 33 Democrats out of 105 House seats and eight of 35 Senate seats. Democrats haven’t won a U.S. Senate election in the state since 1992 or the governorship since 1998. There are no Democratic appellate judges, nor any Democratic members members of the state’s Public Service Commission. Democrats also are becoming becoming scarcer in county offices. “The Democratic Party in Alabama Alabama is on a crash-and-burn track unless something drastic happens to stop this runaway train,” said Sheila Gilbert, chair of the Calhoun County Democrats, who hand-delivered a letter outlining the party’s problems following a speech I gave at Jacksonville Jacksonville State University as the Ayers lecturer. The letter was signed by Gilbert as a leader of the Alabama Democratic Reform Caucus (ADRC) and 17 other members in attendance. The group, which formed two years ago to try to help revive the state party, wasn’t coy about its reason for approaching me. “We need a spotlight on Alabama and some outside effort to avoid becoming a totally one-party state,” Gilbert said. 1 didn’t bother to mention that the current U.S. attorney general, former former Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, was shining quite a spotlight on their home state. Whether Sessions is forced to resign after already recusing himself from investigations investigations related to the 2016 election campaign, including Russia’s possible possible role, remains to be seen. The fall of such a high-profile Republican could be useful to Democrats back home trying to defibrillate the party. But Gilbert’s group has been critical critical of state Democratic Party officials officials for missing an opportunity to recruit candidates when other Republican Republican politicians were in trouble, including the governor and House speaker. A recent meeting of county and state party leaders reportedly became heated when state Chairwoman Chairwoman Nancy Worley offered to call police to escort one county chairman from the room — and may be emblematic emblematic more broadly of the party’s disintegration from within. The GOP went through this same sort of infighting and navel-gazing on the national level several years back. After losing the presidency to Barack Obama in 2008, it regrouped, reformed itself and became disciplined. disciplined. Now it has taken the House, Senate, White House and most of the nation’s governorships, while also successfully gerrymandering congressional congressional districts that have given Republicans the advantage in many states — at least until the next redistricting after the 2020 Census. Democrats are readying themselves themselves for that fight, but they’ll need to do more than try to redraw the map. While Democrats were basking in Obama’s sunny smile, Republicans Republicans were busy building benches of future leaders, especially at the state attorney general level, where they are now in the majority. The strategy has been to recruit and help elect strong attorneys general who could be groomed to become governors, senators — and possibly presidents. What, meanwhile, can Democrats do, a fellow in the audience asked me. There was a plaintive tone in his voice and I wanted to help, though the truth is, I’m not accustomed to Democrats asking my advice. But in the spirit of “it takes two to tango” — and the fact that I’d rather not live in a country exclusively run by either party — I’ll give it a fresh, morningafter morningafter stab. What’s really ailing Democrats is they’ve fallen in love with abstract principles, as reflected on an ADRC handout, without building a foundation foundation where such goals as fair pay, transparency, diversity and such can be played out. TYump may have been coarse and loose at times during the campaign, but he spoke in plain language with plain meaning: jobs, jobs, jobs. Whether IYump could fix trade, create jobs and make money for the rest of us was a gamble people were willing to take. Fixing the economy was Obama’s mandate, too, but he decided to focus on health care instead. This is where lust for legacy interferes with good governance. Obama did manage to help turn the economic steamship around — the market bounced from just under 8,000 when he took office to nearly 20,000 — but Wall Street’s recovery didn’t trickle down to the middle class, where TYump planted his flag. When in doubt, look to the victor. kathleenparker@washpost. com ALEX BRANDON.?ASSOCIATED PRESS Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) testifies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January. Sessions shouldn’t gel a free pass by Philip Lacovara and Lawrence Robbins A ttorney General Jeff Sessions made a seemingly false statement statement under oath during his confirmation hearing. Admittedly, Admittedly, not every potential perjury case gets prosecuted, and Sessions may well have defenses to such a charge. But as lawyers at the Justice Department and attorneys in private practice who have represented individuals accused in such cases, we can state with assurance: Federal Federal prosecutors have brought charges in cases involving far more trivial misstatements misstatements and situations far less consequential consequential than whether a nominee to be the nation’s chief law enforcement officer officer misled fellow senators during his confirmation hearings. Sessions’s problematic statement involves involves his response to a question by Sen. A1 Franken (D-Minn.) about what he would do as attorney general “if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.” Sessions said he was unaware of any such activities, then volunteered, “1 did not have communications communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.” In fact, thenSen. thenSen. Sessions (R-Ala.), a top ?IYump campaign campaign adviser, met at least twice during the presidential campaign with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, The Post revealed. As any number of witnesses have learned the hard way, it is a federal felony to lie to Congress. Under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Sections 1001 and 1621, perjury before Congress is punishable by up to five years imprisonment. To prove that offense, a prosecutor would have to establish that Sessions’s answer was false, that he knew it was false when made and that the subject matter of the answer was “material” to the congressional congressional inquiry in which he was testifying. testifying. Those elements all appear to be present. present. The element of falsity is established established by the conceded fact that he did “have communications with the Russians” Russians” during the TYump campaign. And there can scarcely be any doubt that the subject matter of Sessions’s answer was highly material to the Senate’s consideration consideration of his nomination. Any suggestion that he participated in the suspected interaction between IYump campaign ANNE APPLEBAUM Can the alt-right be stopped in France? T he issues under debate in this year’s French presidential election are broad and varied: terrorism and trade, the retirement age and social security, the legacy of France in Algeria and the future of France in Europe. But in truth, only one issue really matters: Can the heady cocktail of fear-mongering, nationalism, nostalgia, resentment, pro-Russian foreign policy and big-govemment economics — a philosophy that is described, unsatisfyingly, unsatisfyingly, as “far right” or “populist,” that takes a particularly virulent online form and that has contributed to recent electoral victories in the United States and Britain — be defeated in a major Western country? And if so, how? At least until scandal began to damage his campaign, Francois Fillon, the candidate candidate of the center-right Republican party, offered what looked like the safest formula: steal the populist issues from the “far right” — Marine Le Pen’s National Front — and make them mainstream. In choosing this strategy, he was emulating Theresa May, the conservative British prime minister who has defeated the upstart U.K. Independence Independence Party by announcing she will leave all European trade structures (as UKIP would have done) and make immigration immigration control her priority (as UKJP does already). Fillon’s version is slightly different — he has called for a halt to immigration from outside Europe, tougher borders and tougher language on assimilation of French Muslims — but the idea is the same. Like I jc Pen, whose campaign has been funded with personnel and the Russian government was, and remains, a matter of grave concern. That leaves one element: Did Sessions know that his answer w?as false? He says no, asserting that he understood Franken Franken to be asking only whether he had contact with the Russian government in his capacity as a TYump campaign surrogate. surrogate. While a jury might accept that defense, there are many reasons to reject it: Sessions’s answer baldly denied any contact. Moreover, Sessions went out of his way to deny contact in response to a question that did not inquire about that subject. By doing so, he preempted an important line of inquiry that might otherwise have been fruitftilly pursued. Certainly there is precedent for a prosecution in this context. Part of the fallout from Watergate included the special special prosecutor’s investigation of Richard Richard Kleindienst, who had resigned from his position as attorney general, for alleged false statements during his confirmation confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Judiciary Committee. Kleindienst was asked whether the White House had interfered with a Justice Department antitrust action against the International International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Corporation. He stated, “I was not interfered with by anybody at the White House” — but President Nixon and one of his top aides had each called Kleindienst regarding regarding the case. Kleindienst pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for “reftisfing] “reftisfing] and fail[ing] to answer accurately accurately and fully” questions at a congressional congressional hearing. Those facts left no room for any colorable defense on the “knowledge” issue. But when Justice Department officials decide whether to bring a case against Sessions — or, more appropriately, appropriately, when an independent counsel is appointed and resolves that question — this must be done against the backdrop of other peijury cases that the department department has chosen over the years to bring. And the department has prosecuted individuals who advanced defenses very similar to Sessions’s arguments here, often where there was far less at stake. Years ago, for example, one of us (Robbins) represented a defendant named John Patrick Dowd, accused of lying to a grand jury. Dowd was president president of a company that had leased a vessel that had dumped 13,500 tons of Philadelphia incinerator ash into the sea. There was no evidence that Dowd Russian money, he speaks of friendship with Russia. He talks openly about his Catholicism in a bid to lure France’s “family values” voters away from Le Pen, too. But alas, it seems that Fillon’s version of family values included putting his wife and sons on the state payroll, a story that just won’t go away. That leaves the contest in the hands of Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old social and economic liberal whose strategy is quite different. It’s been clear for some time that the old left-right split in European politics doesn’t reflect real social divisions, and that the new fault lines are better described as “integrationist” vs. “nationalist,” “nationalist,” or, more bluntly, “open” vs. “closed.” But although the “closed? voices — parties such as Le Pen’s National Front or UKIP - are long established. Macron is the first major European politician to attract mass support by putting up a vigorous, active and angry defense of “open.” “I defend Europe,” he told a British journalist. “If you are shy, you are dead.? His strategy, so far, has been built on defiance of ideological stereotypes. Macron has a background in banking but speaks about “collective solidarity.? He served as a minister in a Socialist government but has said that “honesty compels me to say that I am not a socialist.” Instead of a traditional political party he has his own movement, En Marche — a rough translation might be “Forward” — that he launched, to widespread widespread skepticism, in 2016. He has invited U.S. scientists, especially those working on climate change and clean energy, to come was personally involved in the dumping, but his grand jury testimony led to a perjury indictment. Dowd was acquitted acquitted of lying to the grand jury when he testified that he didn’t know where the ash went. Yet he was convicted for his negative response to the question: “You had no idea?” Thus, even a question and answer far vaguer and more ambiguous than the Franken-Sessions exchange were deemed sufficient to justify prosecution. prosecution. Or take the classic case of vague questioning: Bronston v. United States. Samuel Bronston had placed his movie production company into bankruptcy and was being questioned about his and the company?s finances. He was asked about, and denied, having any accounts in Swiss banks. Then the obvious followup followup — “Have you ever?” — to which Bronston replied: “The company had an account there for about six months.” What Bronston neglected to mention was that he had a large personal Swiss bank account that he closed when he filed to place his company in bankruptcy. bankruptcy. The Supreme Court held that although although his responses may have been deceptive and intended to mislead, they did not constitute peijury because they were literally true, and it was the fault of the questioner that he failed to pursue the inquiry further. The Sessions’s situation situation presents exactly the opposite scenario: scenario: Sessions’s response appears to be both literally false and comprehensive, leaving nothing open for further inquiry regarding the nature of his contacts with the Russian government during the presidential campaign. A government that has been willing to prosecute relatively small and questionable questionable instances of falsity in connection with matters of comparatively minor importance should have difficulty explaining explaining why Sessions’s testimony would receive a free pass. Philip Lacovara was counsel to Watergate special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski, and also served as deputy U.S. solicitor general responsible for criminal matters, including the Bronston case. Lawrence Robbins has been both an assistant U.S. attorney and assistant to the solicitor general. Lacovara is a lifelong Republican; Robbins contributed to and raised money for Hillary Clinton?s presidential campaign. The views expressed are their own. live in France. He wants to roll out the red carpet for British academics and businessmen businessmen marginalized by May’s retreat from Europe, too. He also attracts enemies. Because his victory would strengthen both the European European Union and NATO, Macron’s campaign has naturally attracted the attention of those who want to destroy them. Both WikiLeaks (which claims to have “secret documents” on all the candidates) and the Russian propaganda channel RT have attempted attempted to show sinister links between Macron and Hillary Clinton. The predictable predictable whispering campaign is conspiratorial (“Macron is part of a secret cabal”), anti-Semitic anti-Semitic (“Macron works for the Rothschilds”) and personal (“Macron is gay”). That kind of negative campaigning — based on slurs and hysterical allegations — has worked brilliantly in other countries, and there is plenty of time left for it to succeed in France. Macron’s success will depend on whether he can withstand the coming smear campaign, campaign, and then pull off a trick that has so far eluded his British, Dutch and other counterparts: Unite the center-left and the center-right behind a single banner, and run a campaign that is patriotic as well as “open,” tough on terrorism as well as “integrationist.” “integrationist.” The stakes are high. If he loses, muscular liberalism will disappear from France for a generation. But if he wins, he will have many eager imitators, not only in France but also across the continent and around the world. applebaumletters (d? wash post, com GEORGE F.

There is, however, a more recent and pertinent presentation of a grim future. Last year, in her 13th novel, “The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047,” Lionel Shriver imagined America slouching into dystopia merely by continuing continuing current practices. Shriver, who is fascinated by the susceptibility of complex systems to catastrophic collapses, begins her story story after the 2029 economic crash and the Great Renunciation, whereby the nation, like a dissolute Atlas, shrugged off its national debt, saying to creditors: creditors: It’s nothing personal.

This punishes those “who had a conscientious, caretaking relationship to the future.” Government salaries and Medicare reimbursements are “linked to an inflation algorithm that didn’t require further action from Congress. Even if a Snickers bar eventually eventually cost $5 billion, they were safe.” In a Reason magazine interview, Shriver says, “I think it is in the nature of government to infinitely expand until it eats its young.” In her novel, she writes: “The state starts moving money around. A little fairness here, little more fairness there. ... Eventually social democracies all arrive at the same tipping point: where half the country depends on the other half.... Government becomes a pricey, clumsy, inefficient mechanism for transferring wealth from people who do something to people who don’t, and from the young to the old — which is the wrong direction. All that effort, and you’ve only managed a new unfairness.” Florence learns to appreciate “the miracle of civilization.” It is miraculous miraculous because “failure and decay were the world’s natural state.

What do you do now?” Stephen Wright, an architect who works just south of Dave Thomas Circle, in NoMa, and tries to avoid it at all costs JAHI CHIKWENDIU/THE WASHINGTON POSTTOP Before it was turned into a virtual circle, the intersection, seen from atop the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was ranked the District’s seventh most-accidentprone most-accidentprone in a study from 2006. Since then, traffic-related injuries have declined, but crashes have gone up. Where Pierre and Dave collide, a traffic nightmare CIRCLE FROM Cl W e don’t think Pierre L’Enfant was drunk in 1791 when he plotted Washington as a grid of streets, shot through with diagonal avenues. But he stopped the grid at the cliffs and hills that surrounded the central city — and that left a dangling diagonal over on the northeastern flank, unnamed and unfinished. By 1861, city planners planners had given it the default name of Boundary Street. So as east-west O Street and north-south First Street reached the terminus of Boundary Street, in accordance with L’Enfant’s plan, an orphaned triangle of land was born. “It feels like he just gave up,” says Scott W. Berg, author of the L’Enfant biography “Grand Avenues: The Story of the French Visionary Who Designed Washington, D.C.” “There’s a lot of intersections in his plan, but along the edges there’s all kinds of super-weird places in D.C. ... To make some intersections beautiful and significant, other intersections intersections will just have to be left over. This is the result.” For years it remained an untamed untamed place where cascading creeks collided and burrowed underground. underground. Then in 1878, as Washington Washington began to sprawl into a metropolis, metropolis, a man named Michael Esch was issued a building permit for a twostory twostory brick dwelling on the triangle, now known as Square 709. Boundary Boundary Street was renamed Florida Avenue in 1890, after landowners complained that the original name sounded too sinister. Esch opened a florist’s shop, and by 1904 an electric electric trolley line and a railroad track had converged mere feet from the property, to serve the outposts of Eckington and Bladensburg. Already, Already, the intersection had become busy and dangerous, a place to pass through, or around. The brick building became a station station for the Washington Railway and Electric Co. when it decided in 1908 to soften a dangerous curve by rerouting its lines through the triangle. triangle. But as the steam engine gave way to the motorcar in the 1920s, the building found another new life: Thomas J. Crowell’s fuel and auto body shop. A wash and polish cost $2.50. By 1949 it was a Texaco station that had a pinball machine inside. It was the ongoing story of America, America, in a triangle of misbegotten land: a place between present and future, downtown and out-of-town, between between where you are vs. where you want to be. Flowers gave way to railroads, gas gave way to fast food.

With the gentrification of Eckington to the north, the opening of Union Market to the east and the rise of NOMA to the south, the area around Dave Thomas Circle has become as much a destination as a place to pass through.

That same year, the National National Capital Planning Commission suggested Wendy’s be replaced with a proper monument — to someone other than Dave Thomas. None of this happened. In 2010 the District Department of Transportation Transportation rejiggered the triangle into the traffic roundabout that exists today, making the Wendy’s even more of a focal point. “It’s about time D.C. honored one of our nation’s greatest heroes,” wrote a commenter on Greater Greater Washington at the time. “Where’s the beef? It’s right here.” With this new traffic pattern, the number of traffic-related injuries went down but the number of crashes crashes went up. As did congestion and confusion. “I can’t remember what the last iteration of the circle was,” says neighborhood commissioner Heather Edehnan, whose district abuts New York. “God, I know it sucked. But then I almost feel like this one sucks worse.” “It’s sort of everybody’s favorite thing to hate,” acknowledges Sam Zimbabwe, chief project delivery officer for DDOT. Still, “I think the virtual circle design is a lot more straightforward, and safer overall, for pedestrians.” Over 70,000 vehicles navigate the circle each weekday: Penske trucks, cement mixers, school buses, a helpless helpless gray Porsche marooned by illtimed illtimed traffic lights in the middle of New York and First. McKinley High School students skitter across it from the NoMa Metro stop. Pedestrians sometimes pause to watch a particularly harrowing harrowing traffic situation play out. Panhandlers frogger their way between between cars, taking advantage of red lights that last up to 90 seconds. The drama on the road is countered countered by the banality of surroundings: surroundings: the homely butt of the vaguely named Department of Human Services, Services, the glower of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Explosives, whose curving, 30-foot-tall concrete barrier gives a cold shoulder shoulder to the circle.

Most of the action comes through the drivethrough. drivethrough. A cheerful employee named Crystal goes table to table asking patrons if they’d like water. The TVs play muted ESPN. Comcast technicians, traffic cops and other solo lunchers silently study their french fries and phones as if they’re in a library. A middle-aged white man and a black teenager pool their pocket change to buy a homeless man a Dr Pepper. ‘Worst intersection I can think of,” says D.C. Water employee John Cox after finishing lunch in the eye of the storm. Wendy’s has been the intersection’s intersection’s one constant over the past 33 years. Today the franchise is owned by NPC Quality Burgers Inc. The land, worth $5 million, has been owned since 2006 by the Bernstein Management Corp. It’s “a high-volume restaurant” and “an important location,” says Wendy’s spokeswoman Heidi Schauer. Some neighborhood politicians and business developers want it gone. “Almost anyone I know is like, ‘Eminent-domain that sucker and move on,”’ says one local elected official who was granted anonymity to speak bluntly. “This is not difficult.” difficult.” In April, the Department of Transportation unveiled five new concepts for the next fix, which would install more green space and pedestrian-friendly passages. Some would directly join Eckington Place to First Street NE, currently separated separated by a severe dogleg around the Wendy’s parking lot. Two of the concepts involve demolishing the Wendy’s. But choosing, funding and implementing implementing one of them would happen years down the road, if at all — and alterations to streets within L’Enfant’s L’Enfant’s original plan require special review. Says the Wendy’s spokeswoman: ‘We look forward to successfully operating here for many years to come.” There you have it. Pierre L’Enfant drew a triangle 226 years ago and now we’re stuck with a fast-food outlet in the middle of a major intersection, and a problem that may never be solved.

For the hundreds of people who came Saturday, and millions of others over the decades, Barry was a hero, and his actions during his years in office — beginning with his election as mayor in 1978 — were heroic. The majority-black city went from a federal protectorate to independence, independence, and the region became became home to a large African American middle class. And to residents who felt powerless, powerless, literally overseen by the ruling elite in federal Washington, Washington, Barry was their knight in a black fedora. “Sometime after Martin Luther Luther King had a dream, and before Barack Obama brought us hope, it was Marion Barry who brought opportunity to Washington, Washington, D.C.,” Mayor Muriel E. Bowser Bowser (D) told the crowd. “Marion Barry was bigger than life. He taught us that as long as you’re waking up on this Earth, there can be a comeback.” The block of Pennsylvania Avenue Avenue at 13V2 Street NW — where the waving and smiling bronzed resemblance of him now stands — was transformed into a scene of black-power activists with signs, petitions and T-shirts for sale. Nation of Islam members selling newspapers mingled with men in African garb and sanitation sanitation workers in orange suits with reflective strips. Reparations advocates advocates crisscrossed with clipboard-wielding clipboard-wielding residents seeking seeking signatures for their candidates. candidates. A gospel choir sang, and when soft piano music was played, someone in the crowd yelled: “Where’s the funk music?” music?” All 13 members of the D.C. Council attended, as well as the District’s nonvoting member of the House of Representatives, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), and many other present and past city leaders. “Those who loved him took criticism of him personally because because they identified with him,” Norton said to cheers, “and his struggles,” she added to more. The piece, by Washington area sculptor Steven Weitzman, will be one of three full-body statues in the city of African Americans, according to Bowser’s office. Weitzman is white, a fact that initially jarred Barry’s widow, Cora Masters Barry, because the late mayor spent much of his life focused on black empowerment, starting with his years as a civil rights activist in the 1960s. But after meeting with Weitzman, she changed her mind. While Barry was a celebrity during his lifetime and still is in death — he was selected in 2007 by a majority of District residents residents and tourists to debut in the opening of the city’s Madame Tussaud’s wax museum — his municipal legacy is still being written. In 2015, Bowser named a summer summer jobs program after Barry, and a gravestone monument was unveiled in 2016 at Congressional Congressional Cemetery in Southeast Washington.

Whether you liked him or hated him.” Musgrove said that, for some, Barry has become more beloved since he and his years of power passed. “Lots of middle-class black folks who criticized him before, now that the city’s gentrifying, he symbolizes something he couldn’t 20 years ago,” Musgrove said. “He symbolizes black power politics. He symbolizes ‘Chocolate ‘Chocolate City,’ that era.” John Cheeks, who heads a group that seeks compensation for descendants of slave owners and of slaves, said while Barry had shortcomings, “he wanted to lift people from poverty, so that’s why people here hail him as a hero.” “You’d hear your parents talking talking about how he helped them with things here and there,” said Cheeks, who was in the crowd for the unveiling. “He was an underdog, underdog, and being African Amerineighbor.

Susan Meehan, a published poet and longtime city activist who worked for Mayor Marion Barry, said she used to sing in Gaelic to it. “What a beautiful tree it was,” went the tune. She was even arrested at the foot of the tree, protesting development, she said. Winds wrested the trunk from its venerable roots in Washington soil around 9 p.m. Friday. “To me [the sound] seemed like a scream because it had a twisting flavor to it,” she said. “It seemed like the tree was saying, ‘This is my death.’” Well, you can do a eulogy,” Bob Meehan said to his wife over their A crowd gathers on a windy, sunny afternoon to pose before — and take photos of — the eight-foot-tall bronze statue by Washington-area sculptor Steven Weitzman. cans, we are all here due to slavery and can relate to that.” The feelings Barry stirs up at the highest levels were on display display earlier this week, when WAMU reported that former D.C. mayor Anthony Williams, whom many credit or blame — depending depending on perspective — with the gentrification of the city, told a public audience at George Washington Washington University: “The man flew the city into the side of a mountain and he gets a statue. I SALWAN GEORGES/THE WASHINGTON POST The historic Jackson elm tree was taken down by strong winds Friday. “It created its own little atmosphere right there in the middle of the alley,” said Holly Van Fleet, 74. rebuilt the city — come on.” On Saturday, Williams agreed that Barry should have a statue, but he expressed frustration that, despite all his flaws, the former mayor continues to dominate dominate the city’s landscape in such an outsize way. “He deserves one because of his work in civil rights. He stood for the reversal of 60 years of discrimination at the federal level level and at the city level ... and stood for self determination for the city,” Williams said. “He wasn’t a saint, but Thomas Thomas Jefferson wasn’t, John F. Kennedy Kennedy wasn’t. We’re not deifying him, we’re honoring him for what he stood for,” he said. “But 20 years from now, he’ll still be a controversial figure.” Barry said that he was inspired inspired by his mother’s struggles in the segregated South. He became became an activist for civil rights as a teen, and was elected as the first chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Committee in his 20s. At Saturday’s event, a screen honoring Barry’s life quoted civil rights figure Andrew Young saying saying Barry “was the first to bring the movement into the politics of Washington, D.C.” The District’s many new residents residents are just beginning to learn about and interpret Barry’s legacy legacy for themselves. Michael Bekesha, a Republican Republican attorney running for the D.C. Council in Ward 6, published an opinion piece this week saying that Barry’s treatment of women should disqualify anyone in the #MeToo era. “I don’t disagree he made great contributions. However, a statue is not the best way to honor an individual with such a complex history,” Bekesha said in an interview. “Renaming summer summer youth employment or renaming renaming a building on U Street would be appropriate. The problem problem with statues is you’re highlighting highlighting the individual. Not the individual’s achievements and contributions.” Among the overwhelmingly black crowd at the Wilson Building Building were some people of other backgrounds. Among them was Frank Fritz, 23, who at first hesitated to speak because he felt the day belonged to African Americans. “A lot of newer faces in D.C. don’t respect him, and we need to learn about him,” said Fritz, a Filipino American who came to the District for college and has since moved to Silver Spring. michelle. hoorstein @ washpost.com kitchen island as sunlight streamed through the window. “I think I will,” she said.

29,2060847776,"E ven after the deadly riots m Detroit Detroit and Newark, and smaller disturbances in dozens of other American cities during the “long, hot summer of 1967,” many Washingtonians thought that kind of trouble couldn’t happen here. And the local news media reflected that complacency. complacency. There had been relatively little exploration exploration of what life was really like in Washington’s Washington’s lower-income black communities after after what were reported to be isolated instances of unrest, including confrontations confrontations between black residents and the police. In one of the most troubling occurrences, occurrences, spectators at the 1962 Thanksgiving Day “Turkey Bowl” began fighting at the end of the championship football game between Eastern High, an all-black public school team, and the nearly all-white team from the private school St. John’s College High. Eventually the fight would spill from D.C. Stadium, which was renamed RFK Stadium in 1969, into the surrounding neighborhood and injure several hundred people. In 1967, amid rumors of coming trouble in some parts of the city, shop windows were smashed and stores looted along H Street NE in a quickly contained disturbance disturbance after a rock concert at the old Washington Washington Coliseum. Meanwhile, much of The Washington Post’s local reporting was focused on efforts efforts to reform the governance of a city of an estimated 850,000 people — two-thirds of them African Americans (“Negroes” in the media language of the time) — who had no voice in their local government or law enforcement. President Lyndon Johnson, with the grudging acquiescence of Congress, replaced replaced the federally controlled three-commissioner three-commissioner District government in late 1967 with a presidentially appointed black mayor, Walter E. Washington, and an appointed appointed black-majority city council. The Johnson administration also installed police police reformer Patrick V. Murphy as director of public safety for Washington, with the mandate of improving relations between the predominantly white police force and the black community. Ben W. Gilbert, then The Post’s deputy managing editor, who had long overseen the newspaper’s local news coverage, was a close friend of Mayor Washington and an active advocate of the fledgling home rule experiment. He was also involved in behind-the-scenes behind-the-scenes efforts by local leaders and federal officials to avoid the riots that so many other racially divided cities had experienced during the 1960s. As a result, Gilbert sometimes played down stories in The Post about clashes between police and black residents that he feared could lead to more serious trouble. Before the change in the city’s government, government, then-Post reporter Robert G. Kaiser wrote a story in April 1967 about a secret meeting of the three D.C. commissioners to investigate the late-night arrest of a young leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Marion Barry. Police had stopped Barry after midnight midnight for jaywalking and arrested him after an exchange of words. The commissioners commissioners and community leaders were concerned concerned about reports that angry African Americans were gathering at the SNCC offices on 14 th Street NW and threatening to riot in protest. After Barry was released, he met with and calmed down his supporters. supporters. Gilbert opposed putting Kaiser’s exclusive exclusive story on The Post’s front page. But he was overruled by Ben Bradlee, then The Post’s relatively new executive editor. “Everyone “Everyone in the newsroom knew about it,” recalled Kaiser, who later became The Post’s managing editor. It marked a turning turning point in the newspaper’s handling of such coverage. In November 1967, Kaiser and fellow local reporter Carl Bernstein wrote afrontpage afrontpage story aboutMayor Washington, in his first full day on the job, working with aides to “cool” an angry crowd of 300 Pride Inc. workers and followers who were marching marching to the White House in protest of a threat to Pride’s federal funding. Barry, with others, had started Pride with a Labor Department grant for job training for unemployed unemployed young black people in Washington. Washington. The mayor instructed police to be sympathetic with the marchers, and then he met with them and Barry at a local junior high school. At the same time, federal and District officials were privately working on a contingency contingency plan — called “Cabin Guard” — for how local police and federal troops could respond to major rioting in Washington Washington with less loss of life and property than there had been in other cities. They were particularly concerned about the Poor People’s Campaign march and encampment encampment that Martin Luther King Jr. planned for Washington in the summer of 1968. The Cabin Guard plan identified elite military units well-trained in riot-control techniques that could be moved quickly onto the streets of the capital. They were racially integrated and had black soldiers in key command positions. The military’s nearby 3rd Infantry Regiment at Fort Myer and the 91st Engineer Battalion at Fort Belvoir had protected the Pentagon during massive demonstrations against the Vietnam War in October 1967 The 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., had been commended for its restraint restraint while deployed in Detroit during the deadly 1967 riots there, in contrast to the Michigan National Guard. The 503rd Military Police Battalion at Fort Bragg had been deployed during the integration of the University of Mississippi in 1962, and for the Selma, Ala., march and demonstrations demonstrations in 1965. In February and March of 1967, officers of each of the designated military units toured the police precincts 1968 I THE D.C. RIOTS A city on fire tested military and the media Underlying rage went underreported until riots erupted by Leonard Downie Jr. in Washington where they would be deployed deployed if it became necessary. In the first hours after King’s death was announced on Thursday night, April 4, 1968, and rioting began in Washington, the D.C. police and city officials were disorganized disorganized and ineffective in their initial response. The military units were put on alert. By Friday afternoon, daylight looting and setting of fires spread rapidly along 14th and Seventh streets NW and H Street NE. Deputy Attorney General Warren Christopher and the designated “Task Force Washington” commander, Gen. Ralph E. Haines Jr., toured the city and recommended that President Johnson sign an order for what became a 12-day military occupation of the city by 13,600 federal and D.C. National Guard troops. A joint Task Force Washington command command post was set up at D.C. police headquarters, headquarters, where former undersecretary of defense Cyrus Vance worked as a federally paid consultant to Mayor Washington to help coordinate strategy, based on Vance’s similar role in Detroit in 1967. Vance brought with him a book he had prepared of lessons learned from his Detroit experience. experience. They included decisions to make liberal use of tear gas and mass arrests to subdue rioters, while sharply restricting the use of guns by police and the military. Curfews — which were imposed for six consecutive nights in Washington — were to be strictly and fairly enforced. All soldiers soldiers were given written orders on walletsize walletsize cards emphasizing courtesy and restraint restraint in the use of force. Despite the extensive looting, destruction destruction and dramatic fires that consumed what became known as the city’s “riot corridors,” there were only 13 deaths, eight of them in fires. Most of the 1,190 injuries were not serious; many were from smoke or tear gas inhalation. An estimated 20,000 people were involved in the riots, and 1,000 fires were set. More than 7,600 men, women and children were arrested. There was almost no shooting. About 100 Washington Post reporters, columnists, photographers and editors, including 14 black staff members, were mobilized to cover the rioting. Gilbert had prepared detailed instructions for everyone everyone who went out into the streets, which included: “A hand moving quickly into a pocket to pull out a [press] pass may be misunderstood. misunderstood. Thus we have designed our own pass, which can be hung around the neck for easy identification... “Our fleet model photographic cars without any ornamentation look like official official cars and can be targets. They are now being repainted two-tone and ‘unstandardized’ ‘unstandardized’ in other ways... ‘We are seeking the broadest possible perspective in our reporting of racial unrest unrest and find that interracial teams are especially valuable in riot situations.” Post reporters and photographers roamed the city, staying in touch with the newsroom from radio-equipped cars. Reporters Reporters radioed in reports of what they saw, while photographers returned periodically periodically to drop off their film. During the first week after the death ofKing, The Post published 170,000 words of articles and more than 180 photographs of the three days of riots and their aftermath. As a reporter on the local news staff, I spent some time on the street but more at the command center and the news conferences, conferences, covering the coordination of the local and federal response. It became clear to me that Christopher, Vance and Haines played key roles, although Washington, Murphy and D.C. police Chief John B. Layton were included in major decisions. In effect, the federal government was managing managing the crisis in the federal city. Weeks after the military occupation ended, I went to several of the troops’ bases to interview some of them. Capt. Leroy Rhode, commander of the 3rd Infantry’s D Company at Fort Myer, who led the first troops into Washington at 4:40 p.m. on April 5, had been a rifle platoon leader in the first Army unit sent into combat in Vietnam three years earlier. He recalled thinking, as his men set up a command center at the Capitol, “There I was, 26 years old, and with a hell of a responsibility, especially since those were fellow Americans Americans we might have to face out on the streets.” Drawing on our own research and the reporting and photography that had filled the newspaper for weeks, Gilbert, another reporter, Jesse W. Lewis Jr., and I later that year produced a Washington Post book, “Ten Blocks From the White House: Anatomy Anatomy of the Washington Riots of 1968.” Writing in August 1968, Gilbert summarized summarized at the book’s end: “The city’s five-month attempt at a dialogue dialogue — in the schools, in public meetings on rebuilding burned-out streets, in angry statements from black activists about the police — has brought out some of the problems and alienation that lay behind the rioting. “But, in August, the question remained whether the nation’s capital would be able to do an effective job of coping with the conditions that caused the riots.” While there were no more riots after 1968, that question hung over the city during a white and black middle-class migration to the suburbs, the ups and downs of evolving home rule, a siege of crack cocaine and violent crime, a federal takeover of the District’s finances, and eventual downtown redevelopment and gentrification of the former riot corridor neighborhoods in a city now half black and half white. local® washpost.com Leonard Downie Jr. is the Weil Family Professor at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and a former executive editor of The Washington Post.",3/28/2018,"('downtown', 'redevelopment', 'and')","('the', 'former', 'riot')","['” While there were no more riots after 1968, that question hung over the city during a white and black middle-class migration to the suburbs, the ups and downs of evolving home rule, a siege of crack cocaine and violent crime, a federal takeover of the District’s finances, and eventual downtown redevelopment and gentrification of the former riot corridor neighborhoods in a city now half black and half white.']", While there were no more riots after 1968 that question hung over the city during a white and black middleclass migration to the suburbs the ups and downs of evolving home rule a siege of crack cocaine and violent crime a federal takeover of the Districts finances and eventual downtown redevelopment and gentrification of the former riot corridor neighborhoods in a city now half black and half white

769,2131570133,"html> ... But it s my hodgepodge’ BLACK FROM E10 For the uninitiated, the duo rocks in all forms, moving effortlessly effortlessly from folk to prog to thrashy metal. And if the lyrics are often comic, the production itself is as thick as any radio hit. They’ve worked with Dave Grohl, Dust Brother John King, and also featured featured guests as diverse as Phish keyboardist Page McConnell and multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion. Tenacious D has also had considerable considerable commercial success. Two of their three albums cracked the Billboard Top-10. But “Post-Apocalypto” is something something different, planting Black and Gass — or their alter egos Jables and Rage Kage — into a road adventure across a landscape landscape destroyed by an atomic bomb. They encounter monsters, procreating cave women, a twoheaded twoheaded dog named Hope and assorted assorted real-world characters along the way, all of it testing their resolve to remain the greatest rock band that ever lived. Black could easily have farmed out the work in “Post-Apocalypto,” “Post-Apocalypto,” hiring illustrators to punch out his brainstorms. Instead, he did all the sketches, more than 3,000 in total, with a ballpoint pen. Spiker scanned them into his Mac so that they could be colorized. colorized. “It took forever, but I really did enjoy the process,” Black says. “In many ways, I preferred that to going to set and working on a movie. My hope is that it’ll play like ‘Beavis and Butt-Head.’Those are bad drawings, but they’re hilarious. hilarious. I secretly hope this is successful enough that I’m asked to do more drawing.” If Bobby McFerrin and Dio had a love child “Post-Apocalypto” is the perfect perfect Venn diagram for Black, bringing together his love of drawing, music and theatrics. He started drawing early. Before Before preschool. “And he was prolific,” says Tom Black, his father. “We have hundreds, hundreds, if not thousands, of his drawings.” Music also became important. His older brother, Howard, a recording recording engineer, took him to see geek punksters Devo during the band’s “Freedom of Choice” tour. The theatrics, the pre-set film, all would be deeply influential. Black also became obsessed with Bobby McFerrin, punching out his own a cappella harmonies on a fourtrack. fourtrack. “Lots of sounds and things coming out of his bedroom door,” says Linda, his stepmother. “I was like, ‘Tom, there’s something wrong with him.’ I’m from Iowa. I never raised a kid who had all that energy and creativity.” Black did struggle. He got into trouble at school, got into cocaine and found himself the target of a bigger kid. His parents placed him at Poseidon, a school for troubled kids in Los Angeles. It was there that he met one of his mentors, theater teacher Deb Devine. “He came into my class with his arms folded, wouldn’t cross the threshold and he slowly worked his way in over time,” Devine says. “He’ll tell you I saved his life, but I believe half of that was his own A touch of Norman Lear in new CBS sitcom TELEVISION FROM E4 Aubry Kaplan, who lives in Inglewood Inglewood and frequently writes about African American issues. All of this informs Cedric the Entertainer’s character, Calvin Butler, whom Reynolds describes as reeling from “what he feels to be the erosion of his community.” In the pilot, Calvin explains to his son, “Our family has been in this neighborhood for generations, and the culture that we’ve worked to create is worthy of respect.” “We want to make people aware that where people grow up and incredible talent, his own personal personal talent that needed to emerge. Can you imagine having Jack Black in your theater class?” By his junior year, Black left Poseidon and headed to Crossroads, Crossroads, an elite, private high school whose alumni include Gwyneth Paltrow and Zooey Deschanel. He starred in “Pippin” and a student film by classmate Brett Morgen, later an accomplished documentarian. documentarian. He tried UCLA but dropped out his sophomore year, joining Tim Robbins’s Actors Gang. That’s where Black met Gass, who was eight years older and into Neil Young and the Eagles. Gass taught Black how to play guitar. Black preached the power of metal. Early on, the band wrote “Tribute,” “Tribute,” a self-referential origin epic that opens with Gass plucking in a minor key and Black promising “this is the greatest and best song in the world” before revealing that it actually isn’t. Everything great about Tenacious D — soaring soaring harmonies, thrashing guitar, goofy spoken word — can be found in that song. “I think the one binding thing was the bravado,” Gass says. “It was the mask, it was the armor that we needed because we’re both tourists, too. We’re not really band guys. We’re shlumpy guys. We don’t look like rock stars. And I only really like to play the acoustic acoustic guitar.” Tenacious D’s first break came on “Mr. Show With Bob and David,” David,” the comedy variety program Bob Odenkirk and David Cross started in 1995. That led to a series of episodes on HBO, which began airing in 1997, and a gig in 1998 at the Viper Room. Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl was there that night. He couldn’t believe believe what he heard. He would effectively become the D’s studio drummer. “If Bobby McFerrin and Ronnie James Dio had a love child, it would be Jack Black,” Grohl says. “He’s totally capable of singing like a professional opera singer. He can stretch, become someone else on screen, but the first time I met him was at the Viper Room. I spent the next 45 minutes rolling on the floor laughing but also blown away that they were so talented.” Crickets, then control The first time Grohl heard about “Post-Apocalypto,” he was confused. “I just assumed they were going straight to Broadway with the thing,” he says. “I didn’t realize it was going to be notebook sketches sketches animated to Tenacious D music.” music.” Black cooked up the idea back in 2016, even before filming “Jumanji: “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.” That film came out in 2017 and earned nearly $1 billion. Tenacious Tenacious D continued to work on what would become their first project since 2012’s “Rize of the Fenix.” Early on, Black pitched the concept of “Post-Apocalypto” to Netflix, Amazon and HBO. “Look at this gem,” he says. “They’d be idiots not to buy this thing. Let the bidding war begin. And crickets. No one was interested.” interested.” He is joking about it now, but Tanya Haden, his wife, could tell where they live, and how they identify themselves is important,” Cedric says. “The idea that because because somebody comes in, you no longer belong, has to come into the conversation.” In the show, the families are candid with one another. Calvin’s son Marty pops by the Johnsons to meet them, saying, “I had to come and see for myself.” When Dave expresses reluctance to attend the Butlers’ barbecue, because he doesn’t want to put off Calvin, Marty explains, “You’ve got to come or you’ll seem racist.” Do neighbors in Kaplan’s neighborhood neighborhood speak that candidly with one another? “Uh, no,” she says with a laugh. With some exceptions, exceptions, she laments, “I’m aware of these white people not communicating communicating with any of us. I feel this terrible loss of control in my own neighborhood. A friend of mine put it this way: They are just waiting waiting until the cavalry arrives. You will be gone soon enough, I don’t need to know you.’” It’s no accident that the JohnTOP: JohnTOP: Actor Jack Black at Poseidon School in 1985 in Los Angeles.

Black, on Page E10, did all of the sketches, more than 3,000 in total, with a ballpoint pen. They were later scanned to a computer to be colorized. sons are transplants from the Midwest Midwest instead of another L.A. neighborhood. Reynolds wanted them to be, he says, “as socially isolated as possible, which would force them to make friends and reach out to their neighbors.” He also wanted the outsider family to embody the traditional Midwestern Midwestern values of being friendly and neighborly. ‘Vida” depicts a very different dynamic. It’s set in a historically immigrant neighborhood southeast southeast of downtown L.A., where a radical anti-gentrification movement movement has led a handful of recently opened galleries and at least one coffee shop to close and leave. Many of ‘Vida’s” scenes are ripped from the headlines, including including when the character Mari spray-paints “white art” (along with an expletive) on a gallery window, an actual oft-cited act of Boyle Heights activist vandalism. The show tells the story of two sisters who grew up in the neighborhood neighborhood but left for Chicago and San Francisco. Show creator Tanya the rejection hurt. She gave him advice. “I said, you can just do it yourself yourself and put it out on YouTube,” she remembers. “Just put it anywhere anywhere you can. Just do it. Because that’s what he told me. Do it to have fun. Don’t worry about who is going to like it.” The script wouldn’t be a script at all. Black and Gass would go for walks or head into the recording studio and just riff. Maybe they should go to Egypt. Maybe there would be a nasty monster or a lonely robot. And even with just the two of them there would be tension. Strangely enough, it was Gass, the less famous partner, who worried worried about image. He thought Black’s penchant for drawing graphic sex scenes might be too much. He also felt funny about using the D to take a political stand. There is a clear, anti-Trump thread in the film. “Here’s what I was worried about,” Gass says. “We were going to be labeled smut peddlers and I was like: ‘Jack, are you sure you want to jeopardize the brand. Because Because the kids love you and the parents love you.’ ” Black finds the whole thing funny. His brand? Saracho says ‘Vida” is aboutgentefication, aboutgentefication, “gentrification of a Latinx space by other, usually upwardly mobile, Latinxs,” she says. “By definition, definition, the sisters coming back and taking over their dead mother’s mother’s bar, with plans for improvement, improvement, makes them gente-fiers.” Now Saracho has herself been accused of gente-fication. Activists Activists argue that she and Starz are profiting off the neighborhood by telling a story about it, and have issued calls to protest on location during production for Season 2. Saracho declined to comment on the topic, preferring to discuss her aims for the series. “I seek to humanize humanize us,” says the showrunner, who was born in Mexico. “We have gotten so very few chances to tell our stories that we are thirsty for any attempt at representation.” Reynolds and Cedric also have lofty goals. Calvin and Dave will become friends, allowing more of their cultural differences to bump up against one another. Cedric describes it as a “family comedy with some degree of the old Nor“This Nor“This could be the reason I don’t get to be in ‘Jumanji 2’?” Black says. “Part of me’s like, bring it. If that’s really going to happen. I almost have that defensive posture. posture. I want to get in the fight. I want to get blacklisted. Because then you’re on this list with these other righteous people.” A monster named Cracka-lacka-ding-dong “The vagina monster was a huge breakthrough for me,” Black says. It is Saturday night and he’s sitting at a diner near his house, enjoying a burger with Swiss cheese and talking about the monster, named Cracka-lackading-dong, Cracka-lackading-dong, that the D must fight in an early scene. Black is asked about his professional future and admits he’s not totally sure. Sometimes, Sometimes, he just wishes his Google calendar would be blank. The movies are fine, though he doesn’t sound desperate to get back on a set. Sure, doing something something with David Lynch or Jim Jarmusch would be cool. But as he approaches 50, Black brings up Jack Nicholson. “He’s not going to do another ‘Cuckoo’s Nest,’ he’s going to do another ‘About Schmidt,’ ” Black man Lear energy.” He adds, ‘We wanted to show how we have to learn to grow, accept, let go of ideas, and allow us to be better people.” At the end of the pilot, Dave earnestly expresses to Malcolm Butler, Calvin’s second son, in a quiet moment, “I really think that if we could focus on what we have in common rather than what makes us different, then we could solve a lot of our problems.” Malcolm replies, “That may be true. But I also think it’s a lot easier for someone like you to believe that than it is for someone like me.” Dave responds simply, “Okay.” Kaplan isn’t sure whites and blacks can evertruly be neighbors. “Gentrification is a euphemism for non-integration. Whites come in and when they occupy space, it has to be white.” She describes an advertisement she saw on the website for an apartment complex on Crenshaw. “I was very startled to find the site has all white people in the pictures and ads. It was DRAWING: JACK BLACK; COLORING: MICHAEL MOLINA says. “It’s time for my About Schmidt.’ ” Then he gets back to the monster, monster, which is actually more of a vagina, penis combo beast. “It’s like, what is this monster going to look like, going to sound like?” he says. “And every chapter, I had to top the previous vagina monster. It really got hard in Episode Episode 5. What’s he going to look like, what’s he going to sound like?” He mentions “The Exorcist.” “When he’s talking to the demon demon or he’s walking down the street and he’s having this dream of a demon. There’s this moment where it’s black space and just a flash of a demon face. It’s not a skeleton, but it’s terrifying. One frame. Maybe it was two or three frames. And I went back and found that demon face and I just copied it. I just stole it.” He finds that funny, just as he planted a robot in “Post-Apocalypto,” “Post-Apocalypto,” who identifies himself as a “terminator sent from the future.” “That’s the truth. Why am I so proud of this thing? It’s really just a hodgepodge of stolen things. But,” and here he smiles and offers at least a glimpse of those devilish eyes, “it’s my hodgepodge.” geoff.edgers@washpost.com chilling.” Kaplan describes neighborhood neighborhood diversity — of race or class — as typically temporary, only existing existing during gentrification, which is a small window. These television shows depict that window. “The Neighborhood” argues that we can learn to get along if we become neighbors. But once the forces of gentrification are in motion, we might not be neighbors for long. It’s already happening to Reynolds’s Reynolds’s Pasadena neighborhood. “When my family moved in, it was with zero intention of being gentrifiers, gentrifiers, but I have come to realize that, despite that intention, we are contributing to that development,” development,” he says. “People I have come to appreciate and befriend are moving away. To see my community community replaced with something more homogenous is the opposite of what I wanted. And yet there is a sense of inevitability. It’s a system. It’s driven by money. And it is much larger than the individuals themselves.” style @ washpost. com COURTESY OF POSEIDON SCHOOL",9/30/2018,"('is', 'aboutgentefication', 'aboutgentefication')","('a', 'latinx', 'space')","[' His brand?

Or Philadelphia. Buffalo. Charlotte, even. Or Detroit. “In hindsight,” Weller said, “it feels like we were never in the running.” The 236 cities that failed to capture capture Amazon’s eye are facing renewed renewed insecurities about their ability to compete for the so-called knowledge jobs that will drive the country’s future economic growth. Some have suggested the losing pitches were good training for the next big deal. Others hope that Amazon might use the data-rich bid documents to locate other projects. That’s apparently what happened with Nashville, which walked away Tuesday with apromise apromise of5,000 new Amazon jobs. But Amazon’s hunt was unnerving unnerving for many cities. The final decision decision to go with two fast-growing coastal hubs only highlighted worries worries about the modern economy’s winner-take-all dynamic. “This is a ‘rich get richer’ story,” said Stephen Walters, an economics economics professor at Loyola University University Maryland. “And it raises a big question for these other cities: How do you get into that league?” It won’t be easy. Amazon’s decision decision highlights the apparent moth-like attraction of tech jobs and the pressure on companies to make expansion decisions that are safe investments. (The Washington Washington Post is owned by Amazon CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos.) “I think Amazon was being sincere,” sincere,” Tom Stringer, who heads the site selection practice for business consulting firm BDO, said of the hunt for new office space. But the odds were stacked against less obSTEVEN obSTEVEN PEARLSTEIN Amazon's arrival means a needfor more housing, transportation infrastructure PEARLSTEIN FROM G1 meet those challenges, which is why cities and states across the country were tripping over themselves to offer financial incentives to a company that surely doesn’t need them. As critics point out, this is the sort of counterproductive competition that governments shouldn’t get into, but as long as others did, it would have been irrational to stand on principle and opt out. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and his team are to be congratulated for putting together a reasonable well-structured package. The $22,000 for each job created should be fully paid back in extra tax revenue within four years, when the payments are due, while the promised investments in transportation and education are worth doing even without Amazon. As for Maryland and the District, they should consider themselves the lucky losers: by Virginia’s own analysis, they will get about a third of Amazon employees as taxpaying residents, along with a fair share of the indirect jobs, without having to provide any incentives. My own rough back-of-theenvelope back-of-theenvelope calculation is that, once Amazon’s decade-long move is complete, Amazon’s 25,000 headquarters jobs, paying an average of $150,000 each, will indirectly generate 37,500 additional jobs throughout in the region, for a total gain of more than 60,000. That should translate into an additional $6.5 billion in regional income, and $650 million more in tax revenue for state and local governments. If a third of that revenue each year were earmarked for transportation, housing and educational infrastructure, that would allow regional governments to borrow an extra $2.5 billion for such projects, some of which could generate their own revenue or attract additional private investment. So how should we invest it? Expand commuter rail service Amazon’s impact will be felt throughout the region, where a good number of Amazon employees will live and many “indirect” jobs will be created. In that respect, the first priority should be to expand commuter rail service in Maryland and Virginia — service that is already stretched as far as it can go, constrained by existing tracks, bridges and stations. One urgent need will be to operate some trains through the District and on to job centers in the other state. That would require major investments at Union Station and on the Civil War-era Long Bridge across the Potomac. With upgraded service, Amazon workers in Crystal City, which has vious cities because of HQ2 s immense immense scale. Amazon has a responsibility responsibility to shareholders to reduce reduce its risk, Stringer said. Indeed, placing the new headquarters in a city that couldn’t handle it could lead to failure. In the last five years, tech firms located in the top headquarter markets of Silicon Valley, Seattle, Boston and New York tended to add new office space in these same markets or a handful of other popular popular cities such as Chicago and Austin, according to a recent report report by commercial real estate research research firm CBRE. Right now, Google is said to be looking at adding more than 10,000 tech jobs in New York City. Amazon’s decision shows the premium placed on luring workers. workers. “They are picking talent to grow revenue above all else,” Stringer said, “and it turns a lot of the arguments about economic development development incentives on their head.” Some of the cities left out expressed expressed frustration with Amazon’s decision — and it was not just sour grapes, they said. It had to do with how the tech giant handled the process, the feedback they got and, in the end, a decision that they said appeared to betray the entire purpose. purpose. Still, Baltimore figured it had a good shot. The city has long sat in Washington’s Washington’s shadow—the scrappy metropolis metropolis just 35 miles up Interstate 95 but seemingly much farther away. Baltimore’s median household household income is about half what it is in Washington. But Baltimore offers offers advantages, too, including house prices that are 80 percent lower. (Yes, that’s right: $99,600 vs. $525,900.) Port Covington is a 235-acre site that sits to the south of Camden Yards and the Inner Harbor. The an inadequate commuter station, could commute from bedroom towns stretching from Frederick, Md., to Fredericksburg, Va. Metrorail is near its peak-hour capacity on lines north and west of the city. The quickest and most cost-effective way to add capacity is to expand existing stations to handle eight-car trains at rush hour. Metro should expedite construction of a second station at Rosslyn for better flow through its tunnel under the Potomac by untangling the Orange and Silver lines from the Blue Line, which serves Crystal City and (in three years) Potomac Yard. Lots of people around Seattle, San Francisco and New York get to work by water ferries, and the Potomac offers Washington the same possibilities if we could establish regular high-speed service from Georgetown south to Mount Vernon in Virginia and Fort Washington in Maryland, with a half dozen stops along the way. One stop could be at the newly named National Landing, from which passengers could travel by elevated, automated monorail (just like Seattle!) to Reagan National Airport, Potomac Yard, Crystal City and Pentagon City. A regional ferry authority could be created to construct the terminals and license a private boat operator to provide the service. For highway congestion, transportation planners tell me the best fix is to complete a network of uninterrupted toll lanes connecting the Beltway, 1-95 North and South and 1-270. All would have dynamic pricing, free travel for car pools and — here’s the big payoff — make it possible for Metro to offer fast and reliable express bus service from the outer suburbs to downtown and major job centers. As Virginians have discovered, such fast-moving toll lanes not only improve life for the commuters who use them, but also for those driving alongside. The toll revenue could be used to construct additional lanes, most urgently on the Beltway’s American Legion Bridge. And while we are on it: If the Washington region wants to be taken seriously as a world-class tech hub, it should figure out how to keep schools and businesses open when there are a few inches of snow. A region that can’t figure out how to use mid-20th-century technology to clear roads, train tracks and bike paths is unlikely to generate the cutting-edge technology of the 21st century. The housing crunch The region already has a housing shortage, with rents and housing prices rising faster than incomes. According to a report by the Urban Institute, a quarter of renters in the region, along with 10 percent of homeowners, have to devote more than 50 percent of SARAH L. VOISIN/THE WASHINGTON POST The pitch inviting Amazon to select Baltimore’s Port Covington site, south of Camden Yards and the Inner Harbor, described “an opportunity for true urban revitalization and community invigoration.” former railroad terminal had been bought up by Sagamore Development, Development, a real estate firm founded by Weller and Under Armour chief executive Kevin Plank. The Baltimore-based Baltimore-based apparel company’s new headquarters are being built there. Plans call for a $5.5 billion mixed-use development. And there was plenty of room for Amazon Amazon to build exactly what it wanted. wanted. “When we heard about Amazon, Amazon, we were like, We have the perfect spot,’ ” said Steve Siegel, a partner at Weller Development, which is working on the site. It has a big airport nearby. It has the interstate running right by its door. Major universities are located located nearby. There were plans to bring a commuter rail stop to the project. Maryland’s governor threw his support behind Baltimore’s Baltimore’s bid — despite D.C. suburb RICKY CARIOTI/THE WASHINGTON POST Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) speaks after Amazon announced it would split its new headquarters between New York and Virginia, which directly and indirectly will bring over 60,000 jobs to the region. their income to housing costs. And among those who find more affordable housing in the outer suburbs, a quarter are forced to commute 45 minutes or more each way. Without an increase in the right kind of housing at the right price in the right locations, the addition of 60,000 jobs to a fully employed region will only make all those things worse. The biggest problem is overly restrictive zoning and drawn-out approval processes that discourage development. The Urban Institute and the Greater Washington Partnership, representing the region’s top business leaders, have begun to work with local officials to set housing production goals for each jurisdiction that, collectively, would be sufficient to meet the region’s demand for an additional 250,000 housing units by 2025. They also are putting together a tool kit of policy ideas that cities and counties can use to better meet demand: accelerated approval processes, incentives or requirements for low-income units in all developments, housing trust funds and community land trusts to acquire parcels for development, zoning that permits higher density around subway stops. While all those sound like good ideas, experience suggests they won’t be able to overcome the forces of neighborhood preservation and the not-in-mybackyard-ism not-in-mybackyard-ism that exist in many communities. In the District, where strong demand has led to gentrification of many neighborhoods, there is already political pushback against any development that displaces more Montgomery County’s competing bid that came with $5 billion in public incentives. Port Covington supporters clearly expected Amazon to weigh less tangible criteria, too. Baltimore’s Baltimore’s pitch, loaded on Kindles and sent to Amazon, argued that this was about more than just a second headquarters: “The HQ2 project will be — in the right place — an opportunity for true urban revitalization and community invigoration.” invigoration.” It might sound lofty. But the developers pointed to businesses that measure not just their fiscal bottom line but their social impact bottom line. We have a double bottom line. We believe in it,” Weller said. “And we thought they’d think the same thing,” Siegel said. But Baltimore didn’t even make the list of 20 finalist cities. low-income residents. And the new county executive in Montgomery County, channeling concerns about overcrowded schools and clogged roads, opposes new construction in most neighborhoods. Rather than trying to overcome such resistance, a better strategy might be to direct public investment to places like Anacostia in the District, Prince George’s County in Maryland and Prince William and Stafford counties in Virginia, where underutilized land is cheaper and available, transportation infrastructure exists and is underused and the political climate is favorable. The three states could jump-start housing development by providing the infrastructure for neighborhoods and a more favorable regulatory environment in which to build them. Such inducements are sure to lure developers and residents. Imagine, for example, a newly created agency that has sufficient seed funding and bonding authority to buy up a large tract of underdeveloped land convenient to a metro stop, commuter train station or highway exit. With the land in hand, the agency could build a state-of-the-art elementary school, a library, a bus station with a parking garage and a recreation center surrounded by playgrounds and playing fields. It could partner with a private developer to build an oldfashioned oldfashioned neighborhood retail district with a movie theater, supermarket, medical building with plenty of on-street parking and space for a weekly farmers market. The developer might be required to lease at least half the Neither did Charlotte. The city was stunned when Nashville and even interstate rival Raleigh were named finalists. ‘What’s wrong with our city?” wondered a headline in the Charlotte Charlotte Observer. The corporate development development world took note. “Heads are rolling in Charlotte over this,” said John Boyd, a corporate corporate site selection consultant in Princeton, N. J. In September, the Charlotte Regional Regional Partnership — which had spearheaded the city’s Amazon bid — announced it was merging with the Charlotte Chamber. The new group will have a new leader along with a new — and still undecided — name. Officials continue to wonder where it all went wrong. “I’m still surprised,” said Tariq Bokhari, a city councilman who was involved in preparing Charsmaller Charsmaller storefronts to independent retailers who would provide the services that residents most need and value — not only the retailers who will pay the highest rents. Around the town center, one area could be rezoned for only two- and three-story townhouses with basement apartments and small back terraces. Another area would be zoned exclusively for four-story “loft” buildings with hipster apartments and coffee shops and health clubs on the first floor. Another could be zoned for small two- and three-bedroom houses with front porches on tiny lots. Sidewalks, sewers and water lines could be installed as necessary, while the entire community could be wired for high-speed broadband. Every few blocks, the agency could create a public playground or pocket park or victory garden. A special tax lien would be put on every property that will allow the government to recoup its infrastructure investments when properties are sold. Although there are plenty of private companies that knowhow to do such large-scale, mixed-use developments, they are devilishly difficult to pull off. Assembling the land, obtaining the government permits and securing the patient financing often doom such ambitious projects before they can take off. But a public development agency with broad powers and some subsidies could overcome such challenges and provide the catalyst for private investment and development. And where developers have the instinct to maximize their returns by lottes Amazon bid. Bokhari said the tech giant cited a shortage of tech talent as one of the city’s drawbacks. But Bokhari pointed out that Charlotte has no problem attracting new workers, making it one of the fastestgrowing fastestgrowing cities. Then, last month, Charlotte was named by a major computing trade group as the No. 1 place for tech talent to live and work. For Bokhari, that cast even more doubt on Amazon’s criticism. “It felt like they had already decided where to go,” he said. A lack of tech talent was the same feedback Amazon gave to Baltimore. But city officials said the talent is here — and could’ve been lured by Baltimore’s charms. They pointed to cybersecurity companies companies that recently announced plans to open operations in Port Covington. While the Amazon spectacle has few parallels, it does recall what happened when General Motors Motors announced plans for a $5 billion billion auto plant for its new Saturn brand in 1985. Governors from more than two dozen states visited Detroit to personally pitch GM’s chairman. Cities put up billboards along Detroit freeways to extol their virtues. A group of governors even went on Phil Donahue’s talk show to make their case. GM built its Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., outside Nashville. Nashville. The Saturn brand was killed off in 2010. But the auto plant is still there, making Cadillacs and GMCs. In the wake of Amazon’s decision, decision, at least one development official official said he envied how Little Rock handled itself last year: It took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post to say it wasn’t even bothering to bid for HQ2 — “It’s just not us.” todd.frankel @ washpost. com creating charmless high-rise jungles with lots of office space and chain retailers (Crystal City, Rosslyn and the Nationals Park area come to mind), a public agency could be charged with creating vibrant and enduring neighborhoods with the scale and character that people prefer. This more muscular approach to economic development and urban planning went out of fashion 50 years ago, but is used successfully in other countries. It may be the only way to overcome market failures and parochial interests that have led to housing shortages in Washington and other booming regions. Higher education Years ago, I got myself in some trouble with local college presidents by writing that Washington’s economy was held back by the lack of a truly worldclass worldclass university. I lamented that Virginia Tech was located in rural Blacksburg, in the southwestern part of the state, where its potential for economic spinoff was pretty much wasted. Now, thanks to Amazon, that potential will finally be realized. The initial plan is to locate a $1 billion satellite campus at Potomac Yard, with room for 500 graduate students, research labs and spinoff companies. But my guess is that, before long, Virginia Tech’s footprint will expand well beyond that for the simple reason that students and faculty will prefer it and private capital will encourage it. The prospect of Tech’s arrival in Washington is already spurring competitive investment from Washington’s other universities. George Mason University, where I teach, also took the opportunity recently to announce plans for a new School of Computing at its Arlington campus. By increasing the density of the higher-ed sector, this campus ofVirginia Tech will boost the fortunes of all the region’s universities. Keeping it in perspective It’s important to keep all of this in perspective. While 25,000 thousand jobs is nothing to sneeze at, as the D.C. Policy Center pointed out in an excellent recent analysis, it’s less than the 34,000 the region has added, on average, every year since 2000. Even if Amazon had not come,many of those jobs probably would have been created. Still, the quest for HQ2, along with the bid for the Olympics and the restructuring of Metro’s financing and governance, has taken regional awareness and cooperation to new levels. If Amazon’s arrival can spur even deeper collaboration on housing and transportation, that — not the jobs — may prove to be the most significant impact of all. pearlstein@washpost.com",11/18/2018,"('has', 'led', 'to')","('many', 'neighborhoods', 'there')","[' In the District, where strong demand has led to gentrification of many neighborhoods, there is already political pushback against any development that displaces more Montgomery County’s competing bid that came with $5 billion in public incentives.']", In the District where strong demand has led to gentrification of many neighborhoods there is already political pushback against any development that displaces more Montgomery Countys competing bid that came with 5 billion in public incentives
524,2165324864,"BEST OF 2018 SHOWS FROM Ely tion (with director Ben Stiller) of this story of two convicted murderers (Benicio Del Toro and Paul Dano) who escaped a maximum-security maximum-security prison in 2015 with the help of a besotted employee (Patricia Arquette) is striking for its unadorned quality. It’s a disciplined example of how a masterful true-crime miniseries can skip the need to play up a theme or suss out a larger meaning — which, if you still need one, is about human corruption. What if remorseless people are just bad and get exactly what’s coming to them? 5. “Kidding” (Showtime) Despite my initial worry that David Holstein’s Holstein’s dramedy about a troubled but beloved kids TV host (Jim Carrey as Jeff, a.k.a. “Mr. Pickles”) might bump too close to the sacred memory of Mister Rogers, “Kidding” stands entirely on its own. “Kidding’s” conception of Mr. Pickles’s imaginary world — with puppets and songs — shows top-notch creativity while Carrey gives his most memorable performance performance in years as a grieving father and estranged husband who begins to reexamine everything he thought he knew about love and feelings. 6. “Insecure” (HBO) My interest in what happens to the characters characters Issa Rae and company have created in this hilarious and sharply observed dramedy continues unabated — particularly with the show’s third season, in which Rae’s character leaped before she looked, quitting her job as a social worker, becoming a Lyft driver and testing the patience of friends. Beyond the comedy scenes, which are fantastic (that girls’ trip to Coachella alone is worth a re-watch), there’s covert reporting here about surviving the rapid, widening gentrification of Los Angeles. 7. “The Fourth Estate” (Showtime) With President Trump demonizing the media (and recently implying that it’s okay to kill a journalist under certain conditions), master documentarian Liz Garbus delivered this astounding and intimate look at the inner workings of the New York Times’s Washington Washington bureau, where reporters and editors relentlessly pursue the administration’s constant constant chaos. I remain hopeful that “The Fourth Estate” will reach an audience beyond Beltway news junkies. All Americans need to EPISODES FROM E17 3. “Barry”: “Make Your Mark” One could argue that eight episodes on this list should be devoted to “Barry,” a critically acclaimed HBO dramedy from Alec Berg and “Saturday Night Live” alum Bill Hader. I’m bestowing the highest honor on the sharp pilot episode, which introduces us to Barry (Hader), an aimless hit man who finds unexpected passion in an acting class. “Make Your Mark,” directed by Hader, is an apt title because the episode establishes everything that’s wonderful about “Barry” — Barry’s earnestness, the quirky cast of characters characters in his acting class (taught by an especially especially delightful Henry Winkler) and the dumb but hilarious goons intent on keeping Barry in his less-savory line of work. Also consider: “Loud, Fast and Keep Going” 4. “Killing Eve”: “I Have a Thing About Bathrooms” The fifth episode of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s thriller, based on the novella series by Luke Jennings, brings the cat-and-mouse game between unlikely spy Eve (Sandra Oh) and metopera.fathomevents.com FATHOM gP eve ntb The Met: Live in HD series is made possible by Digital support of The Met: The Met: Live in HD The HD broadcasts a generous grant from its founding sponsor Live in HD is provided by series is supported by are supported by The Neubauer Family Foundation Bloomberg Philanthropies t ROLEX “To// Brothers LIVE JAN 12 Encore Jan 16 LIVE FEB 2 Encore Feb 6, 9 LIVE MAR 2 Encore Mar 6 CILEA BIZET DONIZETTI ADRIANA LECOUVREUR CARMEN LA FILLE DU REGIMENT Vincent Peters/Met Opera TOP: Holly Taylor plays Paige Jennings, the daughter of Soviet spies, in FX’s “The Americans.” ABOVE: Inmates (played by Paul Dano, left, and Benicio Del Toro) plot to break out of a prison with the help of an employee in Showtime’s “Escape at Dannemora.” WILSON WEBB/SHOWTIME COLLEEN HAYES/NBC Kristen Bell plays Eleanor and William Jackson Harper stars as Chidi in NBC’s philosophical comedy, “The Good Place.” psychopathic assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) Comer) to thrilling heights as the two meet (officially) for the first time. It’s not the contentious confrontation a casual viewer might expect. Eve is empathetic empathetic toward Villanelle, and even though Villanelle Villanelle may be incapable of returning said empathy, the women share an air of longing that deepens their mutual obsession. It’s one of the most suspenseful moments of the series — and that’s saying something for a show that kept us on edge week after week. Also consider: “God, I’m Tired” 5. “This Is Us”: “The Car” NBC put a lot of promo power behind the storied “Super Bowl Sunday” episode of “This Is Us,” which finally answered the question of how Jack (the Pearson family patriarch played by Milo Ventimiglia) died. But it was the following episode, titled “The Car,” that encapsulated the crushing weight of that loss. In flashbacks, Jack goes to great lengths to buy a Wagoneer that is perfect for his family, but firmly outside their budget. As the timeline moves forward, we see how integral the car is to the Pearsons and their lives together — through health scares, petty arguments and teenage milestones. Watching Watching those largely mundane moments play out in the wake of Jack’s death makes the loss even more emotional. “The Car” is a stunning portrait of family grief — and a father’s unconditional love. Also consider: “Super Bowl Sunday” 6. “The Haunting of Hill House”: “Two Storms” Amid all of the chills and thrills of Netflix’s adaptation of Shirley Jackson’s 1959 gothic horror novel, the show deftly explores the complex dynamics of a family marked by grief. “Two Storms” brings that grief into sharp focus, as the Crain siblings gather to mourn. The ensemble cast, particularly Timothy Hutton as Hugh, the Crain family patriarch, does some of its best work here, as they unfurl JEFFREY NEIRA/FX all of the hurt, blame and resentment that grief can dredge up. The episode certainly validates all those “This Is Us” comparisons. Also consider: “The Bent-Neck Lady” 7. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”: “The Box” Fans came to the rescue of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” after Fox canceled the comedy earlier this year (the sixth season will premiere premiere on NBC in January) and this delightful bottle episode captures why the show is so beloved. Sterling K. Brown guest stars as a dentist suspected of murdering the co-owner of his practice. Over the course of one night, he is interrogated by poker-faced Capt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) and his best detective, the lovable goofball Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg). “The Box” showcases the hilarious banter between the two officers as they try to get the quick-witted Philip Davidson (Brown, showcasing his comedic chops, in typically fine form) to confess his crime. Also consider: “Jake and Amy” 8. “Forever”: “Andre and Sarah” Amazon’s dreamy “Forever” is about June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen), a married couple whose lives together take an unexpected turn. But the sixth episode shifts its perspective to another pair altogether. Andre and Sarah (Jason Mitchell and Hong Chau) are two real-estate agents who find themselves drawn to each other after meeting meeting at an open house. The episode explores their deep connection connection — and the realities that threaten it — but “Forever” resists the inclination to explain exactly what’s going on and how they relate to June and Oscar’s story. That’s a good call, allowing “Andre and Sarah” to function as both a stand-alone episode and a funhouse mirror to the show’s contemplative themes. Also consider: “Goodbye Forever” 9. “The Good Place”: “Rhonda, Diana, Jake and Trent” This Season 2 episode of Michael Schur’s afterlife comedy follows Eleanor (Kristen Bell), Chidi (William Jackson Harper), Tahani Tahani (Jameela Jamil) and Jason (Manny Jacinto) Jacinto) out of the Good Place and into, ahem, another realm. The trip offers fans multiple gifts: disguises, aliases and double duty from D’Arcy Carden, who plays two versions of Janet, the show’s transcendent concierge. Michael (Ted Danson) is their helpful guide, who is responsible for some of the episode’s best lines including: “Jason, this is hell. Of course there’s a gift shop.” But it’s Tahani who sums up the episode’s appeal: “Character work. Such fun!” Also consider: “Best Self’ 10. “BoJack Horseman”: “The Stopped Show” This episode marks a satisfying end to the fifth season of this consistently good Netflix show about an anthropomorphic horse struggling struggling with addiction and the pitfalls of fame. It finds BoJack at the center of a public-relations public-relations disaster that forces him to confront his demons — and his tendency to hurt the women in his life. The episode is a shrewd sendup of Hollywood (or, in this case, Hollywoo) Hollywoo) and the culture that has enabled widespread abuse and harassment by powerful powerful men. Also consider: “Free Churro” bethonie.butler@washpost.com see this example of the First Amendment m action. 8. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon) It’s on this list as much for its first, Emmy-winning season as its just-released (and so far equally marvelous) second season. This comic period drama about a hyperactive 1950s Manhattan housewife who finds her calling in the Village’s stand-up comedy scene is creator Amy Sherman-Palladino’s grandest achievement yet — welcoming, yet bracingly obnoxious (yes, that’s a good thing), with a dazzling attention to timing and detail. “Mrs. Maisel” is scrumptious from start to finish — and appreciatively forthright about pursuing one’s dream in the face of sexism and other midcentury norms. 9. “Atlanta Robbin’ Season” (FX) Most of the talk around this long-awaited second season of Donald Glover’s dramedy — about a peripatetic man (Glover) who winds up managing the nascent rap career of his moody cousin (Brian lyree Henry) — centered centered on the “Teddy Perkins” episode, a horror-tinged tale of a Michael Jacksonesque recluse (also played by Glover). But the season’s deeper story arcs, set against the unease of the holidays (a.k.a. “robbin’ season”), season”), further cemented the show’s real worth as a study of the human condition. 10. “Forever” (Amazon) People often say we’re living in an era of outrage, but I think we’re living more in a time of perpetual sadness. A delicate sense of grief (ennui, maybe?) runs through some of the year’s best TV shows, particularly in Alan Yang’s effectively quirky “Forever,” in which Fred Armisen and Maya Rudolph play a married couple who discover the afterlife is just an extension of their bland (yet content) suburban routines. Some viewers complained that they expected more LOLs from a show starring two SNL alums, but in the end, we got something far better: a perfect meditation on the meaning of love and commitment. Some notable additions, if this list could he longer: “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu); “Lodge 49” (AMC); “The Good Place” (NBC); “Star Trek; Discovery” (CBS All Access); “Homecoming” (Amazon); “You” (Lifetime); “This Is Us”(NBC); and “GLOW” (Netflix). hank.stuever @ washpost.com Disclosure: Amazon founder Jeffrey P.

The city’s 22-page report is titled titled “LIVE. LONG. DC.: Washington, Washington, DC’s Strategic Plan to Reduce Opioid Use, Misuse, and Related Deaths.” It outlines in broad strokes the creation or expansion of dozens of initiatives to reduce opioid use, treat victims and educate educate city residents about the dangers dangers of addiction. “We are devoted to tailoring our response in a manner that is specific specific to Washington, DC, based on our history, demographics, and trends in usage so that we can stem this scourge,” Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said in the report. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) called the plan’s timeline timeline ambitious but necessary, even as he acknowledged that cutting deaths in half by October 2020 may seem unrealistic. “I’d argue the urgency of this crisis — and the sheer number of lives lost — warrants setting an ambitious and necessary call to action,” he said in a text message. The number of opioid-related deaths in the city has more than tripled in recent years, from 83 in 2014 to 279 in 2017. More than 70 percent of the deaths involved the synthetic opioid fentanyl or its analogues, which dealers in recent years increasingly have mixed with heroin to make the drug more powerful and maximize their profits. More than 8 in 10 D.C. overdose victims were African Americans who lived in Wards 7 and 8, the poorest parts of the city. Most were between 40 and 69 years old. The D.C. report found that nearly a quarter of overdose victims had been using heroin for more than 40 years and about 60 percent had used it for more than a quarter-century. quarter-century. The plan, written by a group of D.C. agencies, doctors, substance abuse treatment providers, council council members and individuals in recovery, calls for the establishment establishment within six months of a fatality fatality review board to analyze all opioid-related opioid-related deaths in the District. A year from now, the city plans to implement a plan to educate public school students about the risk of illegal and prescription drugs. Similar measures have existed existed for years in other US. cities and states hard-hit by the opioid epidemic. Many of the recommendations in the D.C. plan are vague and endorse the expansion of strategies strategies already in place in the city, such as recovery housing options, drug take-back programs run by police and firefighters, and distribution distribution of kits with the overdosereversing overdosereversing drug naloxone. District officials say more than 700 overdose reversals have been reported using naloxone distributed distributed by the city. But The Post investigation found that the District District lags far behind Baltimore, Philadelphia and other cities in making sure naloxone reaches drug users. It also found that outreach outreach and other programs that were proposed and funded in recent recent years never materialized because because city agencies failed to hire and train employees to staff them. The District dragged its feet in implementing a program that allows allows D.C. residents to buy naloxone in pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription, The Post reported. The city’s health director, LaQuandra LaQuandra Nesbitt, refused to implement it, saying the legislation gave too much authority to pharmacists and did not protect pharmacists who chose not to dispense naloxone naloxone from legal liability. After the council approved changes Nesbitt requested, she began began taking steps to make the drug available this month. Opioid deaths are on track to drop in the District this year, mirroring mirroring a decline in other cities and several states. The reason is unclear. unclear. Some officials cite prevention prevention efforts, but medical experts say chronic users may have learned to be more careful when using fentanyl-tainted heroin.

That?s how ?Confection? works, though: It?s trick or treat, have or have not, sweet or sour. The show, commissioned for Folger, is an exploration of the nobility?s opulent opulent banquets during the Age of Exploration and the era of Shakespeare Shakespeare ? and the human price of those feasts. The show comes from Third Rail Projects, a New York-based company that focuses on site-specific site-specific and movement-oriented works. Written and directed by the company?s artistic director, Zach Morris, it tracks nicely with the Folger Shakespeare Library?s current exhibition, ?Before ?Farm to Table?: Early Modern Foodways and Cultures,? featuring historic cookbooks and artifacts. At the nexus of it all is sugar. The lovely tiered cakes and outlandish outlandish feasts that grew popular as more ingredients from the colonies colonies became available were possible possible only through the enslavement enslavement of African people, the show makes clear. ?Confection? doesn?t follow a linear plot, and the characters characters are never named. But a series of vignettes ? some are dance or movement-based only ? build up to a message about wealth and humanity. In one, a character asks: ?When does a body become a thing that?s fit to be consumed?? ?Confection? is set in the Folger?s Folger?s reading room, and it?s a treat Anacostia Museum will close for renovations by Peggy McGlone The Smithsonian?s Anacostia Community Museum will close Friday for a seven-month renovation renovation to upgrade its entrance and increase its usable outdoor space and community garden.

Dear Heloise: I have a warning for just to see a space that?s usually off-limits to the public. The audience audience is led through the reading room and its connected spaces, including a narrow card-catalogue card-catalogue room, and split into smaller groups, so you may not see the same scenes as someone in a different different group. You might be touched by the performers: on the arms, or even on the face. You?ll be close enough that as you?re sitting at a table, the silk of their swishy Shakespearean-era formalwear might graze your cheek. They?ll make eye contact in a way that is, depending on your comfort level, engaging or unnerving. And they will challenge you. Because even though ?Confection? ?Confection? is about history, it?s also about the present day: The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, and food, increasingly, increasingly, has become a symbol of that. (Except now, sugary foods are cheap, and it?s the wealthy who can afford to forgo them.) Many of the vignettes start out as opulent frivolity, and turn on a dime to something more insidious. insidious. And when our participation is demanded ? as in scenes where we?re part of a banquet with the performers, or invited to play a game that?s really an exercise in game theory ? it?s in service of a lesson about fairness, equality and chance.

1090,2233143208,"FROM PREVIOUS PAGE the street. At the last official count in 2018, there were 6,904 homeless people in the District, which has a population of just over 700,000. A recent study by the National Community Reinvestment Reinvestment Coalition found that the District has experienced the most intense gentrification of any city in the country. Naimah Simkins, the former property manager at Sedgwick Gardens, said that in early 2017, she listed basement units she was having trouble leasing on a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website. Soon, there was a trickle of formerly homeless or low-income low-income veterans bearing vouchers issued by the D.C. government. Cleveland Park is a bastion of urbane liberalism where just 1 in 20 voters supported President Trump in the 2016 election. Yet from the beginning, Simkins said, it was clear that some of the building?s older residents were discomfited by the new basement dwellers. She likened the dynamic to ?The People Under the Stairs,? a 1991 kitsch horror movie in which a well-to-do couple live above a cellar filled with mistreated children. children. ?It would be, like, the smallest thing that they would call the police on,? Simkins said. She said the more established tenants ?feel uneasy, but if they would just reach out and talk, they would see that (tenants with vouchers) are human beings, too.? After moving into the building about two years ago, voucher holder Joseph A. Bundy, 69, said he was smoking outside one day when another resident approached approached him: ?This lady came up and said, ?Don?t you know there?s a park up the street?? I said, What you talking about, a park up the street? My home?s right here.? ? Lawrence Hilliard, a 69-yearold 69-yearold Marine Corps veteran who previously lived at the homeless men?s shelter on New York Avenue, Avenue, said a social worker took him on a tour of apartments where he could use his rental voucher. At the initial addresses in Southeast, Hilliard said he was warned by residents that the sound of gunshots made it hard to sleep at night. Sedgwick Gardens, in a neighborhood neighborhood of parks and small businesses businesses where Hilliard had done odd jobs as a young man, was a revelation. ?It was away from the violence and the foolishness, man, that?s the main thing,? he said, smoking a cigarette on a recent evening in the building?s parking lot, which adjoins a vibrant patch of World War II victory gardens still tended tended by community members. ?And then the violence and the foolishness foolishness came up here.? ?I have a shotgun? There were 121 calls for police service at Sedgwick Gardens in 2018, up from 34 in 2016. City officials said despite that volume, officers determined just five times last year that a crime had taken place. Still, a number of the incidents left residents rattled. On Palm Sunday of last year, officers responding to a noise complaint encountered Robert Gingell, who according to a police report could be heard throwing objects around his third-floor apartment. When they knocked on the door, Gingell allegedly said, ?If you try to come into my apartment, apartment, I have a shotgun and will shoot all of you. I will pick you off one by one.? A police tactical team filed through the historic carriage porch and across the limestoneand-marble limestoneand-marble lobby and set up a perimeter outside Gingell?s apartment, apartment, where he holed up until the next morning. Although no gun was found, Gingell was arrested. arrested. He was released ? and then arrested again at Sedgwick Gardens Gardens two days later, accused of striking another tenant in the head with a flashlight. Gingell could not be reached for comment. Court documents say he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted threats to do bodily harm, agreeing to undergo mental mental health and substance abuse assessments and treatment as necessary. In February, his community supervision supervision officer reported that he no longer lived at Sedgwick Gardens, Gardens, but at another apartment building in Northwest Washington. Washington. About a month after the SWAT team?s visit, police were called to the building to investigate the whereabouts of 68-year-old tenant tenant Jacob Brooks, who according to building staff had not been seen in weeks. When he did not answer his door, police entered his apartment and found him on the floor of his bedroom, unconscious unconscious and not breathing, according according to an incident report. Fire and emergency medical services officials officials called to the scene declared him dead. The chief medical examiner determined determined that his death was caused by drugs including fentanyl, fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that often causes overdoses when it is mixed with heroin. City officials declined to say whether Gingell or Brooks were receiving rental assistance, citing privacy laws. Tenants say they have also confronted confronted a slew of less serious nuisances such as panhandling, marijuana smoke in the halls and feces discovered on a landing in the stairwell. Diane McWhorter, a Sedgwick Gardens resident and author of ?Carry Me Home,? a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about segregation segregation and the civil rights movement, movement, said bureaucratic bungling was undermining the laudable aims of the voucher programs. ?I became extremely disillusioned disillusioned with the city as a result of this whole thing because I kind of lost faith in their willingness or ability to respond to what was happening on the ground,? McWhorter said. ?Cleveland Park is the ideal community to test this out because because by and large the existing residents are very hospitable to these ideas,? she added. ?It just would behoove them to try to make this work here. Because the odds are, if it can?t work here, they?re going to have a hard time selling it in communities that aren?t as ?woke.? ? McWhorter said landlords also have little incentive to turn away tenants unfit for independent living living because the vouchers guarantee guarantee them rents in excess of market rates. And there is an added perk. In buildings such as Sedgwick Gardens, Gardens, where many older tenants pay less for rent-stabilized units, apartments that are let out to tenants receiving public assistance assistance don?t revert to rent control once those tenants leave. Last year, the D.C. Council took action to close this loophole, but the law has not yet gone into effect. A spokeswoman for Daro, which owns and manages Sedgwick Sedgwick Gardens, said the company had not taken steps either ?to solicit or discourage voucher holders from applying? and noted that it was illegal for landlords to discriminate against tenants receiving receiving government rental subsidies. subsidies. She said Daro addressed problems problems with tenants as they arose. ?Beyond enforcing lease violations violations and working to evict tenants who repeatedly violate the terms of their lease, Daro has worked with city officials, police, case managers, housing officials and other tenants to create a safe environment,? she said. Housing first ? or housing only? For decades, the homeless often often faced obstacles in the search for long-term housing. Among them was the mind-set that issues such as chronic mental illness or addiction should be under control control before people became eligible to live outside shelters or group homes. ?Housing first? revolutionized that attitude. Backed by a formidable formidable body of research showing that it reduces chronic homelessness, homelessness, it has become the dominant philosophy in the District and many other cities. ?Housing is therapeutic in and of itself, and there should be no behavioral barriers to access to housing,? said Jay Melder, the District?s assistant city administrator administrator for internal services. ?Housing first is a best practice, nationwide.? But as that practice spreads, some are urging caution against a one-size-fits-all attitude. Particularly for those who have endured prolonged bouts of homelessness or mental illness, the approach is risky, said David Buck, associate dean of community community health at the University of Houston College of Medicine. While studies clearly support the effectiveness of housing-first programs, Buck said, they can fall apart when participants don?t get the follow-up care they need. Government officials and advocates advocates for the homeless ?want one answer for everyone,? Buck said. ?Housing first and just the voucher works great for some people. But for people who are chronically mentally ill or chronically chronically homeless ... those people don?t do as well just jumping in.? A majority of the D.C. Council is backing a bill, introduced by Nadeau, Nadeau, that would require buildings buildings with at least 20 units and 30 percent or more of them occupied by tenants receiving housing assistance assistance to offer on-site access to social services such as health care, nutrition counseling and child care. Nadeau said the bill did not arise in response to complaints complaints about Sedgwick Gardens. Melder noted that only a portion portion of the voucher holders at Sedgwick Gardens are formerly homeless or in need of ongoing social services. Some, including families, simply qualified for public public assistance because of their low incomes. Case managers were assigned to those who required services, he said, even before the city began stationing social workers at the building two months ago. But Sedgwick Gardens tenants say some of their new neighbors seem lost. Jane Hardin, 79, has lived in the building since 1974. She said most of the voucher holders are good neighbors, apt to say hello or open a door for her. She likes seeing some of the older men who have moved into the building playing checkers in the basement common space. Then there is the woman who moved in alone down the hall, who moans and screams incomprehensibly incomprehensibly for long stretches of the day and night, who seems to badly need help she isn?t getting. On Christmas Day last year, Hardin Hardin said, she found her sitting by herself near the elevator. It seemed like a good time to try to establish a connection. ?I looked at her and just said, ?Merry Christmas,? and she nodded nodded her head and almost smiled,? Hardin recalled. ?But I haven?t been able to build on that.? peter.jamison @ washpost.com p A designer's guide to your dream home.

671,2235292999,"Where to draw the line on middle-class housing subsidies? HOUSING FROM A1 handout, how high is too high? The new investments in middle-income middle-income homes ? sometimes called ?workforce housing? and often marketed as help for public employees such as police officers, teachers and firefighters ? reflect an undeniable reality of urban life in the 21st century: Even collegeeducated collegeeducated workers in decently paid professions are having trouble trouble making ends meet. But critics of the new focus on affordable housing for the middle class say it risks diverting scarce resources from those with little or no income, including people who live in decrepit public housing conditions or on the street. Opponents say the initiatives also carry an unmistakable whiff of political showmanship, aiming to appease a sector of the population population that votes at higher rates and is often viewed more sympathetically sympathetically than those living in poverty or homelessness. ?The American narrative around poverty, which is that people bring it on themselves, is harder to force on this sacrosanct group which people call the middle middle class,? said Michael Anderson, director of the Housing Trust Fund Project at the nonprofit Center for Community Change. Anderson said he has watched with trepidation as local governments, governments, many of them struggling with rampant homelessness, have embraced the idea of diverting taxpayer dollars to housing for people with six-figure incomes. ?I think it would be a perilous mistake at this time in our history to have a focus shift upward on the income level when we still haven?t met the very clear and basic need of those at the very lowest,? he said. Such tensions are acute in the District. A rising population and booming real estate development have brought trendy restaurants and luxury apartment buildings to neighborhoods that were once refuges for those with modest incomes. The city has seen rapid displacement displacement of longtime residents ? the National Community Reinvestment Reinvestment Coalition recently determined determined that the District has experienced the most intense gentrification of any U.S. city ? and persistent homelessness. The impending arrival of Amazon?s second headquarters across the Potomac River in Arlington is expected to further drive up D.C. rents and home prices in the coming years. Although Bowser has devoted substantial sums to creating or preserving affordable housing for those at the bottom of the income ladder, some advocates say her investments are insufficient, given given the scope of the problem. An analysis last year by the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning left-leaning think tank, found that less than a third of rental units produced produced by D.C. housing programs Relatives of Saudi prisoners, seeking information, take the risk of going public PRISONERS FROM A1 with its penchant for privacy, responds better to private entreaties entreaties than public scolding. Several relatives said they went public after trying, and failing, to find back doors to government officials. Their frustrations are the consequence consequence of the changes being wrought by Crown Prince Mohammed Mohammed bin Salman, who is making the kingdom more authoritarian authoritarian than in the past, critics critics say, even as he is relaxing some strict social codes. The profiles of these families reflect the breadth of Mohammed?s crackdown, which began in earnest earnest in September 2017 and has led to the arrests of people for their dissent, their prominence or for reasons that remain a mystery to their families and the public. The decision-making by the kingdom?s leaders seems increasingly increasingly unpredictable, relatives say, and thus the risk of staying quiet even greater. Some said the killing of journalist journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October ? a once unthinkable act of brutality against a critic of the government government ? also hastened their decisions decisions to speak up. Saudi officials say the agents had disobeyed orders to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia alive, and several are now on trial. Some relatives said their families families had previously stayed far from politics and taken care not to attract the attention of Saudi law enforcement. Others were speaking up for family members who are prominent activists. For the crown prince, some of the arrests have served as a BENJAMIN C TANKERSLEY FOR THE WASHINGTON POST The Southwest Waterfront has seen a surge in high-end condos and apartments. Housing tensions are on the rise in the District, where trendy restaurants and luxury buildings have overtaken neighborhoods that were once refuges for those with modest incomes. ?Most people, on paper, it appears that they can afford things that in fact they really can?t because of the cost of living in this area .... But once you pay your bills, there?s not a whole lot left. ? Yolanda Geter, emergency services dispatcher for the D.C. government are accessible to those making under 30 percent of area median income, despite the fact that most households struggling to afford their rent fall into that category. Most of the affordable units are going to those making 50 or 60 percent of area median income, the institute found. The mayor?s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year does not set aside any new funding for upkeep to public housing, despite an estimated $340 million backlog backlog in repairs for immediate health and safety hazards. Bowser?s proposed $20 million workforce fund would help create affordable homes for people making making between 60 and 120 percent of the District?s median income ? roughly $70,000 to $141,000 for a family of four. ?I do think we have to think about how we help middle-income middle-income folks, but I?m not sure that this is the right program,? said D.C. Council member Elissa Silverman Silverman (I-At Large). She said some money in the workforce fund could be put to better use on public housing renovations, and that the remaining dollars should be aimed at helping those making between 60 and 80 percent of area median income. useful way to send messages to segments of Saudi society ? to discourage other would-be activists, activists, for example, or to assuage religious conservatives alarmed at some of the social changes Mohammed has championed, analysts say. But the scale of the clampdown clampdown may have created a new headache for the Saudi leadership: leadership: a small but growing cohort of relatives who have shined a light on arrests the government would prefer be kept quiet, presenting presenting an unflattering portrait of the kingdom. A Saudi government media office did not respond to questions questions about the status of Abdulrahman Abdulrahman al-Sadhan and several other detainees. All the relatives interviewed said they hoped to retain their ties with Saudi Arabia, despite their decision to go public. None have reported any retaliation by Saudi authorities, though some, like Areej al-Sadhan, could not say how their relatives in detention detention were being treated. After the siblings of Loujain al-Hathloul, a women?s rights activist, began speaking publicly this year about her detention and allegations that she had been tortured, they were met with harsh criticism that they were damaging Saudi Arabia?s image abroad. Before talking to the media, ?we addressed all the competent authorities, and we did not receive receive any response,? Hathloul?s sister, Alia al-Hathloul, wrote on Twitter in March, responding to a Saudi journalist who accused the family of spreading lies about prison abuse. Downplaying the allegations of torture is ?not in the interest of Bowser administration officials officials say the mayor?s new emphasis emphasis on middle-income housing does not come at the expense of existing programs: The mayor has proposed increasing annual funding for the Housing Production Production Trust Fund, which caters to low-income residents, to $130 million from the current $100 million.

She was careful not to criticize the government, arguing instead that someone in law enforcement might be breaking breaking their own rules. Saudi officials have denied torturing torturing any of the detainees. In speaking out, relatives have also been thrust into an unfamiliar unfamiliar role as advocates. Alia, a working mother of two who lives in Brussels, has a day job at an energy company. Areej alSadhan alSadhan works at a technology company. ?I have never been an activist,? she said. A decade ago, before she left Saudi Arabia and moved to the United States, she had been supportive of giving women the right to drive. But in California, ?I stopped following the politics of Saudi Arabia. I focused on getting my master?s degree, on my life. Now I have to pay offers because we have a goodpaying goodpaying job. But we are still struggling struggling to make ends meet, quite frankly, for housing, transportation, transportation, child care, you name it.? ? That sentiment resonates with some of the middle-class workers the new fund aims to help. Yolanda Geter, who earns just over $75,000 per year as an emergency emergency services dispatcher for the D.C. government, is in the process of buying a home in Northeast Washington?s Deanwood neighborhood. neighborhood. But she said she could afford the $419,000 purchase price only with the help of firsttime firsttime home buyer programs for city employees and is anticipating cutting back on basic living expenses expenses such as cable and phone plans. She said middle-class status ? at least in high-cost cities ? doesn?t mean what it once did. ?Most people, on paper, it appears appears that they can afford things that in fact they really can?t because because of the cost of living in this area,? Geter said. ?I guess they would call it middle class. But once you pay your bills, there?s not a whole lot left.? Madra Harden, a 35-year-old preschool teacher for D.C. Public Schools who earns a salary of attention, to what changed ? what happened there,? she said. Ahmad Fitaihi, 26, was in the coastal city of Jiddah, mulling his future, when the authorities arrested arrested his father, Walid Fitaihi, the founder of a prominent hospital, hospital, in November 2017. The arrest occurred as the authorities rounded up hundreds hundreds of business executives, government government officials and some members of the royal family and imprisoned them at the RitzCarlton RitzCarlton hotel in Riyadh, the Saudi Saudi capital. ?We tried to appeal to the government. We tried all the intermediaries,? said Fitaihi, who like his father, holds dual Saudi and U.S. citizenship. ?We did everything privately in order not to make a fuss,? he said. Lawyers were not able to visit his father, he said, and no charges were filed. After Fitaihi received reabout reabout $72,000, said the city?s high home prices drove her and her husband to move to Maryland when they began having children several years ago. The median home price in the District was $570,000 in 2018, according to Bright MLS. ?I?ve found that when you have small kids, it goes quickly,? Harden Harden said. ?I?m from Arkansas, and the cost of living is just so much cheaper than here.? Experts say the shortage of affordable urban homes for the middle class has been aggravated in recent years as developers have focused on pricey condos and luxury apartments and turned away from the kind of modest houses and low-rise apartment buildings that have historically been the starter homes of middleincome middleincome workers. ?A lot of that?s just gone away,? said Christopher Ptomey, executive executive director at the Terwilliger Center for Housing at the Urban Land Institute. ?Most of the development development over the last decade has been focused on the luxury end.? Federal housing programs, meanwhile, offer generous tax credits and other incentives for the development of low-income ports early last year that his father was being tortured, ?my hand was forced,? he said. He eventually agreed to give interviews to the news media, contacted members of the U.S. Congress and even testified on Capitol Hill. Saudi friends and relatives ?told me not to do it.

The families speak out with no guarantee that publicity is an effective strategy. But at the very least, their tactics appear to have increased pressure on the Saudi leadership. The Trump administration administration said it has repeatedly raised the issue of Walid Fitaihi?s imprisonment with the Saudi government. And U.S. lawmakers, lawmakers, swayed by the testimony of housing. That has left some local government officials seeking to shore up what they say is a gap in the middle of the market. ?If you?re a two-person household household ? somebody?s making $40,000, somebody?s making $35,000, y?all got a bunch of kids ? you can?t find a place to live in Boston,? said Chrystal Kornegay, executive director of the Massachusetts Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency, Agency, which over the past several years has spent or committed more than $70 million for housing housing for those making 61 to 120 percent of area median income. ?It?s a shame that the market can?t figure out how to serve them, but what does that mean?? The Philadelphia Redevelopment Redevelopment Authority announced in February that it was expanding an incentive program for middleincome middleincome housing. Last month, California California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) included $200 million for middle-class middle-class homes in a $750 million package of proposals to address the state?s affordable-housing crisis. crisis. Such proposals have not been welcomed in all quarters. Matt Schwartz, president and chief executive of the California Housing Partnership, said a recent recent analysis by the nonprofit group showed that 76 percent of extremely low-income households households in the state pay more than half their income toward housing costs, compared with 4 percent of moderate-income households. Diverting money from low-income low-income housing to help the middle class ?is a bad policy choice,? Schwartz said. ?It may be good politics because you have a lot of voters that are struggling to afford afford the homes they want in the moderate-income category. But those people have choices, generally.? generally.? In the District, that skepticism is shared even by some of the middle-income workers the mayor mayor says she wants to help.

The defense made two errors and could have been charged with a third. The offense flatlined in the middle innings, one batter after another, but the Nationals would come out on top anyway.

Is that possible? — Mac Coinich, Annandale In the summer of 1950, Washingtonians were excited about a new 4,000-seat performance space set to open. Its name: the Sesquicentennial Amphitheater, “Sesqui” for short. Doesn’t really roll off the tongue, does it? You probably know it by a different name: Carter Barron Amphitheatre. It was Carter T. Barron, the Washington representative of the Loews Theater chain, who spearheaded construction of the outdoor venue. Barron was executive vice chairman of the National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission, formed to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of Washington as the nation’s capital. Many ideas were proposed to celebrate Washington’s sesquicentennial, but the only one to get off the ground — or on the ground — was the amphitheater constructed in a natural bowl in Rock Creek Park near 16th Street NW and Colorado Avenue. Playwright Paul Green (1894-1981) was commissioned to create a piece christening it. Green “really was on the cutting edge of all kind of things. And he was terribly bold,” said John Roper, author of the 2003 biography “Paul Green, Playwright of the Real South.” A white North Carolinian, Landmark status could reduce new project s size BARRY FARM FROM Cl poor and blighted area. The District Housing Authority Authority has already relocated nearly 200 families that lived at Barry Farm Dwellings to make way for the redevelopment and demolished demolished more than 30 of the complex’s complex’s two-story buildings. The developer was forced to hold off on razing 32 remaining buildings after the nomination to landmark Barry Farm was submitted in April. Opponents of the historic designation say the proponents are using the nomination nomination process to create another hurdle for the development — a contention the advocates deny. At a time when developers are transforming neighborhoods across the city, those who favor landmarking Barry Farm argue it is essential to enshrine symbols of black culture in the District, including remnants of a public housing complex once regarded as among the city’s more violent. “We’re losing so much of our history,” said Parisa Norouzi, executive executive director of Empower DC, a grass-roots organization lobbying lobbying to landmark Barry Farm. “Our humble history is as important important as our grand history.” Greta Fuller, a founding member member of the Historic Anacostia Preservation Society, describes herself as a supporter of the redevelopment project, but she said the remaining buildings should be saved “to tell the story” of Barry Farm, from its 19th-century 19th-century origins through its more notorious recent past, a story that she regards as intrinsic to the broader history of Washington.

Nor is she bothered that the surviving public housing units — built during World War II — no longer look the same and are now largely uninhabitable. More than a plaque is needed to commemorate Barry Farm’s past, she said. “If you wipe it out, if you bring it all down, how many people are really going to get the feeling and understand?” she asked. “There’s something about walking through a structure and feeling that structure. How many people walk by plaques without reading them?” Referring to the violence that often defined Barry Farm in more recent years, she said the complex’s troubled history should be included in any commemoration. commemoration. “Sometimes we need to tell the story of the uncomfortableness to show how we have grown and where we are OSCAR L.

Green was a devoted integrationist, the perfect choice for a theater that, because it was on federal land, was required to be integrated. His Pulitzer Prizewinning Prizewinning 1927 play “In Abraham’s Bosom” is about an African American field worker eager to open a school for black children. Green had spent time in Europe and collaborated with Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya. He’d made good money in movies, too, penning the screenplay for 1932’s “The Cabin in the Cotton,” in which Bette Davis delivers the immortal line “I’d like to kiss you, but I just washed my hair.” But Green had tired of Broadway and Hollywood and was eager to find a new way to connect with audiences.

Robinette Woodland, a local Advisory Neighborhood Commission Commission member whose aunt lived at Barry Farm, said she agrees that the developer should honor the site’s 19th-century history. history. Woodland, 45, a telephone technician whose brother is Will Harvey, dismissed the notion of preserving buildings that are a reminder “of all the murders that took place over there, the drivebys drivebys and the drug dealing.” “They need to be torn down,” she said. “Why would we want to keep that? Let’s let it go. Let’s move on.” “There’s something about walking through a structure and feeling that structure. How many people walk by plaques without reading them?” Greta Fuller, a founding member of the Historic Anacostia Preservation Society Redeveloping Barry Farm On a Wednesday night earlier this month, Ronette Slamin, a senior project manager overseeing overseeing the Barry Farm redevelopment, redevelopment, told a Ward 8 audience that the developer planned to incorporate art exhibits, oral histories histories and path markers, among other things, to celebrate the property’s history. But preserving the buildings that are the focus of the landmark landmark nomination is virtually impossible impossible because of disrepair, she said. In a Power Point presentation, presentation, she showed photos of suridea: suridea: a genre he called “symphonic drama.” These would be large productions that explored and celebrated aspects of U.S. history and were mounted in the very places where that history took place. “The Lost Colony” debuted in Manteo, N.C., in 1937 and continues to this day, only ceasing operations during World War II when it was feared the theater lights might attract German submarines. “The Common Glory” in Williamsburg opened in 1947 and ran for 30 years. For Washington the city, Green chose as his subject Washington the man. The show was called “Faith of Our Fathers” — or “FOOF,” as newspaper headline writers quickly dubbed it — and viving units with mold and gaping gaping holes in walls. “The history is in the stories, not in the buildings in their current conditions,” said Slamin, of Preservation of Affordable Housing, a development company company working with A&R Development Development on the project. Her remarks prompted Ronald Ronald Thompson, 21, who described himself as a grass-roots organizer, organizer, to stand and accuse the developer of disrespecting the community by dismissing the buildings — no matter their condition. condition. “A space where people live is where people build their stories,” Thompson said, later adding: “History is in those stories. But history is also in those buildings. You wouldn’t say that to a white person in Dupont Circle.” Barry Farm has been a potent symbol of African American life in Washington since 1867 when the Freedmen’s Bureau bought 375 acres of Julia and David Barry’s tobacco farm to sell parcels parcels to blacks migrating from plantations. The profits helped fund African American institutions institutions such as Howard University. Within a few years, hundreds of black families — Frederick Douglass’s three sons, among them — were living at Barry Farm, creating what the District’s District’s Historic Preservation Office Office recently described as a “thriving, self-contained African American community.” Facing a shortage of affordable housing in the early 1940s, the federal government built more than 400 units of public housing at Barry Farm, the largest subsidized subsidized development at the time. Until the developer began demolishing demolishing Barry Farm last year, the buildings remained, though their exteriors were refaced and porches removed during a massive massive 1980s renovation that District District officials cite to argue against a landmark designation. it covered George Washington’s public life from 1783 to 1798. Many in the cast and crew of 120 were taken from the theater departments of local universities. (Also in the show, as Pierre L’Enfant, was Pernell Roberts, who later starred in “Bonanza” and “Trapper John, MD.”) The show opened on Aug. 4, 1950, with President Harry S. Truman in the audience. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times was among those underwhelmed by Green’s play. “The inspiration it seeks to convey is dissipated amid a clutter of quick, posterlike posterlike episodes and laborious changes of scenery,” he wrote. The hometown crowd was just as critical. “Impressive but disappointing” was the verdict of The Washington Post’s Richard While “directly associated with the development of public housing for African Americans during World War II — a significant significant event in the urban planning architecture and social history of the District — the buildings do not retain sufficient integrity to convey the values and qualities for which the property is judged significant,” the Historic Preservation Preservation Office wrote to the review panel in June. Nevertheless, Derek Hyra, an American University public administration administration and policy professor, professor, said Barry Farm — even its vestiges — has grown in significance significance over time as the city’s black population has declined and lost political power in the District. The debate over Barry Farm, as well as other historically black neighborhoods, has “become a battle ground to preserve the legacy of African Americans in this city,” said Hyra, who has studied gentrification of the U Street corridor and Shaw. “How do you upgrade the area while keeping the historical legacy? If you do that, it minimizes the cultural displacement. I’m not sure the city is thinking about that.” In addition to housing the poor, Barry Farm over the years became known for hosting the Goodman Basketball League during summers, which has drawn large crowds and visits from NBA stars such as Kevin Durant. The complex also earned a reputation for blight and violence. violence. On Christmas Eve morning morning in 2013, as a television news crew filmed, someone fired a pellet gun at a man dressed as Santa Claus, striking him in the back during an annual toy giveaway. giveaway. By then, the District had included included Barry Farm in its New Communities initiative, a plan to break up concentrated poverty by redeveloping public housing projects as mixed-income communities communities with retail and other amenities. The plan to redevelop Barry Farm suffered a setback last year when the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated a zoning commission approval of the project, contending contending that the panel had not given adequate consideration to the potential displacement of residents. residents. As the development team reworked reworked its plan, a group of former tenants, aided by Empower Empower DC, filed the nomination to landmark the remaining Barry Farm buildings. Under the current proposal, about 1,100 units of mixed-income mixed-income housing would be built, including 380 units of public housing to replace the 444 units L. Coe, who wrote: “To fill his huge stage, [Green’s] scenes must be broad and heavy, the very qualities he at the same time is trying to tone down in his central figure.” Coe did praise the lighting, by James Waring, and the music, especially the chorus led by Washington National Cathedral’s Richard Dirksen. Green was known to tinker with his creations and that was true of “Faith of Our Fathers.” When the play returned for its second season in 1951, the author promised “a different attitude.” He told Coe: “We have a new beginning and a new ending. The action now starts when Washington was 27 years old and carries him through 40 years until the laying of the Capitol cornerstone.” Green added more “Indian ritual dances,” choreographed by Myra Kinch, as well as scenes from the battle of Lexington and Washington’s inauguration. The space had a new name, too, in honor of Barron, who the previous November had died of a brain tumor at age 45. Alas, the changes didn’t help. Ticket sales never achieved the desired level. Plus, residents near the amphitheater complained about the “noise and dust” of the show. “Faith of Our Fathers” closed after its second season and never came back. But over the ensuing decades, Carter Barron Amphitheatre did host all manner of entertainments. Deferred maintenance closed it in 2017.

Anthony Anthony Waddell, a vice president for development at Preservation of Affordable Housing, declined requests to talk about the project. project. Designating the remaining 32 buildings a landmark would limit limit what could be built and “drastically” “drastically” reduce the project’s affordable affordable housing units, said Angie Angie Rogers, a senior Bowser adviser adviser overseeing the project. It would also diminish the number of family-sized apartments, she said. The timing of the landmark nomination — six years after the Housing Authority picked the development team — has fueled suggestions that proponents are using the process to seek leverage leverage for demands that include additional public housing units. “It’s just another form of trying trying to stop progress,” said Rhonda Rhonda Edwards-Hines, president of the Barry Farm Resident Council and a supporter of the redevelopment redevelopment project. “Why didn’t they do this earlier? Now that they see it’s coming to pass, that the buildings are going to come up, now they’re trying to stop it.” Detrice Belt, a former Barry Farm resident and a leader of the campaign to landmark the remaining remaining buildings, denied that the nomination was a delay tactic tactic and said she only learned in recent months that seeking historic historic status was an option. “We’re just getting the facts in and learning to do everything,” she said on a recent Saturday as Empower DC organizers and the historians led the tour of Barry Farm. Along the way, the tour guides pointed out that Barry Farm’s former residents included prominent prominent tenant and school desegregation desegregation activists, as well as musician musician Herb Feemster, of Peaches and Herb, whose hits included “Reunited” and “Shake Your Groove Thing.” In 1967, they said, Black Panther Stokely Carmichael Carmichael convened a meeting of community organizers at Barry Farm.

If they erase this, it will change the look and feel of Southeast.” Will Harvey said he was more concerned about whether former Barry Farm families would return return to the property than saving buildings, the sight of which he said still “causes me some kind of euphoria — and makes me think about a lot of stuff.” “You don’t want to think about it,” he said, “but it’s there.” paul.schwartzman @ washpost. com LOCAL DIGEST MARYLAND Man dies after assault at fair in Frederick A 59-year-old man died after being assaulted in an unprovoked attack at a fair in Frederick, the county sheriff’s office said.

Except JASON BITTEL they don’t, really. — In the wild, rabbits aren’t in the habit of digging up root vegetables such as carrots, potatoes and beets. They much prefer wild greens, such as grasses and clover. In fact, carrots may actually be bad for rabbits, because although the vegetables are high in good nutrients, including beta carotene, they are also relatively high in sugar.

DESMOND FUSARELLI, 7, ARLINGTON or other health issues. But this is just one common myth about the diets of wild animals. Here’s another: Bears are bloodthirsty predators that regularly stalk and kill prey. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. “While we do see bears feeding on elk and bison and things like that, most of those animals actually just didn’t survive the winter, or they were wolf kills,” said Danielle Rivet, a wildlife biologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. Rivet says black bears and brown bears in the United States and The cast of “Jitney,” playing at Arena Stage through Oct. 20. The play is full of comedy — and themes including gentrification and economic and psychological oppression of the black community. Hailing the work of August Wilson in the down-to-earth and gritty ‘Jitney’ JOAN MARCUS/ARENA STAGE THEATER FROM Cl trigger Turnbo (Ray Anthony Thomas) has his nose ceaselessly in everyone else’s business; Shealy (Harvy Blanks), the local numbers runner, is too slick not to get on Becker’s nerves and Chisholm’s Fielding liquors up between fares. “Jitney” is occupied with recurring recurring Wilson themes: the gradual gentrification of the Hill District; the economic and psychological oppression that weighs down and sometimes divides the black community. community. Santiago-Hudson, a Tony winner for his own performance in Wilson’s “Seven Guitars,” understands understands that “Jitney” is a character-driven piece, despite the involved subplots. The stories of Youngblood and Rena, and Becker and his ex-con son Booster Booster (Francois Battiste) dominate the evening, but the success of the play depends on our grasping an ineffable, collective dependency among the cabdrivers. Their livelihoods livelihoods are tenuous, and even the physical domain they share is perishable, with the city harboring harboring plans to tear the block down. Underlying the tensions is a powerful powerful bond forged on the edge of tempau/getty images desperation. David Gallo’s set fits impressively impressively in the Kreeger Theater; it’s a facsimile of the design he used in the Broadway production, shabby down to the grimy walls and broken linoleum floor — a ruinsin-progress. ruinsin-progress. Jane Cox’s lighting design includes some lovely touches that ease us across the breaks in the action, and Toni-Leslie Toni-Leslie James has an infallible eye for the style of the ’70s, especially in the flashy crayon-colored suits for Shealy. Jazzy underscoring by Bill Sims Jr. completes the sense of mature conception. Santiago-Hudson’s achievement achievement on Broadway with “Jitney” was to confirm that Wilson in a lighter vein did not mean Wilson Lite. Elements of the tragic do assert themselves in “Jitney,” but all in all, the play demonstrates the playwright’s mastery of comedy comedy better than any other play in the cycle.

This can include dandelions and grasses, as well as blueberries, strawberries and huckleberries, depending on what’s in season. Grizzlies, which are a type of brown bear, also like to spend their days turning over rocks in search of army cutworm moths. In other areas, such as Yellowstone National Park, the bears may sniff around for a red squirrel’s secret stash of pine nuts. “So the bears aren’t actually just going around and murdering things all the time,” said Rivet. “They’ll eat anything. Mosses, fungus, they’ll eat mushrooms. Bears aren’t picky.” Many people know that the bears of Alaska get a lot of calories each year from salmon. But did you know bruins also enjoy other types of seafood? “These bears will actually go out into the tidal plains when the tide is out, and they’ll dig up clams,” said Rivet. “Loads of clams. Loads of moths. They have to eat tons and tons of these things to actually gain enough weight to get ready for winter.” Aside from bears and rabbits, plenty of other animals eat things we don’t typically associate with their kind. Squirrels, which, of course, love acorns and nuts, also create a sort of mushroom jerky by hanging fungi on tree branches so it can dry out. Pandas, which are infamous bamboo eaters, will nibble on rotting carcasses if they get the chance. Deer have been known to gobble up baby birds from time to time. And only half of all mosquitoes drink blood. (It’s the females — they need the protein so they can produce eggs.)

1075,2329387250,"LOCAL OPINIONS WASHINGTONPOST.COM/LOCALOPINIONS • LOCALOPINIONS@WASHINGTONPOST.COM The reasoning behind Virginia’s work requirements by Brent Merritt T he debate over Virginia’s Medicaid work requirements requirements has heated back up as Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Republican legislative leaders butt heads over funding job-search services included included in the original Medicaid expansion compromise. Meanwhile, a new analysis suggests that implementing work requirements could kick as many as 74,000 Virginians Virginians off the program’s rolls. Beyond the policy implications, implications, I can attest from personal experience that the prospect of losing coverage because of these restrictions is terrifying. In 2018,1 faced complex medical issues that curtailed my ability to work and reduced my earnings. When Medicaid expansion passed last year, I was thrilled to learn that my income at the time would make me eligible for the program. Then I was alarmed to discover that I couldn’t meet Republican legislators’ requirement for hours worked per month and that my condition might not qualify me for a disability waiver. Had my health not improved, I likely would have ended up locked out of my best and perhaps only health coverage option. While convalescing, I had ample time to reflect on why our Republican representatives seem so uncomfortable providing help to the people who need it most. In the case of work requirements, they claim their objectives are to encourage financial independence and to prevent ablebodied ablebodied deadbeats from abusing the system. As Sen. Frank W. Wagner (R-Virginia Beach) stated, the requirements target people “who could be working and choose not to. ... I shouldn’t ask other people out there to pay for their lifestyle.” This reasoning suffers from two flaws. The first is that threatening people’s access to vital social support programs programs doesn’t help them find steady work. Research indicates previous welfare work requirements for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program sanctioned sanctioned vulnerable participants but didn’t improve longterm longterm employment outcomes. The second problem with this logic is that trying to live on a low income in the United States is a brutally difficult experience. The idea that otherwise-able people choose not to work so they can luxuriate in this country’s haphazard-at-best social safety net is ludicrous. Beyond such barely plausible justifications, where might this apparent obsession with work and disdain toward the less fortunate come from? There’s a compelling compelling explanation that harks back to the nation’s original colonial workaholics. These conservative viewpoints sound eerily similar to the Calvinist religious values that Puritan settlers brought to America, which by many accounts continue to influence morality in our country. Max Weber, in his quintessential treatise on Calvinist theology and capitalism, “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,” explains that the Puritans’ religious doctrine and social code were shaped by their core belief in predestination. In their view, an individual’s ultimate salvation or damnation was predetermined by God, and there was nothing anyone could do to change it. Despite this immutability, and contrary to John Calvin’s instruction instruction on the matter, Puritans looked for outward signs of who was among the favored elect. According to Weber, “tireless labor in a calling” was the key indicator of an individual’s state of grace. Conversely, “unwillingness to work” and “idleness” were signs of spiritual inferiority. Puritans also expected the elect would be blessed with material success on Earth, so the accretion of wealth was viewed as a sign of God’s favor. As a result of these beliefs, there wasn’t much room in Puritan society for empathy for people who, for whatever reason, were less productive or not as well off. In fact, because more fortunate members of society were certain of their spiritual superiority, the proper attitude toward their less fortunate, and therefore supposedly sinful, neighbors was “hatred and contempt for them as enemies enemies of God.” This attitude didn’t encourage acts of mutual social support. Puritans viewed fulfilling their duties to God as their only charitable commitment and felt no particular obligation to provide for the well-being of other people. In this system, Weber observed, “The ‘humanity’ of relationships to one’s ‘neighbor’ is, so to speak, dead.” I find it oddly comforting that our Republican legislators’ legislators’ views on who deserves assistance might be informed informed by our shared Puritan moral heritage rather than simply a wanton disregard for people who are struggling. Nevertheless, you wouldn’t know the difference from their policies. Puritan theology may have created fertile ground for capitalist economic success, as Weber claimed, but atavistic atavistic moralizing about labor, wealth and intrinsic individual individual worth is a terrible basis for shaping our modern health-care system. We should ensure that everyone in Virginia has unrestricted access to high-quality healthcare healthcare coverage that is not based on his or her economic output because we recognize the equal human value of every person in our community.

Smith T he gentrification of District District neighborhoods — forcing existing residents, residents, mostly people of color, out and creating new, amenity-rich amenity-rich areas for generally white and wealthy newcomers — is not a force of its own. It is not the natural order of things. It is the result of conscious policy decisions. decisions. There is a long, well-documented well-documented history of legal housing discrimination in the District. Post-Civil War seizures of blackowned blackowned land to create parks and roads, restrictive covenants, mortgage redlining and urban renewal displaced African American American communities and maintained racial segregation. We do not need to look to history, however. The current wave of gentrification gentrification that is breaking up black communities, increasing inequality inequality and enhancing segregation finds its roots in policies initiated in recent years. Despite the District’s financial crisis, at the end of the last century, century, mixed-race and mixed-income mixed-income neighborhoods were more common. From 1980 to 2000, racial racial integration of the District was increasing. Now what integration exists is largely temporary in rapidly rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods. In the early 2000s, in an effort to bring more tax income into the city’s coffers, policies were set in motion that led to the crisis we are facing today. In April 2003, then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) announced a plan to attract Maryland judges are skirting state law by Andrea Conte W hen Judge W. Michel Pierson Pierson ordered an illegal shutdown on public access to Baltimore courtroom recordings earlier this year, the strikedown strikedown of his order exposed deeper problems in Maryland law that have restricted the freedom of the press for decades. Public access to copies of courtroom courtroom recordings is state-mandated under Maryland Rule 16-504(h). Trialcourt Trialcourt recordings are vivid historical records that allow public hearings to be relived, as they occurred. Their use in podcasts and documentaries has been central to the changing cultural landscape of how stories about law and the justice system are created, communicated and consumed by the public. Recordings from Baltimore criminal criminal cases have been featured in some of the most popular podcasts ever, such as “Serial” and “Undisclosed.” These shows are in many ways responsible responsible for the shift toward “serialized” and series-based formats in radio, film and television and for the global revival revival of the investigative “true crime” genre. What is not commonly known is that when news outlets, documentaries documentaries or podcasts use Maryland courtroom courtroom recordings in their storytelling, their creators are violating Section 1-201 of Maryland’s Code of Criminal Procedure and could be held in contempt contempt of court. In 1981, the Maryland General Assembly Assembly enacted legislation to ban the “recording or broadcasting” of any criminal court proceeding. Although the ban remains in effect, the state has never enforced it. The penalty for violating violating the ban, to be “held in contempt of court,” has remained undefined for nearly 40 years. With a federal lawsuit now challenging challenging the Maryland broadcast ban for the first time, multiple incidents of media outlets brushing up against the ban were documented in the lead-up to Pierson’s unlawful court order. In 2016, Pierson publicly considered considered the producers of “Serial” to be in contempt of court for playing audio of criminal trial proceedings on their show; in March of this year, Pierson sent a letter to HBOto demand it cease the broadcast of audio/video footage Redistrictim* reform must continue in Virginia by Stephen J. Farnsworth and Kate Seltzer O ne of the biggest questions in Virginia politics these days is whether the proposed constitutional constitutional amendment to block partisan gerrymandering will ever get to the voters. If Republicans lose their narrow majorities in the House of Delegates and the Senate next month, Democrats Democrats will have complete control of drawing the lines for legislative districts districts following the 2020 Census. If thathappens, would Democrats abandon abandon efforts that seemed so appealing when they were in the minority? As Richmond has grown increasingly increasingly to reflect the partisan trench warfare found in Washington, there might be little interest in unilateral disarmament. Democrats, who have not held complete control of the redistricting redistricting process since just after the 1990 Census, might not want to give up something they have sought for so long.

On April 24, two days after the new season of “Undisclosed” aired, and while journalist Justine Barron was attempting to access recordings of trial trial proceedings for the 2015 death murder murder of Freddie Gray, Pierson issued a blanket ban on access to recordings, with no explanation. Instead of holding anyone in contempt contempt of court for broadcasting court recordings, Pierson cut off the media’s ability to access those recordings as source material. Barron sued, and in a September judicial decision, Pierson’s order — issued issued under an exception clause — was deemed invalid because a blanket ban on public access to audio recordings would nullify Rule 16-504(h) itself. Pierson’s attempt to ban access to copies of courtroom recordings is not isolated. Since his order was issued in not trivial. Recent redistricting cycles demonstrate that, on average, the ability to shape districts can increase a majority party’s margin by six seats or more in the 100-member House of Delegates and an additional seat or two in the 40-member Senate. A resolution calling for a constitutional constitutional amendment to establish an independent independent redistricting commission passed in 2019, and the measure will be before lawmakers again in 2020. If it’s approved a second time next winter, winter, voters could decide whether to adopt the amendment later that year, just in time for the 2021 redistricting process that would follow the 2020 Census. Depending on what happens Nov. 5, that might be a big if. A new statewide statewide poll conducted in September by Research America Inc. for the University University of Mary Washington suggests that supporters of this proposed constitutional constitutional amendment have not been effective effective in promoting it to residents of the commonwealth. The UMW poll last month asked 1,009 residents whether they favored vate investment that causes housing housing costs to rise dramatically. Keeping with the goal of increasing increasing tax revenue, new amenities were created for wealthier new residents. Little to nothing was targeted to benefit those who had lived in the communities for generations. generations. They were simply expected expected to get out of the way. Families have been deeply hit by the resulting crisis. In rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods, family-size family-size rental housing has been replaced with smaller units. Housing cost pressures have driven driven working and poor families out while richer and mostly white singles and young couples have moved in. Families are forced to move to more remote and segregated segregated parts of the District. Displacement interferes with April, at least one other Maryland judge, SheilaTillerson Adams in Prince George’s County, issued an equivalent order to ban access under the exception exception clause. When looking to history, administrative judges have used the exception clause of16-504(h) as a loophole loophole to skirt the rule since its inception on July 1,2005. Just days before, on June 27, the administrative judge of the Charles County Circuit Court of Maryland, Robert Nalley, preemptively nullified the rule, issuing a local order that banned public access to courtroom recordings. Nearly 14 years later, in March of this year, when the author cited Rule 16-504(h) to request copies of audio recordings of courtroom proceedings in Charles County, it was Nalley’s 2005 court order that was referenced by the court administrator to deny access. No rationale for the order was provided. provided. What the administrator failed to mention was that in September 2014, the Maryland Court of Appeals banned Nalley from the bench after he ordered a bailiff to use a 50,000-volt taking the power to draw legislative lines away from the state legislature or not. Respondents deadlocked: 42 percent favored the constitutional amendment, 40 percent opposed it and the rest were undecided. Despite all the attention the topic received in Richmond last winter, the 2019 survey results were not much different from previous polls. A statewide statewide survey by UMW in September 2018, for example, revealed that 40 percent favored the constitutional amendment and 45 percent opposed the idea. As Republican legislative majorities majorities have shriveled, and as the party has lost a series of statewide elections, it has become more supportive of anti-gerrymandering legislation. New Democratic majorities, if they emerge, might use this divided public opinion as justification for hitting the brakes on creating an independent line-drawing process. They could kill the measure at an early-morning committee or subcommittee or propose propose a different anti-gerrymandering amendment, which would push the economic opportunity and sustains sustains income inequality. Workers who are forced out of neighborhoods neighborhoods with access to transportation transportation to a more remote corner of the city find it harder and costlier to get to work. Low-wage work can have unpredictable hours, making reliable and efficient transportation essential. Access to opportunities for employment is among the most effective strategies strategies to lift families out of poverty and create other opportunities for social mobility. Had the District District taken into account the racial justice impact of its decisions regarding economic development development and housing policy, we could have had a very different outcome. Without question, the neighborhoods neighborhoods the District targeted for stun cuff to electrically shock a defendant defendant for speaking out of turn in his courtroom. A courtroom recording of the incident incident was not made public until federal prosecutors charged Nalley with violating violating the civil rights of the defendant, eight months later. When the victim later sued Nalley for damages, his complaint was dismissed because Nalley’s actions were protected by “judicial “judicial immunity.” While Maryland judges might not be liable for damages caused by unlawful unlawful acts of extreme violence they’ve ordered while on the job, the recordings recordings of what happens in their courtrooms courtrooms are public records under state law. Rights to court recordings should never be altered by a judge’s ploy to deny access to the media or to shield the public from what happens in their courtrooms. No exceptions. Andrea Conte, a writer, researcher and filmmaker, is suing the Charles County Circuit Court of Maryland for denying a request to access copies of courtroom recordings and for denying a request to listen to courtroom recordings. calendar for final approval of the replacement replacement amendment beyond the 2021 redistricting deadline. Although a new Democratic majority majority might be tempted to keep that power for its own use, that would undermine its long-term commitment commitment to greater citizen empowerment. empowerment. The idea behind an independent independent redistricting commission is to ensure ensure a more inclusive and transparent process, as well as more competitive elections. Politicians of both parties have gerrymandered to their advantage advantage decade after decade. That selfdealing selfdealing process has to stop. Democratic candidates routinely promise governance based on principle, principle, and they should stick to that commitment. They can, and should, do better for Virginians than their predecessors — of both parties — have done. Stephen!.

48,2360129989,"Home Appreciating the beautiful — and necessary — urban forest Adrian Higgins GARDENING In the leafy Connecticut Avenue corridor of Northwest Washington, big old street trees are saying a slow farewell to a growing season that began too wet, turned too dry and ended too cold. Some 60-foot oaks attest to years — even decades — of knowing such stressful conditions in tight root boxes, and they should be admired for their survival skills alone. I say a slow farewell because this year many trees seems to be reluctant to let go of their leaves. Brown, shriveled leaves will often cling to oaks and beeches, but I’m talking about trees where the entire mantel of foliage remains firmly attached as we approach mid-December, albeit in fall coloration. Sonja Diimpelmann, a landscape historian at the University of Pennsylvania, was recently in her native Germany and noticed the same phenomenon while she was riding the train to Weimar. When she joined me recently to look at street trees in Cleveland Park, we found the leaves still clinging — in the case of a sweetgum, they were just changing from green to yellow. What gives, we asked? Neither of us knew, but we live in strange times when shifting natural cycles seem bound up with unpredictable patterns of weather and climate. One thing seems certain: The need for street trees is only going to get greater. They shade, they cool, they grab carbon from the atmosphere. Oh, and they can be beautiful if spared the butchery of life with the aerial power line. A 2015 study confirmed what we might have already known — people who live in the shelter of mature trees are healthier than folks in neighborhoods that don’t have them. Even before the age of climate change, the value of the urban forest was understood, first in an aesthetic sense and later, with industrialization and urbanization, systematically and scientifically. Diimpelmann tracks the history of the modern street tree in her book “Seeing Trees,” a deep, scholarly dive into urban society’s need for — and relationship with — trees that sought to return the natural world to the concrete jungle. Her focus is on two great sylvan cities — New York and Berlin — but she gives a nod too to Washington, the first city in the United States ADRIAN HIGGINS/THE WASHINGTON POST Landscape historian Sonja Diimpelmann beholds the street tree, in life and in her book “Seeing Trees.” to implement a street tree planting program, she writes. By 1912, the capital had almost 280 miles of double plantings of street trees — approximately 100,000 trees and, crucially, a program of annual replacement. Around the same time, civicminded civicminded tree lovers in New York were pressing the city to create an urban forestry agency to plant and care for street trees, Diimpelmann writes, especially in poor and tenement neighborhoods in need of better sanitation. The effort was led by a physician, Stephen Smith, and other figures, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and financier J. Pierpont Morgan among them. Smith had written an influential paper equating the lack of trees and summer heat with childhood mortality. Today, the citizens and civic leaders of both Washington and New York embrace the urban forest with enthusiasm and resources. Public, private and nonprofit partnerships have led to a resurgence of tree planting. In New York, the city launched a program in 2007 to plant 1 million trees, a task that was finished in 2015. Trees were not always hugged like this. Older folks will remember the decline of American cities in the postwar decades, and in Washington, the city’s tree canopy withered as people abandoned the urban core for the suburbs. “Disinvestment” in communities, SEEING TREES/YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS The Neighborhood Tree Corps at work in Brooklyn in the 1970s. Diimpelmann says, “automatically meant disinvestment in the urban forest.” Now, ironically, the sprucing up of the streetscape often precedes the gentrification of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. “These are the big questions we need now to resolve,” she told me. “How do we see to it that everybody has access to nature and is not displaced when trees are planted?” Some of the most poignant Tip of the Week If you have spare refrigerator space, consider chilling tulip bulbs to force into early bloom in late winter. Triumph tulips are best for forcing. Set them in containers with potting soil, water and store in the fridge, not the freezer. After 12 weeks, bring the pot into a cool room to initiate growth. — Adrian Higgins images from the book are of treeplanting treeplanting efforts in Berlin and Kiel in the years after World War II, when both cities were still in ruins. One photo is of schoolboys planting saplings in Kiel in 1948 against the backdrop of a bombed-out building. The children and the young trees speak to a future being built out of a horrific immediate past. “That’s where you can become very emotional about the trees,” Diimpelmann says. “For me, if you see trees suffering you automatically think about human beings suffering also.” Other pictures show the replanting replanting of Berlin’s famous boulevard, Unter den Linden, against the backdrop of mountains of rubble. The avenue by then was in Soviet control. Many of the postwar trees declined before reunification and have since been re-planted. During the Cold War, the communist authorities created a model, tree-lined boulevard in East Berlin named Stalinallee, which became part of a greening competition between the city’s two camps. The East’s tree-planting frenzy of the early 1950s didn’t necessarily play out decades later in the form of a mature urban forest, though. Many died or declined as a result of excessive road salting and the use of gas lamps, which had the effect of poisoning plants. Street trees can be alarmingly short-lived, so the mature oaks on Connecticut Avenue deserve to be cherished. But it is uplifting, too, to see a number of young trees in Cleveland Park getting established — beyond the sapling stage and on their way to healthy adolescence. Diimpelmann seemed pleased by the abundance of street trees and their species diversity. “This isn’t scientifically proven,” she says. “But I think if people care about trees, they also tend to care about people.” adrian. higgins @ washpost.com @adrian_higgins on Twitter Also at washingtonpost.com Read past columns by Higgins at washingtonpost.com/home.",12/12/2019,"('often', 'precedes', 'the')","('low', 'and', 'moderateincome')","['” Now, ironically, the sprucing up of the streetscape often precedes the gentrification of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.']", Now ironically the sprucing up of the streetscape often precedes the gentrification of low and moderateincome neighborhoods

H ERE’S HOW the United States government works, according to the Constitution: Congress Congress debates various priorities and chooses how much to spend on each. The president either vetoes the appropriations bill or signs it. If he signs it, he and his subordinates use the funds as Congress instructed. This is not how things have been proceeding in the matter of President Trump’s pet anti-migrant project — a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress, by large bipartisan majorities, has voted for spending bills including far less wall money than Mr. Trump wants, and he has raided a military construction account to get the dollars, spuriously citing “emergency” “emergency” authority from other statutes. Mr. Trump got his hands on $3.6 billion in this manner during 2019, after failing, despite forcing a 35-day government shutdown roughly a year ago, to persuade Congress to supply $5.7 billion. Mr. Trump also rerouted $2.5 billion from a Defense Department counternarcotics fund and $600 million in Treasury Department funds, under slightly more plausible legal grounds. Now, The Post’s Nick Miroff reports that Mr. Trump plans to repeat this constitutionally dubious gambit in the current fiscal year, except diverting a slightly larger quantity of military construction funding — $3.7 billion. billion. Counternarcotics andTreasury money will alsobe tapped. This, despite the fact that Congress once again, in a spending bill Mr. Trump signed Dec. 20, limited border-barrier funding to $1,375 billion. The statute Mr. Trump is invoking was clearly intended to enable a president to redirect money among various military purposes in time of war or other security crisis, not to construct a permanent structure in response to a chronic issue in the civilian world such as cross-border migration and drug smuggling smuggling — even on the unlikely assumption that a wall would be effective against those. Opponents, including including the Democratic-majority House, have sued to stop the president from redirecting the funds, but both the Supreme Court and the New Orleans-based federal M USTAEA KASSEM, an auto-parts dealer from Bethpage, N.Y., was visiting his native native Egypt in August 2013 when he and his brother-in-law were stopped by a military patrol outside a shopping mall where they had been exchanging money. When the soldiers demanded the mens’ papers, Mr. Kassem, an American citizen, displayed his blue US. passport. That, it turned out, was a fatal mistake. “They allowed my brother-inlaw brother-inlaw to pass,” Mr. Kassem recounted in a letter to President Trump. “But I was treated differently. I was an American.” Mr. Kassem was arrested, badly beaten and locked up in the notorious Tora prison. On Monday, after more than six years of unconscionable mistreatment by Egyptian authorities, the 54-year-old father of two died. His only offense was to be a US. citizen in a country that receives $1.4 billion in annual US. aid — whose ruler, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, has been called “my favorite dictator” by Mr. Trump. The president has bragged about his successes in freeing Americans held abroad. In this case, the A Texas-size mistake Mr. Abbott turns his back on refugees - and state history. W ITH THE stroke of a pen, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has embraced moral myopia — specifically, contempt for the planet’s most vulnerable people. He did so by becoming the first governor to announce that his state would refuse to welcome even the scant number of legal, fully vetted refugees who would otherwise have settled there in the coming year. Whatever gain Mr. Abbott, a Republican, may have hoped for, either in currying favor with President President Trump, who has practically invited states and localities to shut their doors to refugees, or in pandering to the GOP’s most xenophobic voters, is outweighed by the dishonor he has called down upon his state. Texas would be a culturally, financially and politically diminished place if it somehow subtracted subtracted the decades of contributions by Mexican, German, German, Vietnamese and other immigrants, including refugees. By his action, Mr. Abbott has turned his back not just on a few hundred refugees, whose likely long-term success and assimilation in the Join the debate at washingtonpost.com/local-opinions LOCAL OPINIONS Room enough in NoMa for all I read the Jan. 12 Metro article “Advocates decry order to clear homeless from underpass” with anger and dismay. As a resident of NoMa who walks through the K Street underpass every day on my way to work, I am disappointed that Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s administration is permanently kicking my neighbors living in tents out of the area. While the encampments are not ideal for anyone, they are a symptom of an underlying system that is broken, and forcing people to leave with no housing alternatives alternatives will only make their situation worse. The trauma my neighbors will go through in having their access to shelter denied greatly outweighs my minor inconvenience of having a narrow walkway. It is important that we who live in NoMa acknowledge that there is a severe shortage of administration’s failure was abject. Vice President Pence raised Mr. Kassem’s plight with Mr. Sissi in January 2018, after he had been held for 414 years without trial. There was no result. In December, with Mr. Kassem’s health in peril after 15 months on a hunger strike, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought him up in a discussion with Egypt’s foreign minister. Again, Cairo ignored the appeal. What’s particularly striking is that the regime never offered any evidence whatsoever that Mr. Kassem Kassem had committed an offense. When he was finally brought to court, in September 2018, he was included included in a mass show trial of 738 defendants. No individualized evidence was ever presented against him. Yet he was sentenced to 15 years. Perhaps Mr. Kassem was kept in prison because the regime did not want to acknowledge that the soldiers who responded to his US. passport by beating and arresting him had acted wrongly. Perhaps he was seen as a useful subject for regime propaganda, according to which American “spies” are seeking to destabilize the country. We don’t TOM TOLES appeals court have permitted the wall construction to proceed, at least for now. Congress has options other than the courts. Federal law permits lawmakers to override Mr. Trump’s emergency emergency declaration, though effectively it would take a two-thirds majority of both houses to do it, because a presidential veto would have to be overcome. Last year, the House mustered 245 votes to cancel the emergency; emergency; the Senate got all the way to 59 votes, 12 of them Republican. But Mr. Trump vetoed the legislation, and the two chambers failed to override his action. If Mr. Trump proceeds again this year, House United States are strongly supported by experience, but on a few hundred years of Texas’s own history. The world is awash in forcibly displaced people — more than 70 million of them, the highest number in nearly seven decades of tracking by the U.N.’s refugee agency; every day, an estimated 37,000 people are displaced and forced to flee their homes around the world. But by Mr. Abbott’s reckoning, the Lone Star State has done enough and is now all tuckered out. “Texas has carried out more than its share in assisting the refugee resettlement process,” he said. Even if unemployment in Texas were sky-high, accepting a few hundred refugees would be the right thing to do. But the truth is that Texas, with nearly 30 million people, had among the fastest-growing economies in the United States last year, the result being a rock-bottom unemployment rate. The state’s acute labor shortage in construction, oil and other industries is regarded as a grave threat to its economy. If Texas were an independent country, its $1.6 trillion economy, roughly the size of Russia’s, would be the planet’s lOth-largest. Absorbing the affordable housing in the District and that the gentrification of this neighborhood and others like it has made that problem worse. Those of us fortunate enough to be able to live in fancy new apartment buildings have an obligation to advocate for real solutions. My ideal NoMa neighborhood is not a pictureperfect pictureperfect corporate utopia but rather a community that is inclusive, accessible and welcoming to all. I urge Ms. Bowser to treat all people living in NoMa with compassion and dignity, and to stop these dehumanizing “out of sight, out of mind” policies in favor of solutions that provide better alternatives for those living in encampments while addressing the root causes of homelessness. Miranda Ehrlich, Washington know, and the Trump administration doesn’t know, because Mr. Sissi and his jailers never offered a credible explanation. Far from earning protection through his US. citizenship, Mr. Kassem was subjected to shocking mistreatment. Though he was a diabetic with a heart condition, authorities restricted his access to medication medication throughout his imprisonment. Yet Mr. Trump has had nothing to say about this deadly abuse by a nominal ally. The only administration comment to date came from the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, David Schenker, who said Mr. Kassem’s death was “needless, tragic and avoidable,” avoidable,” but did not assign responsibility for it. Congress anticipated cases such as this when it passed the Magnitsky Act, named for a Russian lawyer who was persecuted by the government of Vladimir Putin and died in prison. It provides for the sanction of all officials complicit in such human rights crimes, and it allows members of Congress to initiate cases by asking the administration to investigate. investigate. Mr. Kassem’s case cries out for such action. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Cahf.) should try again. At a minimum, it would force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky), and his fellow Republicans, to go on the record again, because under the law the upper chamber is required to vote on this particular resolution. Mr. McConnell and most of his caucus in the end acted consistent with fealty to Mr. Trump, not the constitutional prerogatives of the independent legislative branch. They, and House Republicans, should be given a chance to mend their ways — or to persist in them, with full accountability before the public. FREDERICK J.

Mr. Abbott’s stance puts him on a par with Mr. Trump. The president slashed the cap on refugee admissions this year to 18,000 — the lowest level since the modern program was created 40 years ago, and down from the 110,000 President Barack Obama set before leaving office. Mr. Trump then let it be known that henceforth states and localities would be required to affirm their willingness to accept new arrivals. Mr. Abbott said he “appreciates” that other states are willing to take up the slack. True, more than 40 other governors, in addition to scores of localities, have said they are prepared to welcome refugees who, cleared and vetted by US. security agencies, are assisted in finding new homes by federally funded humanitarian groups. They, not the Texas governor, are acting in the spirit of true American values. Ln '-T LETTERS TO THE EDITOR letters@washpost.com Ripples from Soleimani’s death As a Canadian citizen, I am sure there are at least 57 families in Canada, and 113 others around the world, who do not share the views in Marc A. Thiessen’s Jan. 10 Friday Opinion essay, “Trump wins standoff with Iran.” Rollin Stanley, Silver Spring The Jan. 10 front-page article “Tensions flare as Congress chafes at its back seat role” detailed objections expressed by various members of Congress Congress to insufficient information from “the national security team” regarding the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani. Why were our representatives in the House and the Senate so exercised about being dismissed by the Trump administration after they have spent decades meekly handing to the executive branch authorities that our Constitution clearly defined as the sole domain of the legislators in Congress? The cowardice of some members of Congress who rushed out to avow their support for a “unitary executive” was nauseating, while those who knew better, such as Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.), a former military intelligence officer, offered only grumbles about how “it would’ve been a lot more helpful had I gotten a little peek into some of the intel that informed the operational decisions.” We were brought to this moment of utter dysfunction by a long string of presidents who lied and otherwise shaded the truth to test the limits of congressional power. Now, the flouting of congressional congressional authority to declare war and to approve the spending of taxpayer dollars on military adventures has become the norm. Will we see anytime soon a bipartisan surge of indignation and resolve to restore the proper balance envisioned by the Founders? I, for one, will not hold my breath. Beverly Fairchild, Knoxville Let physicians heal health care Regarding the Jan. 8 article “Health-care costs are like an $8,000 ‘tax’ on every family, economists say”: Economists attacking physician salaries when the United States spends $800 billion per year on superfluous administrative paperwork is misguided. misguided. Americans spent only $694.3 billion for physicians physicians and clinical services during the same year. Only in the United States would administrative costs exceed the amount spent on highly trained professionals professionals responsible for people’s lives. Was any consideration given to the high debt burden facing most young physicians, their exceptionally exceptionally long training requirements, the onerous litigation environment in the United States or even the hours physicians work? Physician salaries are neither the fastest growing nor the largest expenditures expenditures in our health-care budget by a long shot. Instead, let’s examine the concentration of hospital hospital monopolies, which studies show increase costs between 7 percent and 17 percent. Unless addressed, the $1.15 trillion spent on hospital care will grow unchecked. Congress just provided health insurers tax relief worth an estimated $352 billion over 10 years by repealing the health insurance tax and “Cadillac tax.” It might make for a good headline to attack physicians, but the truth is that physicians, not economists, are best suited to lead health-care reform. Gary Price, Washington The writer is president of the Physicians Foundation. Accidentally praising the government I almost missed the subtle irony of George F. Will’s Jan. 9 op-ed, “Beware the ‘market skeptic Republicans.’ Republicans.’ ” Mr. Will took exception to the notion that we live in a “new age of inequality.” He wrote that the Economist “reports, after adjusting for taxes and government transfer payments, since 2000 the share of national income of the top 1 percent ... has changed little since 1960.” In fact, the article describes describes the “explosion of research” on inequality that has produced differing results. Mr. Will cited a working paper that takes exception exception to what has become the prevalent view that the top 1 percent have claimed an increasing share of national income. The paper by Gerald Auten and David Splinter, economists at the Treasury Department Department and Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, respectively, adjusts for taxes and transfers, including including Social Security, the earned-income tax credit, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. As the Economist Economist points out, without these adjustments, Mr. Auten Auten and Mr. Splinter find that the top 1 percent’s share of pretax income has risen since the 1960s. The irony is that Mr. Will, who, as usual, argued against “progressives” who desire to allocate government government resources for the public good, seemed to belittle the notion of higher income inequality by citing a study that, in fact, suggests that it is government intervention that has kept higher inequality inequality in check. As I said, I almost missed it! James Wallar, Fairfax Mr. Sanders’s worldview Regarding the Jan. 12 front-page article “How would Sanders alter foreign policy as president?”: It is less important how Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, president, would “alter foreign policy as president” than how his call for a “political revolution” would rip apart the fabric of American society. Can we please be honest about the politics of Mr. Sanders? He is a democratic socialist. For those of you whose (wholesome) interest in governance is solely in ridding us of President Trump and Trumpism, Trumpism, please read World Population Review’s “Democratic “Democratic Socialist Countries 2020” report. Democratic socialism (vs. social democracy) advocates a “collectively” “collectively” owned or controlled economy with a “democratic” “democratic” political system. Both concepts are antithetical to our system of government, i.e., to individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Our rights are those of an individual, not a cookie-cutter person. What rights we have surrendered to government have been divided between two governments, each with limited powers and both charged with protecting our rights. The Constitution ensures that neither the federal nor state governments are a monarchy or a democracy, both threats to individual rights. Mr. Sanders knows exactly what his “worldview” would mean for us. He hides it behind offering cost-free remedies and pacifism pacifism except when he says we need a “political revolution.” revolution.” Only then is he being honest.

They sent the cameras back to us, and we took them to one of the remaining film shops in Washington, a block from our office, to get them developed. 1 These women are mothers, Hollywood actresses, retirees. They are cookbook authors and NASCAR drivers and college students. They span four generations, live in the Midwest and California and the Northeast and the South. 1 In the age of Instagram and the Internet, it’s too easy to snap, edit and curate our lives. Instead, these women captured their lives on film, with no real idea of which photos would turn out, no ability to edit away the imperfections. Then, they waited.

Despite the criticism from Murkowski and others, there was little sign Thursday of a wholesale defection by Republicans from Trump, as many GOP leaders remained remained silent on the president’s recent words and actions. Still, the pushback was striking after 314 years during which Trump’s words and actions have prompted little more than occasional expressions of dismay from his allies. “When I saw General Mattis’s comments yesterday, I felt like perhaps we’re getting to the point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally, and have the courage of our own convictions to speak up,” Murkowski said. Asked if she could still support Trump, the Alaska senator said, “I am struggling with it. I have struggled struggled with it for a long time.” She added, “He is duly elected our president. I will continue to work with him. I will continue to work with this administration.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who has been more willing than most in his party to speak out against Ihimp, called Mattis’s statement “stunning and powerful.” “He’s an American patriot,” Romney said. “He’s an individual whose judgment I respect, and I think the world of him. If I ever had to choose somebody to be in a foxhole with, it would be with a General Mattis.” The comments came as Trump responded to Mattis’s criticism by disparaging him in a tweet. “His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public public relations,” the president wrote. “I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom ‘brought home the bacon’. I didn’t like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!” Trump suggested he had fired Mattis, but the former general tendered tendered his resignation as secretary of defense in 2018 as he disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull U.S. forces out of Syria, numerous U.S. officials have said. Trump also responded to Murkowski by vowing to travel to Colorado’s youngest black elected official becomes face of Denver protests by Jennifer Oldham DENVER — Tay Anderson stood on North Broadway in the heart of downtown Denver, hundreds of protesters milling around him. SWAT officers pulled up, got out of their cars, gripping paintball paintball and tear-gas guns, and tried to herd the crowd back onto the sidewalk. The protest that Friday had been noisy but peaceful. Now, as rush-hour traffic eased its way past the mass, the situation grew tense and uncertain. Officers shoved Anderson as he tried to ask the commander for permission permission to remain on the thoroughfare. thoroughfare. So Anderson texted the police chief. “I gave him a directive,” said Anderson. “I said we are going to go onto the streets, and either you block them off, or we block them off. And he worked with us.” At 21, the Denver school board member is the youngest African American ever elected to public office in Colorado. He has also become the de facto leader of protests in Denver following the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. For a week, protesters have marched peacefully and periodically faced off with law enforcement clad in bulky body armor. Some demonstrators demonstrators defaced landmarks, looted looted businesses and threw stones at police, who responded with sponge bullets, pepper balls and stun grenades. After officers fired chemical agents into a crowd that included included Denver Public Schools students students on May 28, Anderson stepped into the leadership vacuum. vacuum. The stocky Manual High School graduate quickly became the public face of what some in the Mile High City term a second civil rights movement. Even as he called out white allies for disrupting rallies, Anderson himself was tear-gassed twice and shot with rubber bullets. His style has drawn praise and criticism. Some marchers disagreed disagreed with Anderson’s coordination coordination with police. He said he Alaska in 2022, when she is up for reelection, to campaign against her. “Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don’t care, I’m endorsing,” endorsing,” he tweeted. “If you have a pulse, I’m with you!” The reaction of former military leaders as Trump has spoken of deploying the military to quell looting and other aggressive behavior behavior by protesters has been striking. Kelly and Mattis are both retired four-star Marine generals. So is John Allen, who criticized Trump on Wednesday in a piece in Foreign Policy magazine for his threats to use the military on protesters protesters and his controversial church photo op on Monday. Allen wrote that Trump’s actions “may well signal the beginning of the end of the American experiment.” Still, many Republicans stuck by Trump or were silent. On Fox News on Thursday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggested Mattis Mattis had bought into a false narrative narrative promoted by the media. “It is so fashionable to blame President Trump for every wrong in America, and he can be a handful handful — and can he do better? Yes — but the problems we have in America today were not caused by President Trump,” Graham said, adding: “This is just such easy, cheap politics.” The fireworks played out while Floyd was eulogized as a loving man whose death symbolized an American sickness. Thursday’s memorial services were the start of a four-day period of mourning for Floyd, which will conclude next week with a burial in Floyd’s hometown of Houston. On Wednesday in Minneapolis, the city where Floyd died, the crowd included senators, mayors, the governor governor and Hollywood actors. In New York, thousands gathered. In Washington, Democratic senators held a public remembrance. It was a sign of the remarkable effect Floyd’s death has produced: A national groundswell of protests over police brutality, a largely leaderless movement that has defied defied tear gas, a pandemic, and looters to persist in calls for change. But the memorials also focused on the horrific way that life ended. In Minneapolis, with Floyd’s casket casket at the front of the church, the crowd stayed silent for eight minutes minutes and 46 seconds — the amount of time that officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck. As the silence lasted and lasted, people in the crowd began to sob. DAVID ZALUBOWSKI/ASSOCIATED PRESS Tay Anderson, center, a member of the Denver school board, dispatches protesters.

He confronted white protesters as they spraypainted spraypainted “All cops are bastards” on a wall, and he urged everyone to get tested for the coronavirus. Gov.

After pandemic-related closures closures left him cooped up for weeks in a stuffy basement apartment apartment near Cheesman Park, where he attended school board meetings on Zoom, the plainspoken plainspoken Anderson suddenly found himself representing millions millions of Coloradans on CNN and television stations in Australia and Canada.

There have been public disagreements disagreements with conservative state HOLLY PICKETT FOR THE WASHINGTON POST Protesters cross the Brooklyn Bridge on Thursday during a memorial for George Floyd. The services began a four-day mourning period that will end with Floyd’s burial in Houston next week. From the back, a man cried out, his voice muffled by a face mask, repeating repeating some of Floyd’s final words: “I can’t breathe!” That caused many to cry even harder and another voice to call out, “I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!” When the silence ended, the Rev. A1 Sharpton said, “They had enough time,” referring to the police police officers involved. ‘Now what are we going to do with our time?” The orations were broadcast into the surrounding neighborhood, neighborhood, and among those listening outside was Albert Ettinga, an immigrant immigrant from Cameroon who brought his family in from a Minneapolis Minneapolis suburb. They wore Tshirts Tshirts that said “I cant breathe,” across the front. “I believe that history has begun begun in Minneapolis — the world is listening,” he said. “I have kids that were born in this country, I have to really start fighting for them, and hopefully they can rewrite history themselves.” Sharpton and the Floyd family also announced a mass march on Washington this August to urge Congress Congress to pass a policing equality act. Georgia, meanwhile, provided a reminder that the protesters’ anger is focused not only on what happened to Floyd, but to any number of African Americans who have suffered at the hands of police — or others. legislators, who criticized his bold exhortations on social media in the wake of Floyd’s death. The backlash strengthened strengthened his resolve to address injustices injustices against people of color, including Denver Public Schools students. “It’s been a whirlwind,” said the once-homeless Anderson, as he typed on a tablet the outline of a measure that would end the district’s agreement with the Denver Police Department to provide school resource officers, or SROs, on about 18 campuses. Anderson won his second school board race in November for an at-large position with 67,213 votes — in part on a promise to replace SROs with nurses and counselors who would prioritize restorative practices. “It’s about eliminating the school-to-prison pipeline,” he said. “Too often, students of color are targeted in schools and given tickets and citations.” He added that he and fellow school board members would ask the community community on Friday to help draft the A judge in that state ruled Thursday that three men would stand trial for murder in the killing killing of Arbery, an unarmed black man who was shot in February while he was jogging. A detective said in court that the three men had pursued Arbery in their vehicles, then cornered him. After a struggle, Arbery was shot dead. The men never called 911 during during the pursuit, the detective said. He added that one of them — 34 year-old Travis McMichael — uttered uttered the words “f—ing n—” as Arbery lay dying in the road. Although Thursday’s protests were largely peaceful nationwide, there was at least one ugly incident. incident. In Buffalo, video from news station WBFO showed police in riot gear clearing a largely empty plaza. An elderly man approached and officers shoved him backward — causing the man to stumble, fall and hit his head on the concrete. Officers walked past as the man lay bleeding from his head. Two officers involved in the incident have been suspended without pay, Capt. Jeff Rinaldo with the Buffalo Police Department said Thursday night. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz later tweeted that the man was in stable condition at a local hospital. Still, around the country on Thursday, many of the memorials and demonstrations were peacemeasure peacemeasure to end the SRO agreement. agreement. Denver police would still patrol school parking lots, and unarmed security personnel would remain in buildings under his proposal, he said. Anderson, who honed his leadership skills as Manual High School student body president during his junior and senior years, said he wants to help kids cultivate a sense of trust in law enforcement that is lacking today. today. Anderson moved with his mother to Denver from Kansas City in 2012, on the night President President Barack Obama won reelection. reelection. He entered the foster-care system his sophomore year. After moving home, Anderson and his mother had a falling-out, and he became briefly homeless his senior senior year before a family in east Denver invited him to stay with them.

Today, he seeks advice from his mom. ful, even hopeful. In Washington, the sweltering day’s crowds were smaller than they have been recently. Rain was in the forecast, and a bigger march was planned for Saturday. But despite despite the lighter crowds, crews were installing taller fences around the White House, with new concrete barriers behind them. At the U.S. Capitol, Senate Democrats Democrats gathered for a moment of silence that also lasted eight minutes minutes and 46 seconds — their first in-person gathering since the covid-19 pandemic began. The senators used a cavernous hall in the now-empty Capitol Visitor Visitor Center, standing several feet apart. A handful of Democrats knelt on one or both knees, a symbolic symbolic action that started with former former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick Kaepernick protesting against police brutality, but has taken on double significance after Floyd died as a result of a white officer kneeling on his neck. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” Senate Chaplain Barry Black said in an opening prayer.

Instead of mostly white people, the marches now include many young black faces, said Timothy lyier, pastor of the Shorter Community Community African Methodist Episcopal Episcopal Church. The social justice leader met Anderson several years ago at Manual and attended rallies with him, sometimes having “to snatch the bullhorn away from him.” He keeps a close eye on the young activist, whom he considers considers “like a son.” “I busted Tay one day,” lyier recalled. “I said, ‘Tay, put on your mask.’ We are fighting two pandemics, pandemics, racism and covid-19, and I’m not sure which one of them is worn. He said it was an attempt to reclaim the narrative of orderly, peaceful protests following nights of unrest. “In our culture, when we send somebody home, we do it right,” said Stephen Lockett, 30, a resident resident of Crown Heights. “You put your suit on, you wear a tie and you send that person off. We wanted to respectfully send George Floyd off today.” Maintenance workers, healthcare healthcare workers and other Manhattanites Manhattanites waiting in line at a food pantry just off the park at 109th Street applauded the protesters. At one point, two protesters reenacted reenacted the killing of Floyd. One played the part of Floyd, lying face down on the Fifth Avenue asphalt, and the other acted as Chauvin, who dug his knee into the back of Floyd’s neck as Floyd declared, “I can’t breathe.” Residents of the apartments opened their window to clap, bang pots and create a clamor of support for the masses. In Brooklyn, a memorial service for Floyd turned hostile when New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) took the stage and many in the crowd booed the mayor over the city’s use of curfews and aggressive aggressive actions by city police. “De Blasio, go home,” they chanted, followed by “[expletive] your curfew.” In the days since Floyd’s death, New York has been the scene of large peaceful protests — but also widespread looting and accusations accusations of police brutality. De Blasio has been criticized by Trump for not using enough force, and by many residents for allowing police to use too much. In his speech, de Blasio said that New York needed to more fully recognize the damage of racism, but he defended police as “doing something very difficult at this moment, and showing a lot of restraint and trying to shepherd us through this moment to a better better and more peaceful moment.” He was loudly booed, and only spoke for about two minutes. Several state and city officials used their time atop the podium to criticize de Blasio. “This is supposed to be the progressive progressive beacon of this country, and we are failing,” said New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams Williams (D). ‘We have the wrong president, president, we have the wrong governor, and we have the wrong mayor.” david.fahrenthold@washpost.com paul.kane@washpost.com josh.dawsey@wcLshpost.com the most dangerous.” Not one to shy away from controversy, Anderson, who failed his first year of high school, sided with Denver teachers teachers in a 2019 strike and earned the endorsement of the union and some of Colorado’s bestknown bestknown elected officials. “He was very aggressive in fighting on behalf of the students,” students,” said former Denver mayor mayor Wellington Webb (D), the first African American to hold the position. “He tended to reach out to everyone, whether they were friend or foe, and to develop his own constituency.” Anderson built coalitions to protest the Dakota Access pipeline pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota and to march in support of gun control and Black Lives Matter. This time around, he faces increasing increasing scrutiny from elected officials across the political spectrum. spectrum. State Rep. Patrick Neville (R) reacted to a tweet that Anderson posted in advance of the Denver protests that read: “Sometimes you must burn it down in order to rebuild.” In response, Neville wrote: “This doesn’t sound ‘peaceful.’ Why would he put this out hours before the riots started?” started?” Anderson responded: “Coming “Coming from a guy that poses with White Supremacists ... HAVE A SEAT, Pat.” Dressed in a white T-shirt and black shorts, the barefoot school board member recently handed quarters for laundry to his high school friend and roommate roommate as he explained how the controversial remark lines up with his calls for protesters to refrain from violence. He said he can relate to the pain and anger of black activists in Minnesota who burned down a police station, but added that “war doesn’t always mean tanks and murder.” “I think we finally have the attention of America,” Anderson said. “We are not asking for special treatment; we are asking just to be treated as humans.” national@washpost.com",6/5/2020,"('policy', 'amid', 'rapid')","('the', 'region', 's')","[' Anderson is among a cadre of young elected officials of color in Colorado pushing for systemic change in education, criminal justice and police policy amid rapid gentrification of the region’s region’s historic black and brown communities.']", Anderson is among a cadre of young elected officials of color in Colorado pushing for systemic change in education criminal justice and police policy amid rapid gentrification of the regions regions historic black and brown communities
1142,2439037632,"()c i)asl|iiuiton post AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER EDITORIALS Mr. Trump and China’s camps Congress shows that America does not share the president’s contempt for human dignity and rights. S TARTING IN 2017, a picture slowly began to emerge from China’s far northwest: compounds compounds surrounded by watchtowers, no trees, high fences, and reports of people being taken away without due process or explanation. Eyewitnesses Eyewitnesses and family members described how China was building a string of concentration camps for its Uighur minority and others, incarcerating more than 1 million Turkic Muslims in an attempt to eradicate their culture, language and identity, one of the most appalling human rights abuses in the world today. China’s leaders first denied the camps existed, then later claimed they were schools for vocational education. But the evidence piled up that they were camps intended to wipe out the Uighur Muslim identity through mind-numbing lessons in Mandarin Mandarin and demands that the prisoners renounce their religion, conform to the ways of the majority Han Chinese and respect the ruling Communist Party. On June 29 last year, President Trump met in Osaka, Japan, with President Xi Jinping of China. Virus fight lags on contact tracing Locating asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases makes tracking more difficult. A FTER THE initial wave of novel coronavirus coronavirus infections, the next period — waiting for an effective vaccine or drug therapy — will be a slog, and require a host of measures to suppress outbreaks and keep people safe. One essential ingredient for this next period is nowhere near ready. If the economy is to be reopened in a way that is smart and prevents a major virus resurgence, the states must accelerate plans for contact tracing. Contact tracing locates those who are sick, using case-by-case detective work, discovering whom they may have exposed, and isolating the ill so others can return to schools, offices and factories. It has worked elsewhere, such as in South Korea. President Trump has negligently dumped much of the burden for the coronavirus response onto the states. An overarching federal response to the pandemic would have been better, but at this point, the states have the ball. Contact tracing has long been in the toolbox of state public health departments. departments. Impressive efforts are underway to stand up contact tracing teams, but as Frances Stead Sellers and Ben Guarino report in The Post, the nation is fragmented and the results a patchwork. Overall, the United States is moving too slowly. A National Public Radio survey shows that the workforce in contact tracing nationwide has tripled in the past six weeks, from 11,142 workers to 37,110, but still well short of the estimated 100,000 or more tracers that some experts say is the minimum needed nationwide. According to NPR, given current case counts, only seven states and the District of Columbia are prepared to contain outbreaks. Tracing and containment become harder when infections spike, as has occurred in Arizona. According to the multidisciplinary team at Covid Act Now, Arizona has only 100 contact tracers, but with an average of 1,740 new daily cases, needs 8,700 staff to trace all new cases in 48 hours, before too many other people are infected. By contrast, New York has 9,600 contact tracers; with an A principled resignation Ms. Taylor’s departure from the administration leaves her with some honor. C ORE VALUES. Convictions. Dictates of conscience. conscience. Those are concepts not generally associated with those who have chosen to serve in the principle-free administration of President Trump. So it was striking — indeed, refreshing — to see a senior official in the State Department invoke and, more importantly, act on those tenets in protest of the president’s incendiary handling of racial tensions heightened by the killing of George Floyd. Mary Elizabeth Taylor, assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs and one of the administration’s highest-ranking African Americans, submitted her resignation Thursday with a rebuke of Mr. Trump’s response to nationwide protests against racial inequality and police brutality. That response has LOCAL OPINIONS Black D.C. matters Regarding the June 17 Metro article “D.C. statehood statehood bill is scheduled for a House vote next week”: House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer Hoyer (D-Md.) announced that a D.C. statehood vote will take place on the House floor on June 26 and that this vote shows “respect” for a city with a large African American population. In 1970, our city was more than 70 percent African American, but what became of Chocolate City? In 2015, the city dropped to below 50 percent African American. It is conservatively estimated that more than 40,000 black families have been pushed out of the District in the past decade alone due to harmful policies that fuel the gentrification of D.C. neighborhoods. These policies, propelled by D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council, Council, hide behind skewed definitions of “affordability” and use a regional, rather than a local, area median According to former national security adviser John Bolton, in a new memoir, Mr. Ihimp used the meeting to beg Mr. Xi to buy American farm products to help with his reelection. Mr. Xi also defended China’s camps in Xinjiang. “According to our interpreter,” Bolton writes, “Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do.” Mr. Trump has called Bolton’s book a “compilation of lies and made up stories.” In the meeting with Mr. Trump, the Chinese president probably did not call them concentration camps, and we do not know exactly how Mr. Trump replied. Presumably, there are interpreters’ notes in both countries. But if Mr. Trump provided so much as a wink or green light to Mr. Xi’s grotesque project in cultural annihilation, it marks another moral low in his presidency. We already knew that Mr. Trump cared not a fig for human rights in China. He reportedly told Mr. Xi last year that he would soften the US. response to a crackdown in Hong Kong in order to get a trade TOM TOLES average of 695 new daily cases, the state is in a position to trace all new infections in 48 hours. When combined with widely available testing, it means the virus there may be contained without lockdowns. The high proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases in the pandemic makes contact tracing more difficult. So does the natural suspicion of people who are contacted. Just getting a proper caller ID could help contact tracers reach people who are overwhelmed with spam phone calls. Then tracers must coax people to cooperate, included threats to shoot looters, violently forcing peaceful demonstrators from Lafayette Square and fighting efforts to change the names of Army bases that honor Confederate generals. “Moments of upheaval can change you, shift the trajectory of your life, and mold your character,” she wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “The president’s comments and actions surrounding surrounding racial injustice and Black Americans cut sharply against my core values and convictions. I must follow the dictates of my conscience and resign as Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs.” Critics and cynics — and there are no shortage of both in Washington — question why it took Ms. Taylor S 1 ^ years to realize the president she was serving is utterly devoid of character and uses race income (which includes some of the country’s richest counties). Ms. Bowser wrote in her June 15 op-ed, ‘The protests show why D.C. statehood matters,” that to think the District’s lack of voting representation and its large black population are not related is to be “willfully ignorant of our nation’s history.” Is it just a coincidence that the long struggle by black Washingtonians Washingtonians for statehood has been delayed and denied until now, when the black population is no longer the majority in the city? Is it the same coincidence that the grocery stores and playgrounds lobbied for in neighborhoods with lower-income black families have been delayed or denied until they are displaced, displaced, or until newer whiter residents arrive? To ignore these truths would be to be willfully ignorant of our city’s history and our current reality. Nawal Rajeh, Washington agreement, his singular pursuit. But this willful disregard of repression has consequences. Mr. Trump’s message in Osaka was that he would not use the power of the presidency nor the influence of the United States to save the Uighurs from cultural extinction. He may have emboldened Mr. Xi to tighten the screws on Hong Kong this year. Mr. Trump sullies the values of human dignity and freedom that the United States has championed around the world for generations. Within hours of leaks about Mr. Bolton’s book, Mr. Trump signed the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, which includes possible sanctions against those involved in repression of the Uighur people. The law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, a welcome sign that Mr. Trump’s contempt for human dignity is not the stance of the US. government government nor of America itself. Mr. Trump was right to put his signature to it, whatever his motivation now. Standing up against coerced brainwashing, forced incarceration and destruction of a people’s heritage is “exactly the right thing to do.” overcoming a reluctance to inform on others, especially friends and family, who might then have to self-quarantine as a result. While part of the federal money set aside for testing in the federal stimulus packages can go to contact tracing, states confront their own budget woes. State public health officials estimated in late April they needed about $4.8 billion to prepare 100,000 workers for contact tracing. Reopening is popular, but doing it without sufficient contact tracing and testing is foolish. We can and must be smarter. as a tool to inflame the culture war that serves his political interests. Shouldn’t his birther campaign against the country’s first black president have been a clue to what she was signing on to when she joined the administration at its start? Surely his comments in the aftermath of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 — “very fine people on both sides” — should have removed any lingering doubts. No doubt Ms. Taylor may be a little late. That, though, doesn’t diminish the significance of her departure or the principle and guts she demonstrated demonstrated in calling out the president’s actions as unacceptable. unacceptable. She leaves with some honor, something that not a lot of people who worked for Mr. Trump or continue to work for him can claim. Slje lUasl)imiton jJod FREDERICK J.

Will’s June 17 op-ed, “A master class in legal textualism”: Justice Neil M. Gorsuch correctly expounded the text of the 56-year-old federal ban on employment discrimination “because of ... sex” to hold that firings based on homosexuality or transgender status were prohibited. In both cases, employees with the same sexual attractions or identity are treated differently because of their sex, e.g., a male employee is discharged because sexually attracted to males but an identically situated female employee is not.

Bruce Fein, Washington The writer was an associate deputy attorney general from 1981 to 1983. Regarding the June 16 front-page article “High court affirms LGBTQ worker protections”: Lady Bird Johnson liked to say, “Words have wings,” meaning be careful because, once you say something, the words are out there and you can’t bring them back, you can’t control them. Same goes for written words. Case in point: The Supreme Court decision that it is illegal to discriminate against gays and other sexual minorities in hiring. The court decision is based on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Why does that act have the word “sex”? Why does it outlaw discrimination discrimination based on “sex”? It happened because a troglodyte troglodyte member of Congress, Rep. Howard W. Smith (D-Va.), wanted to kill that bill. He was against civil rights, so he thought to introduce an amendment that said discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal, thinking it would kill the legislation. But the majority of Congress thought about it and decided, “This seems like a really good idea! ” The amendment and, ultimately, the law passed. Smith has long since died, but if he knew what has become of his word “sex” in the Civil Rights Act, he probably would turn over in his grave. Be careful what you say and write. For better or worse, words have wings. David M. Barrett, Havertown, Pa. Regarding the June 17 news article “Surprise author of a surprising decision”: Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.’s dissent dissent in the Bostock case included an interesting line of reasoning: “If every single living American had been surveyed in 1964, it would have been hard to find any who thought that discrimination because of sex meant discrimination because of sexual orientation orientation — not to mention gender identity, a concept concept that was essentially unknown at the time.” I wonder whether Justice Alito could explain why the same reasoning doesn’t apply to other decisions of the court. If every single living American had been surveyed in 1964 or in 1791, it would have been hard to find any who thought that the right to bear arms included the right of private individuals to carry assault weapons, a concept that was essentially unknown at those times. Jack Hirsch, Silver Spring A big pile of business as usual According to Virginia state Sens. Dick Saslaw and Mamie E.

Training and sentencing reform have already been tried and have failed. Racial disparities come from layers of individual decisions (policing, prosecuting, sentencing) made by people born and raised in our pervasively racist society. If we have the political will, then we are capable of measuring and correcting racially disparate policing. policing. If blacks get jail time instead of community service more often than whites, then release nonviolent nonviolent offenders from jail to remove the disparity. If blacks disproportionately receive traffic fines and fees, then issue refunds until the disparity is removed. removed. Until we are willing to measure and correct racial disparities in policing, racial disparities will persist.

End qualified immunity In his June 17 op-ed, “The Supreme Court should fix this mistake,” James A. Wynn Jr., a judge on the US. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, asked the Supreme Court to repeal the doctrine of qualified immunity. I strongly support his position. Others also support repealing qualified immunity, which is another term for sovereign immunity. I am a retired lawyer and a former trial attorney in the Civil Division of the Justice Department. After entering private practice in Virginia, I was required to take mandatory continuing legal education classes. classes. Some years back I attended a program at Cambridge University in England sponsored by the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association. In one of our classes, the subject of sovereign immunity was mentioned by one of the attendees. The professor suddenly stopped her presentation and asked if we had sovereign immunity in the United States. When the answer was affirmative, she said, “Isn’t that quaint. You have sovereign immunity but no sovereign. sovereign. We have a sovereign but no sovereign immunity.” immunity.” The concept of sovereign immunity or qualified immunity, whatever you want to call it, has no place in our modern jurisprudence and should be repealed. repealed.

777,2439018267,"CRITIC’S NOTEBOOK Social distancing may give New Yorkers the tourist-free High Line they’ve always wanted ARCHITECTURE Once packed park can t open without limiting guests, and space will be a beautiful thing R by Adrian Higgins obert Hammond has known two periods of stillness on the High Line. The first was in the late 1990s, when he and fellow civic activist Joshua David walked the abandoned, abandoned, elevated freight railroad on New York’s West Side and knew it could be revived as a beguiling public park. Trudging past the corroded rails and jungle of self-seeded plants, Hammond did not see this industrial relic as anything but magical. No decay could overcome the feeling that the rusting hulk, perched 30 feet in the air, offered a strange and alluring platform from which to view the Manhattan skyline on one side and the Hudson River on the other. “It looked hard and soft, beautiful and ugly,” he said. “It was so different from the rest of the city.” The second pause, caused by the coronavirus coronavirus pandemic, reflects an entirely different different emptiness and in some respects a more dystopian one because of the way the High Line became so popular since it opened in 2009. This silence is far more jolting. Restored, redesigned and repurposed as a pedestrian greenway on stilts, the 1.5mile 1.5mile linear park now draws some 8 million visitors annually, so many that there are times when the entrances must be closed to prevent overcrowding. Perhaps unfairly, it has also been seen as a catalyst for the hyper-gentrification of the Meatpacking District and West Chelsea Chelsea neighborhoods through which it threads. What was once a down-to-earth blue-collar area has morphed into a playground playground for the rich, with an eruption of high-rise offices, shops and condos catering catering to the wealthy. These glitzy buildings have closed in around the High Line over the past 11 years. The starkest transformation transformation is the creation of Hudson Yards, the $25 billion mini-city that has sprung up at the northern stretch. How these condos and offices fare through the pandemic and beyond is open to speculation. The more pressing issue is, how can the High Line reopen safely when much of its path is just eight feet wide? The space is operated by the Friends of the High Line, co-founded by David and Hammond, who is the executive director. While most New York parks, including Central Park, have remained open, the High Line’s entrance gates have been closed because of the obvious difficulty in keeping people apart. One approach, adopted by public gardens gardens around the country, is to issue timed tickets so that a much reduced visitor flow is metered. Hammond, however, wouldn’t be drawn into specifics. “We are still working with the city to determine how many visitors we can sustain while maintaining maintaining good distances,” he said by phone. “We are considering a lot of options.” (The Department of Parks and Recreation Recreation referred operational questions to the Friends group.) The silver lining, for New Yorkers at least, is that when it does reopen, the High Line will be far more welcoming simply because it may take years for New York to return to the level of tourism — some 65 million visitors a year — it attained before the coronavirus crisis. In the interval between limited reopening reopening and a world back to normal, whenever that may be, the High Line will become something closer to its original idea, a quirky postindustrial gift to the West Side. It may become for New Yorkers what the cultural treasures of Florence and Venice are now for their citizens: havens devoid of the hordes of out-of-towners. “If we are having to limit the number of people for safety, it’s going to give people a different experience, and it’s going to be mostly New Yorkers,” Hammond said. If this prospect has New Yorkers salivating salivating about a tourist-free High Line, Hammond Hammond said, he hasn’t felt the pressure to fling open the gates. “We want to open, but when it is safe,” he said. “We don’t want to open and then have to close it back down because it’s not safe.” A survey of High Line users last year indicated that more than half were international international visitors and that just 1 in 5 lived in the city. Justin Davidson, writing last year in the Intelligencer, described it as “a cattle chute for tourists.” For lifelong New Yorkers such as Wendy Goodman, the High Line has been a place to avoid, except in foul weather. “I love the High Line, I’ll walk it only in the worst weather, when it’s freezing or raining, because it’s the only time you can walk it without blocks of people,” she said. Goodman Goodman is the design editor of New York Magazine and lives in nearby Greenwich Village. The High Line opened in three sections over its first five years, the last part running alongside Hudson Yards before finally curving around close to the Hudson River. A short fourth section, the Spur, opened last year. High Line users find areas of repose — a lawn, for example, and a performance stage overlooking Tenth Avenue — but most of it features a decked promenade alongside mass plantings of perennials PHOTOS BY HATNIM LEE FOR THE WASHINGTON I D OST and grasses devised by the Dutch landscape landscape designer Piet Oudolf and redolent of the wildflowers that seeded in after the High Line’s disuse in 1980. Throughout, railroad tracks function as design elements. elements. Sculpture and other artworks are exhibited on a rotating basis. Live performances performances are staged regularly. Less obvious is the engineering and construction that went into rebuilding the High Line, including the extensive drainage drainage systems that underlie what is essentially essentially a rooftop garden. The project architects architects were Diller Scofidio + Renfro and the landscape architects James Corner Field Operations. Hammond said the initial, raw sense of the abandoned High Line as an unlikely platform to view Manhattan has evolved into an experience that relies on all its component parts. “One of the things that makes it special is not just the plants, the architecture, the city, but the people,” he said. “You need all four.” For many, the aura of luxury living embodied by Hudson Yards has become emblematic of New York as a city no longer belonging to common folk, except as an audience to wealth. Look online, and you will find a onebedroom onebedroom apartment renting for more than $5,000 a month and a two-bedroom condo going for $3.7 million. The conglomeration also houses a 720,000-square-foot shopping shopping mall, an art venue named the Shed and a $200 million monumental sculpture named the Vessel by Thomas Heatherwick, essentially a basket of interconnected stairs. Built over 28 acres of rail yards, Hudson Yards didn’t displace anyone, directly at least, but critics have assailed its bombast and disconnection from the reality of city life. Alexandra Schwartz, writing in the New Yorker, said Hudson Yards feels like “a nice airport terminal, with the High Line as its moving walkway.” Goodman calls it “an aberration of horror.” “The wonderful thing about New York City is that all these neighborhoods had a purpose,” she said. “The warehouse buildings buildings were warehouses, the schools were schools, and now it’s all condos. God forbid we should have an authentic neighborhood.” neighborhood.” Hammond says the High Line may have been given too much credit — or blame — for the development around it, but he acknowledges that a greater effort could have been made to preserve space for more affordable housing. In hindsight, “it’s easy to say,” he says. In 1999, “the project was thought to be crazy, and most people thought it wasn’t going to work.” As a result, the Friends organization has established the High Line Network to advise reuse projects in other cities about ways to mitigate gentrifying effects, including including the 11th Street Bridge Park over the Anacostia River in the District. The negative effects of the High Line’s popularity shouldn’t distract from the park’s value as an exemplar of adaptive-reuse adaptive-reuse landscape architecture and horticultural horticultural design. By witnessing Oudolf’s artistry artistry and the work of the gardeners, millions of people have registered, if only subconsciously, subconsciously, a form of esoteric herbaceous gardening previously thought avant garde. As for the first empty spring since the High Line was reincarnated, “people just miss it,” Hammond said. “The number one question has not been, When are you going to open?’ it’s, ‘How are the plants doing?’ ” The High Line closed March 16, and its eight gardeners have been back only this month. In late winter, 200 volunteers descend on the beds to cut back the previous season’s top growth on the perennials perennials and grasses, left for effect. About two-thirds of that work was done before the closure, said horticulture director Eric Rodriguez, leaving the Chelsea Grasslands and the Wildflower Field shaggier as they rebounded through the spring. Given the inherently more stressful environment of a rooftop garden, Oudolf selected plants that were tough and could take neglect, and his planting design was always meant to ebb and flow as specific plants seeded and spread. Most of the selected shrubs and trees, for example, are suckering species that can regenerate from their roots. “Our plants typically fare better than most gardens designed for horticultural effect,” Rodriguez said. Even before the closing, the horticulturists horticulturists had taken a more hands-off approach. “A lot of plants have stabilized as a community, so without human intervention, intervention, it seems they have found their own sense of equilibrium,” Rodriguez said. He is taking advantage of the pause to do less cleanup and grooming to see how the plants behave uncosseted. The main wooded areas, the Gansevoort Woodland, the Chelsea Thicket and the Falcone Flyover have matured to a point where they are viewed less as individual specimens than as pockets of urban forest, he said. As the humans have departed, “the bird population in the woodlands has increased astronomically.” Rodriguez said he believes that when the High Line reopens, New Yorkers will appreciate it as never before. Green spaces will have “new meaning,” he said. The High Line, Hammond said, has been a comfort to the city during difficult times and will remain so. “It was born after 9/11, it opened during the Great Recession, so for a lot of people, it’s a symbol of hope and rebirth.” One thing is certain, he added. “It’s more beautiful with people on it.” adrian. higgins @ washpost. com @adrian_higgins on Twitter □ Also atwashingtonpost.com Read past columns by Higgins at washingtonpost.com/home.",6/28/2020,"('for', 'the', 'hyper')","('the', 'meatpacking', 'district')","[' Perhaps unfairly, it has also been seen as a catalyst for the hyper-gentrification of the Meatpacking District and West Chelsea Chelsea neighborhoods through which it threads.']", Perhaps unfairly it has also been seen as a catalyst for the hypergentrification of the Meatpacking District and West Chelsea Chelsea neighborhoods through which it threads
1209,2447052770,"City tries to bring sense of order to Black Lives Matter Plaza BLM PLAZA FROM A1 ential K Street lobbying firms, government offices and high-end restaurants that abruptly shut down when the novel coronavirus overtook the city. The christening of Black Lives Matter Plaza by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) turned the corridor on 16th Street between H and I streets into a new destination — a rollicking blend of open-air soapbox, soapbox, campground, flea market, museum and 24-hour hangout. Yet in recent days, even with most downtown offices still shuttered shuttered and the power-lunch crowd unlikely to return any time soon, D.C. officials have moved to restore restore a sense of order. Inspectors last week dispersed vendors who had settled on the plaza with threats of $2,000 fines. They told volunteers distributing free food and water to remove grills, tables, canopies and coolers. coolers. Police have ordered protesters protesters to take down tents, and the city erected fencing to block access access to Lafayette Square and St. John’s Episcopal Church, which was defaced and set on fire during the demonstrations. There are still occasional marches, including one that a coalition of African American fraternities fraternities and sororities staged over the weekend. A vigil was held Saturday for the late congressman congressman John Lewis (D-Ga.), a hero of the civil rights movement whose visit to the plaza shortly after its unveiling amounted to a kind of benediction. It turned out to be his last public appearance. On most days, though, Black Lives Matter Plaza draws trickles of visitors who wander the corridor corridor as if they were touring a museum. They stop to pose in front of the street art — a brightly painted mural of a black fist over here, another of Breonna Taylor over there — all suitable for Instagram. Instagram. “It feels like the gentrification of the whole movement,” activist Nahom Demoz, 33, said as the yoga class assembled on the portion portion of the plaza where the yellow letters spell out “M-A-T-T-E-R.” “I understand that it could be good intentions,” he said. “But the road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Demoz spent weeks volunteering volunteering at Earl’s First Amendment Grill, a self-styled food stand. He and other activists cooked burgers burgers and hot dogs free for anyone who asked — that is, until city inspectors showed up. “It’s fizzling out,” he said. ‘We need to strike a balance’ As the District has stepped up enforcement, the few activists still assembling at the plaza trade speculation about its future, whether the city will remove barriers barriers that seal off the two blocks from traffic and whether Bowser’s painted letters will remain. A spokesperson for the mayor, citing pending litigation, declined declined to respond to questions about the vendors or the plaza’s future. Many downtown businesses remain boarded up or closed even as others are making a go of reopening. Traffic is light even at rush hour. “Welcome Back,” reads the sign outside McCormick & Schmick’s, a steakhouse and seafood restaurant restaurant on K Street where a couple awaited their order at an outdoor table the other day. At Black Lives Matter Plaza, P. J. Clarke’s, a restaurant that advertises advertises itself as “a stone’s throw from the White House,” is still shuttered, a spray of profane graffiti graffiti disparaging President Trump on the wall to the right of the entrance. A few feet away, a man in a mask and goggles slumped on a metal folding chair, using an outdoor outlet to charge his cellphone. cellphone. “Why is that flag upside down?” Anne Rocca, 53, visiting from San Francisco, asked her husband, Joe, as they gazed at a turned-over American flag someone someone had attached to a lamppost at the corner. Neil O. Albert, executive director director of the Downtown DC Business Improvement District, said the pandemic had turned the city’s commercial core into a “ghost town.” The vendors on the plaza, he said, needed to be removed to maintain “pedestrian access to the buildings with as little obstruction obstruction as possible.” “We need to restore a sense of normalcy so businesses can reopen,” reopen,” he said during a visit to the plaza. As for whether the strip should remain closed to traffic, he said the District needs to weigh business interests and respect for the politics of the moment. “We need to strike a balance,” he said. Across the street, Winfred van Workum, general manager of the St. Regis, a luxury hotel at 16th and K streets, said noise from the plaza — there was a 3 a.m. soccer PHOTOS BY ASTRID RIECKEN FOR THE WASHINGTON POST TOP: A D.C. police officer joins a group jumping rope Thursday at Black Lives Matter Plaza.

BOTTOM; Occupy DC activist Mahadi Lawal, center, said yoga on the plaza is not a sign of defeat and promised more demonstrations. “They pat the letters down for us. This became a fashion trend. And now they turned it on us. ” Dawayne Wilkes, a protester, on D.C. officials’ move to disperse crowds on Black Lives Matter Plaza game and loud music one night — had prompted some of the few guests to check out early. And because 16th Street is blocked off, cars can’t enter the hotel’s semicircular semicircular driveway. “The types of business we get — foreign delegations — are not going going to want to stay here if they can’t line up the limos to go to the White House,” van Workum said. Dawayne Wilkes, 30, a protester protester who has been on the plaza for weeks, expressed little sympathy for the businesses, saying the mayor had encouraged a platform that the police and inspectors are now dismantling. “They put the letters down for us,” he said of the mural. “This became a fashion trend. And now they turned it on us.” ‘What could be better than this?’ On a hot afternoon, Woody Brown, 55, a procurement analyst from Springfield, wandered alone through the barren plaza. He held a yellow, rain-streaked “Black Lives Matter sign — his way of trying to keep a spotlight on all this,” he said. Brown compared the plaza to a Christo installation, a reference to the late conceptual artist whose projects included erecting 23 miles of gates in New York’s Central Park adorned in saffroncolored saffroncolored drapes. “It’s a piece of art,” Brown said. It did not begin that way. After Floyd’s death in late May, the corridor was center stage for protests and violent clashes between between demonstrators and police, including the altercation June 1 in which officers used tear gas to clear the area for Trump to pose for photographers in front of St. John’s. Once the street was renamed and the mural was unveiled, the lettering on the pavement drew visitors from far and wide. Bryan Coulbourn, 24, came from Bowie the other night to rollerblade as he listened to Marvin Gaye. “I’m in front of the White House with this shirt,” he said, imagining the photos he would post on social media of the “Black Owned Business” across his chest. ‘What could be better than this?” Luther Wright, 37, a local artist and muralist, considers the corridor corridor his “outdoor studio,” bringing his brushes and canvases to paint. He said he finds inspiration in the strangers he meets and the feeling feeling of common purpose. “I understand that they’re trying trying to get it back to normal, but it has become a historic place,” he said. “They should just embrace what it has become. Otherwise, what was the point of closing it off in the first place?” The activists still congregating on the plaza include Miranda Rosenfelt, who said she was among 15 or 20 protesters sleeping sleeping near H Street on the morning of July 6 when dozens of police officers swarmed in. As they broke up the encampment, officers officers confiscated tents and other supplies. Rosenfelt, 33, a chef, said she was bruised when an officer’s bike slammed into her. She said the police also used an earsplitting horn to disperse the crowd. “It has absolutely had a deflating deflating effect, and that’s the point,” she said of the tactics, as she walked through the plaza, a hard hat and safety glasses attached to her backpack. “It kept people from coming back.” As the sun set, she joined the yoga class, which began with the teacher, Aabi Abdun-Nafi, telling the gathering she would focus on their hips, the part of the body “where we hold a lot of our emotional emotional trauma.” A quiet settled in. No one appeared appeared to notice the man in a “Trump-Pence” mask who clattered clattered by on a skateboard. Or the passing heckler who shouted: “Brainwashed liberals! ” When the session ended, Mahadi Mahadi Lawal, 26, an Occupy DC activist, rose up from his mat, took the microphone and said no one should interpret yoga as “a sign of defeat, or, like, we’re just going to do yoga instead of protesting. protesting. Absolutely not.” He promised more demonstrations demonstrations in the coming days. “Keep fighting,” he said. “This is far from over.” paul.schwarztman @ washpost.com",7/21/2020,"('feels', 'like', 'the')","('the', 'whole', 'movement')","[' “It feels like the gentrification of the whole movement,” activist Nahom Demoz, 33, said as the yoga class assembled on the portion portion of the plaza where the yellow letters spell out “M-A-T-T-E-R.']", It feels like the gentrification of the whole movement activist Nahom Demoz 33 said as the yoga class assembled on the portion portion of the plaza where the yellow letters spell out MATTER
624,2450783788,"The voices of South Asian cooks are loud and clear on social media by Hira Qureshi When I was growing up, food was a source of pride and shame alike, a battle between the two that was intertwined with my dual identity: Pakistani American. In middle school in Memphis in the 2000s, my excitement as I watched my mother pack leftovers leftovers of saag and rice for my lunch became anxiety as I rushed to conceal them from my peers. While some of my favorite foods were my mother’s mutton biryani, aloo methi parathas and ras malai, I absorbed the otherness that came with White people’s judgment and a stigma around South Asian cuisine, and I let the shame override my pride in my culture’s food. In many ways, little has changed, and I still often find myself feeling “othered” about my food, especially when I look at Western food media. Despite the media’s attempts to reconcile grievances about stereotypes of foreign food, cooking from the wide-ranging South Asian diaspora diaspora is still too often presented as neither diversified nor accepted, but gentrified and singular — and desirable only when anointed by (White) Americans. Cookbook author and columnist columnist Alison Roman built a following following by taking such international ingredients as turmeric, cardamom cardamom and harissa and fitting them into a whitewashed aesthetic. Other American media rebranded haldi doodh into “golden milk” after turmeric lattes started popping popping up at coffee shops and on Instagram. A New York Times article article about Thai fruit drew outrage for trafficking in colonial and Orientalist Orientalist tropes. And at Bon Appetit, Appetit, with almost 6 million subscribers subscribers and over 1 billion total views on its popular YouTube channel, in the wake of editor Adam Rapport’s Rapport’s resignation, employees and contributors took to social media to call out the tokenizing and other other mistreatment of employees of color, among other issues. Although the magazine has South Asian representation in editor editor Sohla El-Waylly and contributor contributor Priya Krishna, recipes such as a gluten-free coconut turmeric pie and sweet-and-sour dal bhat still perpetuate the gentrification of South Asian staples.

Legacy food media has a long way to go toward addressing racial inequities. In the meantime, meantime, I have found hope in up-andcoming up-andcoming food personalities on social media, which seems to be a safer space for South Asian cooks to freely explore their range of skills and share their diasporic experiences. Hamza Gulzar, a 20-year-old aspiring pastry chef based in Chantilly, Va., started using Twitter Twitter and Instagram during quarantine quarantine to promote his cooking skills and share his recipes. Social media gives Gulzar, who, like me, is Pakistani American, the platform platform to bounce recipe ideas off his followers. When he watches videos from Bon Appetit and YouTube’s popular popular “Binging with Babish,” he notices the lack of diversity and a push for Eurocentric recipes. And that motivates him to “give more value and strength to Desi cuisine and Desi flavors” through his food, including Oreo ice cream samosas, chai souffles and mango MALI MA AH MAD Halima Ahmad of Atlanta, below, says she didn’t know how to make samosas before doing 30 kinds on Instagram. SAD I YAH AHMAD cake. First-generation Americans and immigrants, Gulzar said, “can create really interesting and different different ideas solely because of our experience that nobody else shares.” Fatima Shareef, a 25-year-old food personality based in Chicago, runs her brand, “Fatima’s Fabulous Fabulous Kitchen,” on Instagram and TikTok. She started it in 2017 to share such concepts as kulfi kreme doughnuts, Kashmiri chai boba and chaat fries, along with traditional Indian recipes. With 41,400 followers on TikTok, TikTok, Shareef showcases recipes that resonate with the Desi diaspora demographic she says is looking for representation. “Food culture is drastically changing,” Shareef said. “Social media changed everything. Food blogging was very different 10 years ago than what it is now, and 10 years from now it’s going to be very different. I think POC in general, general, we’re going through a renaissance renaissance for sure in terms of our diaspora culture.” RAIS AHMED MEHREEN KARIM Mehreen Karim of New York, top, tries to educate with her posts.

Her samosas included such flavor combinations as chicken and waffles, eggplant Parmesan, Parmesan, churros con chocolate ice cream, jalapeno poppers and knafeh. Her challenge became a community community conversation on Instagram Instagram and Twitter. All month, followers followers and random Instagram users shared her samosas on their stories and directly messaged Ahmad Ahmad with their ideas and praise. “I’m all about building a fun and inclusive food community that encourages other people to experiment with food—because if I can cook, anyone can,” Ahmad said. “I really feel that with the rise of POC sharing their food experiences experiences on social media.

This week, guests included columnist and cookbook author Cathy Barrow. Here are edited excerpts from that chat. Recipes Recipes whose names are capitalized can be found in our Recipe Finder at washingtonpost.com/recipes. Q: I have three rock-hard avocados avocados that aren’t softening. Are there tricks, or just be patient? A: The only trick I can think of is putting them in a paper bag, and even that one requires some patience patience if they’re really solid. — Kari Sonde A: You can also add an apple to the bag. Apples (as well as avocados) give off ethylene, which prompts ripening. The bag helps trap it, but the apple will provide a bit more. —Becky Krystal Q: In my quest to make everything that I have always wanted to make but didn’t have time to try, I have attempted arepas twice. I bought the arepa cornmeal and followed the directions; they were not great. The recipes say the batter should be on the moist side, and I think mine may have been too dry. Any tips? A: I love arepas! I’ve only made them once, so my only secrets to share are to make sure you’re using using masarepa, add a bit of oil to the dough (most recipes call for this), and don’t be afraid to add more water, a bit at a time, until the dough is a little bit sticky, like the consistency of Play-Doh. Then fry them in butter, which is like a moisture insurance policy. — G. Daniela Galarza Q: What is the best way to warm up lobster without turning it to rubber? Should you just eat it cold, or let it naturally warm up to room temperature? Something tells me that even 30 seconds in the microwave microwave would be a big mistake. A: I would eat it cold. I think it would get rubbery if you tried to reheat. If you absolutely cannot do cold lobster, maybe drizzle warm melted butter on it to warm it up? — OlgaMassov Q:I save up my raw food scraps in the freezer — root ends, trimmings, trimmings, peels, all the parts of the veggies that aren’t otherwise usable. usable. I use it to make vegetable broth in my Instant Pot, adding garlic and some dried herbs and spices. Then I wonder how to use all that vegetable broth.

Pierre L’Enfant’s plan for the city featured large blocks that developers developers subdivided into long, narrow residential lots with wealthy houses on the street-facing street-facing end and working-class settlements settlements on the alleys. “They were kind of medieval in character in contrast to the grand streets and avenues of D.Csaid Thor Nelson, deputy chief of planning, design and construction with the D.C. Housing Authority and former urban urban designer with the D.C. Office of Planning. The alley’s close quarters created vibrant community community life, but they were also places for stables, carriage houses and services no one wanted to see: animals, prostitutes and mechanical mechanical operations. “Alleys were designed to hide the messiness of life,” said Williams. Williams. But property owners recognized recognized they could make money by dividing the large lots and renting portions of them. “The alley dwellings that were built on these lots attracted the city’s poorest residents ... who couldn’t afford to live elsewhere,” she said. But once inhabited they were neglected. Housing stock was poor without proper infrastructure infrastructure and property owners didn’t maintain them. The alleys became became unsanitary and overcrowded. overcrowded. Nevertheless, they were tightknit tightknit communities that families called home, Williams said. Giorgio Furioso is a developer, real estate agent and artist who came to D.C. in the early 1980s looking for an affordable studio. He found suitable spaces in alley buildings but they weren’t legal to live or work in. He lobbied D.C. to change zoning zoning codes and after seven years, was successful in his effort. He bought several buildings, rented studios to artists and watched alleys turn into attractive sites for commerce and living. Today he retains one building, next to the Kahoe’s home, originally originally designed as community stable stable for horses and carriages. His studio is there and he rents space to another artist. Mark Lawrence, principal and co-founder of EL Studio, lives and works in a Northwest Washington alley. ‘We don’t have a front yard, so when our children, Spencer, 6, and Nash, 4, play, we put up orange orange cones in the intersections. Our friends on the block do the same. We kind of take ownership of the alley. You see scooters and balls and bicycles,” he said. When he and his wife, Cary, first walked down the alley, they thought it “a hidden world,” he recalled. We looked at a property and I saw a home and office. It was an old brick structure, previously a horse stable [some of the original original horse tie rings are visible inside] inside] and an outdoor space, a weed patch actually, but that’s what sold my wife.” GREG POWERS PHOTOGRAPHY A set of rowhouses in Southeast Washington are an example of from-the-ground-up contemporary architecture. The homes are on a vacant site previously occupied by seven worker homes from 1893. They bought the property in 2011, rebuilt the stable into a home, adjoining office and grassy courtyard. Nicholas Rubenstein and Jennifer Jennifer Hsu live next door. Their house facade looks like a garage because that’s what it is. The B. Frank Wright family, who owned a funeral home in Northwest Washington, built the original one-story garage in 1919, replacing a small two-story brick house built in 1882. We didn’t actually look for an alley house but knew we needed an unusually large space to accommodate accommodate our car collection,” said Rubenstein. “Our architect [Kube] envisioned maintaining the garage and building a two-story two-story home behind it.” The home is a full renovation of and addition of the original structure. structure. Kube created two facades. The garage facade sits on and opens to the alley street. The house facade sits inside the garage and is the rear glass wall of the garage connecting connecting it to the two-story living space. The kitchen on the back wall opens to the living and dining areas. Ceiling skylights cast natural natural light into the space. Rubenstein Rubenstein and Hsu can see their cars while sitting in the living room or working in their kitchen. A second-floor loft — reached by a steel staircase — is designed as a library and opens to an outdoor outdoor deck that can’t be seen from front of the building. “The alley is a chill place to live. Sometimes when I turn the corner late at night and it’s foggy I feel like I’ve gone back a hundred years,” said Hsu. Seven blue-and-green rowhouses rowhouses in Southeast Washington are an example of from-theground-up from-theground-up contemporary alley construction. The homes are on a vacant site previously occupied by seven worker homes from 1893. They were eventually torn down and the lots deemed unbuildable by D.C. Zoning, said Loosle-Ortega. Loosle-Ortega. In 2016, zoning codes were changed to allow residential construction construction in more types of alley sites. “An investor bought the corner lot, followed by four more and later the final two,” he said. “He contacted us to design homes.” We created one prototype emphasizing emphasizing light, space and flexible living. All units have a rear parking parking space that doubles as a patio, a green roof that doubles as garden and deck, second-floor balcony, and solar tubes that add natural lighting,” Loosle-Ortega said. Lamar Whitman and Dean Storer’s rowhouse on a tree-lined street in Northwest Washington isn’t typical alley living. Their alley alley runs behind the house parallel to the street. We wanted to connect the back of our house with the garage, create a new space for outdoor entertainment and liven up our small courtyard,” said Whitman. In stepped Kube Architecture. They built a deck on top of the garage and surrounded it on three sides with screen walls composed of perforated aluminum within a steel frame. These provide privacy from the outside, but transparency transparency and openness from inside. “The steel and other metal elements elements represent a modern way of building within an alley setting,” setting,” said Janet Bloomberg, cofounder cofounder and principal of Kube. “What’s interesting about D.C. alleys is they’re less formal than street-front architecture. The alley alley environment allowed us to introduce an industrial language into our design, which is atypical in the city because industrial buildings aren’t common,” she said. Theo Adamstein, sales associate associate with TTR Sotheby’s International International Realty and founder of Theo & Partners, also sees alleys through the architectural features they convey. “Historic alley buildings — stables, stables, carriage houses, warehouses — have high ceilings, expansive spaces with columns and beams, and tremendous volume that allows allows for horizontal plus vertical design. Those buildings are a blank 3-D canvas for design,” he said. “They’re like the industrial lofts in SoHo and Tribeca in Lower Manhattan.” Washington Alley Project Nelson is a longtime advocate of alley transformation. “Nowthat technology has progressed and we no longer have horses and carriages carriages or blacksmiths and stables, alleys alleys can revive community life. We can think anew about the space as a place for children to play and neighbors to socialize,” he said. EL Studio’s several-year Washington Washington Alley Project is doing exactly exactly that. Emerson and Lawrence study the city’s alley network as viable sites for new ways of urban living and using urban space. They recognize the success of pedestrian pedestrian spaces hinges on the offer offer of amenities, not just the removal removal of cars and trash. They’re working with residents, residents, city officials and neighborhood neighborhood leaders to find out how people people would like to transform alleys. “People told us, We want color, a playscape, softer surfaces, dedicated dedicated walkways and improved lighting,’ ” Emerson said. EL Studio organizes Alley Hops, self-guided walks through alleys. Armed with maps and 3-D viewfinders, folks amble through designated alleys aided by wayfinding wayfinding graphics on the walls and sidewalks. At designated spots, they look through the viewfinders and see the space where they’re standing in new and intriguing ways. They see sites overlaid with images of design interventions, like a raised platform to sit on, a basketball court surrounded by colorful wall murals, decorative sculptures, a performance stage and seating banquette, and vegetation. vegetation. “When we think about alley living and engaging in our public space, we see a convergence of our values — housing affordability, equity and racial justice, resiliency, resiliency, and how we can recover from covid,” said Anita Cozart, deputy director of community planning and design in the D.C. Office of Planning. “Now in the 21st century, century, we think alleys provide a range of different types of residential residential living.” Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are an example. They are new homes behind existing homes — and are a vehicle for homeowners to build rental units along alleys without triggering the need for major infrastructure investments. Water and sewer services typically come through the main house into an ADU. “That’s why ADUs are good for the city,” said Nelson. “They’re a place for affordable housing. One of the things that’s bedeviling about alleys reviving their role as equitable housing is that water and sewers aren’t there, so building building alley houses is prohibitively expensive.” EL Studio says if existing alley properties add alley housing there could be space for thousands thousands of new residents. Williams, the architectural historian, historian, warns that the city needs to be cognizant of the gentrification gentrification of alleys. “Over the course of several decades decades beginning in the late 19th century, White social reformers came along and began eradicating alley dwellings. The poor mostly Black population living there was displaced. That was the first gentrification,” gentrification,” she said. ‘Now we’re seeing the second gentrification with rich Whites, developers and individuals, coming in and rebuilding rebuilding alley structures.” Williams said alley revitalization revitalization needs to marry the two — refurbish existing housing stock and enable affordable living in new construction. “Alley lots are attracting attention attention and getting snatched up by developers and private home buyers,” buyers,” said Bloomberg of Kube. “By looking at them with a careful eye and thinking creatively about the possibilities of these unique sites, we can help improve our city now and for the future.” realestate @ washpost.com",1/16/2021,"('of', 'the', 'gentrification')","('alleys', 'over', 'the')","[' Williams, the architectural historian, historian, warns that the city needs to be cognizant of the gentrification gentrification of alleys.']", Williams the architectural historian historian warns that the city needs to be cognizant of the gentrification gentrification of alleys

966,2541597094,"MONICA HESSE New season of linin's ‘The Handmaid's Tale' is inspirational — and exhausting HESSE FROM Cl government-sponsored sexual slavery. It was about jolting the political conscience, not kicking viewers in the gut with depictions of sadism. The idea was to force us to confront the hows and whys of its dystopian premise. Why would America have allowed itself to be replaced by the Republic of Gilead? How would the new theocracy maintain control? Why are people motivated to see their own depraved actions as necessary? How does the unspeakable gradually become normal, and once it does, how does a society ever come back from that? The new season seems more interested in the what. What’s another way that women could be terrorized? What are some more ways after that? Have we had any scenes set in crisis pregnancy centers yet, where a woman seeking an abortion is pressured with scare tactics to keep an unwanted pregnancy? No? Okay, let’s throw one of those in. What about reappearances from villains who no longer serve the plot, but the actors are so great we can’t bear to fire them, so we just make them more cartoonishly evil? Nothing is left to the imagination. We see it all. The go-to defense for “The Handmaid’s Tale” has always been that it’s only reflecting reality. Women are raped, women are trafficked. In interviews, Atwood has said that all of the violence in her book had historical precedent; she kept files of news clippings and source material. But as the umpteenth bad thing happens to the jillionth sad woman, a viewer gets less wrapped up in the story itself and more in the ethics of watching it at all. When are we learning, and when are we leering? I don’t mind violence on television. I don’t mind violence against women on television, when it’s used to illustrate something profound about who we are as a society. I do mind it when the viewer most likely to get something out of the show is a serial killer jotting down ideas for his vision board. Part of the issue here is that our protagonist, June, has become defined by the traumatic things that have happened to her, and her bravery has become defined by how she, alone, can kick trauma in the gonads. She is trapped, she escapes; she is attacked, she fights back. There are bombs, there are missions carried out under hails of Kevin E. Thorne II and Molly Shayna Cohen in “Thirty-seven,” which tells the story of a restaurant worker and a census taker in Northeast Washington. Washington’s Theater Alliance devises a landmark piece for the Web THEATER REVIEW FROM Cl man’s bitterly funny Southeast satire, “Fundable.” The latter, a game show in which three heads of nonprofit groups in that financially financially hard-pressed sector of the city compete for a $100,000 grant, is infused with scathing irony: Though the host (a splendidly splendidly smarmy Dylan J. Fleming) and two of the contestants are Black, the deck seems stacked for the winner to be White. And isn’t that the all-too-familiar all-too-familiar way of the world? the play seems to ask. The exhilarating thrust of “City in Transition” is that this is a sweeping look at Washington through an entirely Black prism. Running through several of the pieces is a jaunJASPER jaunJASPER SAVAGE/HULU MERE WEISMILLER WALLACE/FOCUS FEATURES TOP: From left, Nina Kiri, Victoria Goodman, Masa Lizdek, Elisabeth Moss, Bahia Watson, Melissa Kelly and Madeline Brewer in “The Handmaid’s Tale.” ABOVE: Carey Mulligan in the film “Promising Young Woman.” gunfire. She lifts her red handmaid’s hood like a superhero’s cape, she glares into the camera and lives to fight another day. It’s inspirational, and it’s diced, scalding eye on the intrusions intrusions of a White world in a city that has been racially riven for decades. In Scott-Jones’s sharply drawn “Thirty-seven,” the Northeast Northeast play, an earnest White census census taker played by Molly Shayna Cohen comes to the apartment of a Black restaurant worker portrayed portrayed by Kevin E. Thorne II. At his kitchen table, Thorne’s Seth and Cohen’s Caroline engage engage in a civil battle of nerves, as Caroline tries to impress upon Seth the value of his being counted, counted, while Seth tests the thickness of her do-gooding shell with cynical evasiveness. “Do you live here alone?” she asks. “Sometimes,” he replies. “What is your occupation?” exhausting. When a woman’s pain is presented as the most interesting thing about her, her story line requires the pain. So it is with June, who during the first three she asks. “Field hand,” he replies. With the help of photography directors Kelly Colburn and Dylan Dylan Uremovich, and technical and art director Jonathan Dahm Robertson, Caldwell uses a variety variety of effects and tools, such as vintage black-and-white photographs photographs and bold graphics, to give each story a visual personality. Washington sights such as Anacostia’s Anacostia’s Big Chair make cameos, too. A few narrative lumps do rise along the way in this ambitious ambitious stew, particularly in Collins’s Collins’s “Big Fish,” the Southwest story, about the shooting death of a rapper; some of the plot gets lost in the patchwork approach. And inconsistencies in memorization memorization — you can see some actors’ seasons turned down multiple opportunities to escape to Canada. The stated reason is that she needs to remain in Gilead to search for her older daughter; the real reason seems to be that PHOTOS BY THEATER ALLIANCE “Big Fish,” which stars Emmanuel Kye-Baffour, left, Morgan Charece, and Charles Franklin IV, chronicles the shooting death of a rapper in Southwest Washington. eyes wander to strategically placed scripts — prove occasional occasional distractions. But the scale and scope of this endeavor — 19 actors, five editors, editors, six visual effects people, two costume designers and music by the Curious Music Company — attest to a grand effort to broaden broaden the theatrical conversation in Washington. The city’s theaters have been handsomely upgraded and improved over the past 20 years, but the attendant gentrification gentrification of city neighborhoods has barely registered as a theme on those stages. “City in Transition” attempts to jog the memories of longtime Washingtonians by tracing in “Child’s Place” the history of a Black-owned restaurant in the show might not know what to do with a liberated June. Recovery isn’t as cinematic as struggle. It’s messy and slow and doesn’t often involve doing a hero’s run away from the Northwest that has been passed down to a new generation, in the guise of Llogan Peters’s Tiffany. She has plans to gut-renovate the space, in keeping with the rehab of the rest of the block. But she herself is unaware of what her forebears went through, building a Black business in a neighborhood neighborhood that did not welcome them. So it is left to her grandmother Deidre, played in wonderfully resonant fashion by Kelsey Delemar, Delemar, to instruct her — and us. The flashbacks to the 1950s remind audiences of the uphill struggle of Black ambition, and the deep scars that were incurred by those who aspired, even in a place that carried the nickname Chocolate City. The production’s title is thereexploding thereexploding Capitol of a totalitarian regime. Maybe my current frustration with “The Handmaid’s Tale” is that the show is giving us waterboarding scenes while other scripts move the conversation about women, violence and society into new areas. In “Promising Young Woman,” Carey Mulligan’s Cassie tries to avenge her friend’s sexual assault in a way that ends up exploring issues of guilt and culpability, in a way that shows how even a righteous desire for vengeance can erode the soul. In the world of that movie, bravery has absolutely nothing to do with how many discrete traumas episodes a character can endure, or even whether she survives in the end. In HBO’s “I May Destroy You,” an aspiring writer spends the entire season unpacking and repacking the night of her sexual assault in a bar, trying to remember it, make sense of it, and understand what it did to her. In the show’s final episode, she envisions multiple different versions of confronting her attacker — some of them outlandishly vigilante-ish, some of them poignant and radically compassionate. Those stories showed me something I rarely see onscreen: onscreen: worlds where violence against women was a starting point but not the main point. Where women moved on, or didn’t, when the violence was over. Where the leading women were interesting for reasons other than the fact that they’d been victimized by terrible men. Toward the end of the Season 4 episodes of “Handmaid’s Tale” made available for review — I watched seven, and seriously, the vaguest of spoilers — something happens to June that puts her in a different spot than she’s been in for the bulk of the series. She is finally in a place where she might be able to recover, and I found myself wondering — would the show let her? Would the remainder of the series do the hard work of showing June at rest? Or would she again throw herself into a lion’s den? The thing is, whether your show is a sci-fi dystopian drama, a dark revenge comedy or a prestige limited HBO series, it’s actually not difficult to concoct scenes of women in peril. It’s much harder to come up with scenes of women being left alone. monica.hesse@washpost.com Monica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.

Written by and starring Bay Area natives Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) and Rafael Casal, who play best friends with contrasting approaches to the breakneck gentrification of their hometown of Oakland, Calif., the formally and thematically thematically ambitious film showcased fresh talent (especially those of newcomer Casal and first-time director Carlos Lopez Estrada) while tackling issues of police violence, class resentment and toxic masculinity. If it felt a bit overstuffed for a 95-minute feature, well, that mostly felt like a positive: Better to have too much to say than too little. But even in these sequel- and reboot-obsessed reboot-obsessed times, “Blindspotting” isn’t the most intuitive pick for a TV adaptation, with a box-office gross of just $5 million. Thankfully, Starz recognized that there was more than enough material for an eight-part season, which debuts Sunday.

Like “The Martian” and “Artemis,” the book has a propulsive propulsive story line and is filled with the cool science science and witty banter you expect from Weir, a software engineer who turned his love of aero- aero- space and the hard sciences sciences into a cottage industry. industry. In his latest outing, Weir uses a common SF trope — a protagonist who must discover who he is and what’s going on, and oh, also save humanity. It’s a fun idea, and Weir knows how to ratchet up the excitement, but the novel seems written to be a movie (and in fact is being made into one, starring Ryan Gosling). Perhaps just wait for that? A friend of mine, who teaches scriptwriting, scriptwriting, talks about “refrigerator logic” — elements elements that don’t bother you until after a movie is over and you go to the refrigerator and say, “Hey... wait a minute.” Refrigerator logic is even worse in a novel — you have a lot more time to sit with the book in real time and scratch your head about the plot points and characterizations that don’t quite make sense, even in speculative fiction.

After all, their best-friend dynamic is part of what has brought an enormous number of listeners to “Fake Doctors, Real Friends,” the iHeartRadio podcast (available on every podcast platform) that launched last year. The show features Braff and Faison re-watching each episode of “Scrubs,” NBC’s beloved — if eternally underappreciated — medical comedy that ran from 2001 through 2010. “Fake Doctors” is now one in a series of popular early 2000s re-watch podcasts hosted by the show’s actors themselves, 2005 PHOTO BY MATT SAYLES/ASSOCIATED PRESS Donald Faison, left, with Zach Braff, says “Fake Doctors, Real Friends” has opened doors for him. “Since we started this podcast, I've gotten a hunch of offers for things which didn't necessarily come before,” Faison says. from “Office Ladies” to “Welcome to the O.C., Bitches” to “West Wing Weekly.” The surge of these podcasts has led to new opportunities for its stars, as well. Braff and Faison are achieving one small dream this weekend, as they — as well as Monique and Goodman, integral personalities on the podcast, and “Scrubs” creator Bill Lawrence, who has become a fan-favorite fan-favorite guest — will appear on “Celebrity Family Feud” on ABC on Sunday night. They’re all longtime “Family Feud” fans, and Braff was desperate to give an answer so terrible that it would result in host Steve Harvey’s classic deadpan stare to the camera. (Instead it was Goodman who offered one such answer.) But Faison, best known as Dionne’s boyfriend, Murray, in “Clueless” and football player Petey Jones in “Remember the Titans,” said that he has been offered more roles than usual in the past year. “I’m very grateful for how my career has switched a bit. Since we started this podcast, I’ve gotten a bunch of offers for things which didn’t necessarily come before. And I sold something for the first time, which I had never done,” he said. “I think it’s appealing to other people in the industry, where they might have said, Tbu know, I don’t know if I want to go with Donald Faison.’ Now they’re like, We listen to his podcast, and he’s funny... so why not?’ ” The appeal of these podcasts banks on our culture’s early-2000s-nostalgia obsession, but “Scrubs” fans probably probably flock to “Fake Doctors” because of Braff and Faison, whose characters’ friendship mirrors their real-life relaSEE relaSEE SCRUBS ON C2",6/12/2021,"('to', 'the', 'breakneck')","('their', 'hometown', 'of')","[' Written by and starring Bay Area natives Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) and Rafael Casal, who play best friends with contrasting approaches to the breakneck gentrification of their hometown of Oakland, Calif.']", Written by and starring Bay Area natives Daveed Diggs Hamilton and Rafael Casal who play best friends with contrasting approaches to the breakneck gentrification of their hometown of Oakland Calif
