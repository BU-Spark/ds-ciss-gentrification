SANDY BANKS If you ask young parents parents in downtown’s downtown’s South Park area nearL.A. Live what their neighborhood needs, it’s a decent elementary elementary school, not a professional professional football team. The city ?s revitalized historic core has become a way-station for up and comers, who move to downtown downtown for the night life, the arts, the commute, the cachet... then move out when their children are bom. “You love it here,? said Chinmaya Misra, who lives with her husband and daughter in an airy loft in a century-old building at 7th and Olive. “But you look around and realize, ‘where am I going to educate my child?’? For many the answer is somewhere else — Silver Lake, Mt. Washington, South Pasadena. ?A lot of our friends have moved for one reason: the schools.” Misra said. Others have opted to commute, driving their children to the high-performing high-performing Solano Avenue j Elementary near Dodger i Stadium, three miles away. But for a small corps of parents, whose friendships blossomed on weekend outings at their tiny neighborhood neighborhood park, t he idea of a good school their children can walk to is too important to give up. They have the sort of skills you?d expect in a young, well-educated crew. There’s a financial advisor, an urban development expert, a software designer, an educator and a couple of architects. And they’re marshaling those talents to try to launch a charter elementary school that would open in downtown next fall. “It was sort of naive to begin with; just a couple of parents meeting at the park, bonding over our children.? said Misra. who sits on the prospective charter’s board with her husband, architect Apurva Pande. In eight months of weekly play group/dinner party sessions. Metro Charter Charter has evolved from a playground playground dream to a 150-page proposal, submitted for Los Angeles Unified School District approval two weeks ago. The school board will hold a public hearing in November and make its decision by early next year. Even with approval, though, the school looks like a longshot.

A September opening would mean a kindergarten spot for 4-year-old Anvaya. But she wants more than a good education for her daughter; she wants to strengthen the bonds that neighborhood families have built through park outings and birthday parties over the years. “Ifyou asked me six years back, when we sold our house in Culver City and moved downtown, ‘Do you think you’d stay in downtown downtown after you had a child?’ ... I would have said no,? Misra told me. She’s been surprised by the pull of neighborhood ties — and the revelation that friendships among children can make allies of parents. There are two elementary elementary schools within walking distance of South Park, serving a population that straddles skid row and the industrial garment district. Para Los Ninos runs a charter school where achievement is rising. But 99% of its students are Latino, 100% are ?socioeconomically ?socioeconomically disadvantaged” disadvantaged” and two-thirds are not fluent in English. Nearby. Nearby. on the edge of skid row, a rebuilt Ninth Street Elementary Elementary — once a collection of bungalows — will reopen in September, drawing many of its students from rundown residential motels and homeless shelters. “The performance there has been frighteningly poor,” said Mike McGalliard, McGalliard, who once headed the school reform group LA’s Promise and now lives in South Park with his wife and young daughter and sits on the board of Metro Charter. ?None of us want to subject our children to that.” Does that make the South Park crowd snobs? I don’t think so. But some do. “We’ve already been criticized in the Twittersphere” Twittersphere” by people who suspect a new school would try to weed the “brown kids” out. McGalliard said. Even some of the parents involved worry that their effort could veer into the sort of social redlining that would insulate their children children from the realities of what they consider “urban living.? ?Multiethnic is a draw for me,” said Jared Birdsong, who has a 3 ‘/.-year-old daughter with wife Sonia Salinas. “I’m concerned that downtown could become become a little bit of the Westside Westside on the Eastside,” he said. And the school could become “an enclave of affluence affluence that shelters us and * keeps us from connecting.” Part of the problem is that downtown is exceptionally exceptionally fractionalized — the hip. middle-income loft and high-rise crowd versus the people trapped on skid row and the immigrants crammed into decrepit apartments. The newcomers are driving development. They see a successful charter school as an investment — a way to push property values higher and attract longterm longterm residents. “Without it. this will always be a community in transition,? said Misra, who works as a designer at a downtown architectural firm. “It will be t he thing you do before ’real life’ — move to downtown, have your fun, have a baby, and when your child turns 3. you move on. .. That’s not a sustainable model.” But it’s a charged situation. situation. the educational equivalent of gentrification of housing. Metro Charter families would be following the lead of parents in other mixed-income areas, like Hollywood and Larchmont. where disaffected parents launched their own charter schools, creating yuppie niches in largely immigrant neighborhoods. Some see that as the downside of the charter movement; it siphons off progressive, moneyed, educated parents who create versions of diversity that they are comfortable with. But others see it as the salvation of public schools; a way to keep middle-class families from fleeing for private options. McGalliard said Metro Charter is determined to reflect the diversity of downtown, downtown, which census figures show is now almost evenly divided among whites, blacks. Latinos and Asian Americans. The school’s founding board is a portrait of ethnic diversity. But the economic part of that equation may be harder to manage. “It hasn’t been easy, and it won’t be.?’ Misra acknowl edged. But “this is about really belonging to this community and feeling that you gave something back.” sandy.banks ui latimes.com",10/23/2012,"('educational', 'equivalent', 'of')","('housing', 'metro', 'charter')",[' the educational equivalent of gentrification of housing.'], the educational equivalent of gentrification of housing

By Steve Carney Regular listeners to the “Kevin ? Bean? morning show on KROQ-FM (106.7) know better than to believe everything they hear on the comedy program — whether it’s about the opening of a Mall of America West, or basketball star Karl Malone playing Santa. But the topic Thursday was as serious, and personal, as life and death. Gene “Bean” Baxter announced announced that he’s donating a kidney to longtime KROQ DJ and chief engineer Scott Mason, who first underwent a t ransplant in 1999, and has been on dialysis since that kidney started to fail in 2010. Baxter said he noticed Mason’s poor health in April, when the latter came to Seattle Seattle to do some work on the home studio where Baxter works during the show, which airs 5-10 a.m. weekdays weekdays on the alternative music music station. The reticent Mason Mason divulged his situation, and as the two chatted about live donations, Baxter said he decided to help. “It wasn?t a big. like, emotional emotional decision for me to offer my kidney up to Scott.? Bax ter said on the air Thursday. “It was a math problem for me. It was. ‘You have zero and I have two; well, why don’t I just give you one?’ And that just made sense.? ?You guys have made fun of me for a long time for not being emotional.? Baxter said, to which partner Kevin Ryder cut in. “It’s a good thing he doesn?t need a heart, because he’d have to go somewhere else.? Baxter and Mason spent a large chunk of the program Thursday educating listeners listeners about kidney function and organ donation. Mason said his low red blood cell count has him so sapped of energy, he can’t even walk up a single flight of stairs without without exhaustion.

Baxter said later that he?s been a registered organ donor since he got his first driver?s license, but hadn’t thought about live donation until now. ?To me. it doesn?t even seem like that big a deal.? he said, compared to Mason?s otherwise bleak outlook.

Some people worry that a planned revamp of the Grand Central Market could drive out such tenants and destroy its authenticity. PERSPECTIVE Bullish on an iconic market Grand Central makeover could mean a fun mix of old and new By Gale Holland At 9 a.m. sharp, the man in the blue blazer swung a brass bell over his head, a rite that dates back to the Grand Central Market’s opening day in 1917. A minute minute later, nearly every swivel chair at the China Cafe counter was filled, mostly by older men hunched over bowls of wonton soup. “It’s not a fancy piace,? said Concepcion Orellano. 57. ?People come here because because they are poor.” Owner Rinco Cheung, an experienced restaurateur and Hong Kong native, confided he didn?t know what chop suey was until he took over China Cafe from his wife’s cousin last year. “It?s very old-style,? Cheung said, pointing out the menu boards overhead, which list several “egg fo yeung? dishes the owner also didn’t recognize. “They love it like that.? he added. Which is precisely the problem. I too love the Grand Central Market: its Beaux Arts touches, the flowing script of the neon signs at each stall, the weird store names — “Jones Grain Mill? — the exposed pipes and pendant light fixtures. And I’m a fan of the back-in-the-day comfort food and retro prices in the cavernous food hall between Broadway and Hill streets. On Friday, (small) avocados were on sale at one of the produce stands seven for$l, and Jose’s Ice Cream Comer had cones for $1.50. The market, with its mix of Mexican. Chinese. Japanese and Middle Eastern food, is one of the last holdouts of the $5-or-less lunch plate in downtown Los Angeles. But landmarks cannot live on nostalgia alone. And even the most militant preservationist has to see it?s time to shake up the venerable food emporium. Downtown’s population has exploded, but the Grand Central Market clearly is failing to bring in many of its new. upscale urbanistas. Last week. I saw more vacant vacant space than I can remember remember at any point in the last decade. Alarms went off after The Times reported on the planned makeover by Adele Yellin, president of the development company started by her late husband. Ira. The news bounced around the blogosphere. drawing complaints about a loss of authenticity. Times staff writer Joseph Sema denounced the gentrification gentrification of the “people’s market.? market.? The minds behind the chichi Ferry Building, a foodie mecca in San Francisco. Francisco. are involved; a consultant consultant told Times reporter Betty Hallock his “fantasy? is a pocket cafe or sushi bar under the stairs. The consternation seems somewhat misplaced. The basement’s tenants now are a passport photo place and one of those ubiquitous 99-cent-style discount stores; I doubt they?ll be missed much. But our history of slashand-bum slashand-bum urban renewal does not give comfort. It brings to mind the Vietnam War tag line: We had to destroy the village to save it. Bunker Hill was flattened. flattened. Nothing was preserved preserved of the magnificent Ambassador Hotel when Los Angeles Unified converted converted it to a public school. Instead, the district built kitschy facsimiles of the hotel’s Paul R. Williamsdesigned Williamsdesigned coffee shop and Cocoanut Grove nightclub. Theonce-giamorous Brown Derby icon sits atop a strip mall in Koreatown, robbed of any history or meaning. I talked to Yellin and her developer. Rick Moses, and I believe they are sincere about maintaining the character of the market. After all. her late husband kept his promise not to make the place “Westside cute” during an earlier overhaul in the 1990s. The changes thus far are modest: modest: the sawdust was removed, removed, and the floors, pipes and ceiling are being scrubbed scrubbed and polished. “Yes. we want to clean it up. but we don’t want to change the feel of it,? Moses told me. But how about also committing to structuring rents so that at least some portion of the market?s offerings remain affordable? It?s only fair. The public has a sizable stake in the Grand Central Market. Local agencies financed $44 million in bonds for Ira Yellin’s renovation of the historic market and the Homer Laughlin Building above it. The market today still owes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the now-deftjnct L.A. Community Redevelopment Redevelopment Agency $32 million. Moses said. People come downtown not simply for its historic charm, but because it’s a beautiful mess — a hodgepodge hodgepodge of what came before. what’s hot now. grit, glitz and authenticity. Retired computer systems systems engineer Daniel Kerr took the train in from San Clemente to visit the China Cafe on Friday for the wonton wonton soup but also to take in the act ion. ?I like city life.? he said. “There’s so much to see and to do. it’s just interesting.? Being on a Fixed income, he’ll probably have to cut back on the China Cafe if a meal there goes up to $10 or more, he said. “I think it’s so cool here.? said Adrian Aguilar. 25. an El Monte native who recently recently moved into a loft • downtown. “I love sushi, but this is just like straight from the streets of L.A.? Aguilar, tattooed and dressed head to toe in black, said he had musician friends coming in from New York and was “all excited to bring them to places like this.? Moses and Yellin say there is no intention to purge existing tenants, just to fill the holes. As a sign of good faith, they recently signed Las Morelianas. of pig snout taco fame, to a new lease. Cheung kept the old menu and employees when he took over the China Cafe. This, along with his beer license, the only one in the market, undoubtedly helped him hang on to old customers. He has high hopes the new style can blend with the old. “Why not mix it all together?? he said.

Francike Orr Los Angrlrs Times CHEF ALEX WESTPHAL, front left, works with staff in the kitchen at Cortez, which may divide diners, and whose dishes diners may find difficult to divide. COUNTER INTELLIGENCE Portion control taken to extremes JONATHAN GOLD RESTAURANT CRITIC What you think about Cortez is going to depend in large part on what you think about crowds, and noise, and screechy jazz, about well-meaning servers who are slightly impatient with the idea of service, and about spending most of an hour leaning up against a shoe box-narrow windowsill waiting waiting for a seat to open up. If the idea of crashing a dinner party at the apartment of a friend of a friend sounds appealing, you’re probably going to have a good time here. If the idea sounds appalling, you are going to be miserable, and nothing I say about the saffrontinged saffrontinged cauliflower with chopped green olives or the arugula-fennel salad with pickled sardines is going to change your mind. There are times when it seems romantic to park three blocks away from an unmarked restaurant where the front of the house is run by a poet and expensive wine is served in juice glasses. There are times when you are glad the maitre d‘ at Lucques knows your name. These moods tend not to overlap. Cortez is the project of Marta Teegan and Robert Stelzner of Cookbook, a small, expensive grocery grocery that is usually Exhibit A when locals start arguing about the gentrification gentrification of Echo Park. Some locals locals are appalled that their neighborhood neighborhood includes a store where Rancho Gordo beans sell for five times the price of the pinto beans Today’s restaurant phone order? Hangup. More places are asking diners to curb cellphone use, saying it disturbs others and slows service. But some let freedom ring. By Randye Hoder For the past 2 ?A years, Bill Miller of Malibu Kitchen has had a hard-and-fast rule at his upscale deli: If you’re on your cellphone whenyou reach the head of the line, he won?t serve you. In fact, he?s posted a prominent sign at the counter: “You decide which is more important. Ordering food or talking on the cellphone. You won?t be waited on until the phone is off and put away.? That, he says, has earned him a reputation as the “Deli Nazi.” Eva. a 42-seat eatery on Beverly Boulevard, made headlines last summer when it decided on a softer softer approach to curbing cellular use — offering its customers a 5% discount discount off their meal for turning in their phones at the door. ABC News, public radio’s “Marketplace? and the New York Daily News, among many others, covered the announcement. But six months later, nothing has changed.

It even offers a universal chargor for its customers. and Eva are hardly the only restaurants restaurants around town that are trying to cope with diners who use. if not abuse, their cellphones. Some customers customers talk so loudly they disturb those around them. Others keep wait staff on hold at a table while finishing up a call, thus disrupting service for everyone. Some even return return food that has cooled while they were busy talking on their phones. That?s why some restaurants have laid down the law.

So it is not surprising just that Cortez, whose chef is Portland.

Joan’s on Third, the gourmet gourmet marketplace, tells patrons; ?Please finish your phone call be fore ordering.? Some customers have actually taken to policing themselves. In a game called Phone Stack, restaurant restaurant guests lay their phones upside down on the table and can?t touch them duringthe meal. If picking up the phone proves irresistible for someone, he or she has to pay the check for the whole group. In most situations, though, it with pureed herbs will not harbor a hidden mince of ham. But I believe that Cortez could be where the small-plates trend meets its Verdun, where the size of its portions, at least the non-vegan ones, makes the usual sort of small-plates sharing almost impossible. impossible. yet the way the menu is structured makes it impossible to order conventional starters and main courses.

White Chrysler Group said it would recall 630,000 Jeep SUVs for transmission and restraint-system problems just two days after it refused a federal request to recall 2.7 million vehicles for faulty fuel systems. In the U.S., the automaker automaker will recall 254,000 Compass Compass and Patriot SUVs from model years 2010 to 2012.

What’s clear at this point is that the top-secret Foreign Foreign Intelligence Surveil lance Court gave the NSA permission in late April to collect the information, which apparently includes phone numbers and call durations but not the content content of the calls. The Obama adminis tration said Thursday that the data collection “has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States.? For consumers, that makes things tricky. Who are we to second-guess the highest levels of government about national security? It’s fair to assume that the president president knows things we don’t about potential threats to our well-being. Moreover, it’s not as though the big telecom companies didn?t wam us this could happen. Verizon Wireless, for example, says in its customer customer contract that even if you opt out from having personal information shared with others, the company still may do so “to comply with any laws, court order or subpoena.?

At the same time, Richards Richards said, it’s important that limits be placed on such efforts. “The idea is that government government officials shouldn?t be able to get everything,? he said. “There should be a process that requires the government to be accountable accountable and to prove that they need this information.?

Yet those same misdeeds have, to some extent, made Americans indifferent to privacy concerns. “There have been so many scandals and so many security breaches, people have come to expect that their information will get out,? said Larry Ponemon, founder of the privacy-focused privacy-focused Ponemon Institute.

That contrasts contrasts with a mere 8% decline decline for households of those 35 and older. But the younger younger adults accomplished that admirable feat mainly by owning fewer homes and cars. Questions over the finances finances of young adults have contributed to recent mood swings and mixed signals in the home-building industry, along with concerns over the costs of materials, land and labor. The National Assn, of Home Builders/Wells Fargo survey said builder confidence confidence jumped three points in May to 44 — but readings under 50 mean the consen sus outlook is still poor. Housing starts topped 1 million million in March for the first time in nearly five years before before falling in April, but that’s far below the historical historical monthly average of 1.5 million starts. Meanwhile, student debt has risen eightfold, to an average average of $26,000, with many young adults owing six figures figures by the time they begin looking for jobs, Winograd said. One result is that millennials millennials are “very much value buyers,” Winograd said. Three-quarters of them say they need “essentials,” not a luxury home, although they are also tech-oriented, interested interested in home theaters and fast Internet connections. How are they going to afford afford homes? “They’re going to buy fixer-uppers. They’re into do-it-yourself,” Winograd said. “And many will only be able to afford a fixer-upper.?

MONEY TALK How credit card fraud can mess up auto-payments By Liz Weston Dear Liz: We’ve had three cases of credit card fraud. Each time, the credit card company issued new cards with new numbers and canceled the old ones (along with the fraudulent charges). We had nine monthly auto-payment authorizations set up, and we seethed at the fact that the card company would not offer to authorize our auto-payments via the new numbers. We eventually received late-payment notices and charges, since the old numbers were still on the record with payees. Are there companies that offer updates to payees when cards are canceled, and new ones issued, in such fraud situations? Answer: Given all the database database breaches lately, automatic automatic updat es to autopayments autopayments might come in handy. But it seems you’re on I your own. Your agreements i with your billers typically ! state that you?re required to i update them whenever a . card expires or its number | changes. Many billers will alert you when an expirat expirat ion date is near or if a charge doesn?t go through, but ultimately it’s your responsibility to keep track. It’s a good idea to keep a list of your auto-payments so you don’t forget to update them all when this happens again. If you don’t have a list, simply checkingyour past statements should remind you which accounts are on auto-pay. Must veterans get Obamacare? Dear Liz: My brother is a Vietnam veteran. Every month since his separation from the Navy in 1969. he has had a monthly premium deducted from his pay and sent to the Veterans Administration Administration for his medical insurance coverage. Last month he received a notice from his employer stating that if he doesn’t sign up and pay premiums under the Affordable Care Act. he will be fined for not having medical insurance. How can this be? He goes to the VA for all of his medical needs. Can this truly be correct? Answer: People enrolled in VA healthcare don’t have to sign up for additional health insurance or pay additional premiums. Their VA coverage coverage meets the Affordable Care Act’s requirements for coverage. Your brother’s employer may have sent out a general notice to all employees about the law. rather than one that reflects his individual individual situation. If the employer employer believes that VA coverage doesn’t qualify, it should be alerted to this page on the VA site: www.va.gov/health; aca/. Pension reduces Social Security Dear Liz: As a faculty member member who was only recently allowed to participate in our state’s public employees’ retirement system, I will have a very small pension. I’m told that Social Security will then reduce my benefit by up to 50% as a result of the so-called windfall elimination elimination provision. Can you tell me how this is legal? Answer: Many people affected affected by Social Security?s windfall elimination provision provision are outraged that their benefits will be reduced. Before the provision was enacted in 1983. though, people who paid less into the Social Security system wound up getting an outsized outsized benefit. Here’s why. Social Security Security is designed to replace more of a worker’s income the less he or she makes, with the understanding that saving for retirement is harder the lower your income. income. When you get a pension from an employer who doesn’t pay into the Social Security system, but you also qualify for Social Security Security benefits from other jobs, your Social Security earnings earnings record can look as if you were a long-term, low-wage worker even when you’re not. Without the windfall elimination provision, you could wind up with a Social Security check that replaces more of your income than you would have received had you only worked in jobs covered by Social Security. How much your benefit will be reduced depends in part on how many years you worked in those other jobs — the ones that were covered covered by Social Security. The longer you worked at jobs covered by Social Security, the less the windfall elimination elimination provision affects you, as long as you had “substantial earnings? from those jobs. The amount that’s considered considered substantial varies by year, ranging from $3,300 in 1974 to $21,750 this year. You’ll experience the maximum maximum 50% reduction if you have 20 or fewer years of substantial earnings. If you have 30 years of such earnings, earnings, the provision doesn’t affect you at all.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE Good ol’ American food, updated JONATHAN GOLD RESTAURANT CR1TIC When people ask about the modem modem way of eating in Los Angeles, the succession of wildly variant small plates followed perhaps by a big. shared platter of meat. I sometimes refer them to Josef Centeno, who got the style started here when he was chef of the long-defunct Koreatown restaurant Opus a decade or so ago. Other chefs had done the neo-tapas thing here before, of course, including including Sang Yoon at Father’s Office and Suzanne Goin at AOC, but Centeno was somehow more aggressive about it, careening back and forth from Asian to Mediterranean to Latin American flavors and structures. structures. many of the dishes emphasizing emphasizing vegetables instead of meat or fish, all of them congenial to a cocktail cocktail or an odd glass of wine. His term at Opus ended with a kind of endless tasting menu, as many small courses as you cared to eat for 10 bucks a plate. He made haute cuisine accessible to a lot of people who couldn?t imagine going to a place like Spago, the French Laundry or Melisse. It was the furthest furthest thing from a burger bar. Centeno, as you probably know, is now a baron of downtown dining, and the bit of real estate around 4th and Main, where he owns the restaurants restaurants Bar Amd. Orsa ? Winston and Baco Mercat, is occasionally referred referred to as Centenoland.

NV Bele Casel Prosecco (Veneto, Italy). About $15. Another extra-dry Prosecco from a small estate that sources the grapes from some of the appellation’s best vineyards. Beautiful, creamy texture and a delicate scent of pear make this one a natural for the holiday table. Schramsberg “Mlrabelle” California Ros6 (California). About $20.

Centeno’s Pete’s was a place where the chalkboard menu listed things like beef tongue salad and caramelized sunchoke remoulade, and the size of the steak went down from 32 ounces to 4. At the old Pete’s, you could have a Michelob with your short-ribs instead of a bottle of Dieu du Ciel peppercorn rye. Pete’s wasn’t quite a dive — it had pancetta-wrapped .scallops and pappardelle with lamb — but it was a neighborhood restaurant, a AFP/Ortly ImiiRP* price from the historic Schramsberg house in Napa Valley.

I noticed after the fourth time I had been in that I tended to start every meal with a plate of raw and grilled seasonal vegetables and Roederer Estate in Anderson Valley in Mendocino County has a subtle elegance that draws you in. Crisp and fresh, the L’Ermltage brut exhibits a fine mousse and an inviting bouquet of sweet spices and lemon. This tastes much more expensive than its price tag. NV Hubert Meyer Clamant d’Alsace Rose (Alsace, France). About $18. Alsace Alsace may be better known for thrilling Riesling, Gewiirztraminer and Tokay Pinot Gris, but the region on the border with Germany also produces some fine sparkling wines called Cremant d?Alsace. Hubert Meyer makes one of the best, especially the 100% Pinot Nolr ros£ with a delicate scent of wild strawberries. These undervalued M6thode Champenolse Champenolse wines are worth seeking out as a Champagne alternative. NV Alllmant-Laugner Brut Ros4 Cr£mant Cr£mant d’Alsace (Alsace, France). About $20. The ros6 from Alllmant-Laugner Is another Cremant d?Alsace worth stocking stocking up on for the holidays. The color is so pretty, why not serve it as an aperitif with smoked salmon or trout? NV Louis Boulllot Perle D’Aurore Brut Rose Cremant De Bourgogne (Burgundy, (Burgundy, France). About $13. Burgundy has a tradition of cremant too. and since this is Pinot Nolr territory, of course much of it is ros6. This one comes from the ntgociant Louis Bouillot, whose history in the region goes back to 1877. At this price, you might expect something Innocuous, but Boulllot’s cremant ros£ offers complexity, character and a touch of Burgundian earthlness.

The vegetables were fairly spectacular, spectacular, of course, a long plank with blistered okra, charred stems of broccolini and grilled puntarelle, along with half a dozen other things, arranged into a composition that might have tempted Chardin to pick up his brush. The brandy old-fashioned, old-fashioned, a cocktail I have never seen outside the Upper Midwest, was served in a glass mounded above the rim with super-cold crushed ice — it would have been a hit at any Elks Lodge in Racine. Afterward there might have been fried butterball butterball potatoes with pears and grapes, chicken meatballs in cream, a tower of crisp-edged braised beef tongue stacked into a Jenga formation with apples, or a plate of Mrs. G.W. Sanborn’s Sanborn’s shrimp with lightly boiled eggs and dressed lettuce, a dish borrowed borrowed from James Beard’s “American “American Cookery.? In his way, Centeno, master of genre cooking, is trying to make a bold statement about serious American cuisine, with a forthrightness forthrightness and sense of purpose we haven’t seen since Larry Forgione opened An American Place in Manhattan Manhattan in the 1980s, and he is bold in his plainness. His chicken is inspired inspired by Beard’s approach to coq au vin, and somehow the red wine sauce with olives and a hint of orange orange reads more American than Provencal. The grilled seafood cocktail cocktail could have come out of a fine restaurant restaurant in Savannah, Oa. — the huge shrimp, touched with smoke, are especially fine.

That “herd immunity? immunity? of the vast majority proU*cts the vulner able — those too young to have been inoculated, inoculated, or people with medical conditions that make vaccination-risky, as well as the few who receive the vaccine but don’t derive immunity immunity from it. Who’s missing at the Oscars? T he Oscar nominations an nounced Thursday morning included included not a single person of color color in any of the four acting categories. categories. Of all 3ft people nomi nated for acting, writing or directing awards, only Mexican film director Ale andro Gonza lez Iharritu is non white. That’s lamentable Not because Ava DuVemay, who is black, should necessarily have been lominated for directing “Selma? (which did get nominated lor best picture) or because David Oyelowo — who played Martin lAither King in that movie — should have gotten a nod for lead actor. How the 5.76ft members of the Acade my of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominate and vote is up to them (and will always always be fodder for second-guessing, tea-leaf reading, derision and occasion dly praise.) The issue is: Why aren’t there more direc tors and actors and writers and other enter tainment industry professionals who are mi norities -- and women, for that matter — contributing to the universe of work from which academy members choose? People have been asking this question for a long time — a really long time We’ve be moaned the lack of diversity in Hollywood many times in the past Some years it looks like things are changing.

It is a terrific complement complement to the region’s more traditional entertainment entertainment industry. Holding on to and building building the region’s creative sector is the right goal. We re glad Yahoo is here. We’re glad that it merely switched neighborhoods rather than counties or states. But it’s hardly a win for the region and its economy when Los Angeles poaches a business business from Santa Monica We’ve seen that folly play out for years. Burbank and Glendale Glendale would snatch companies from L.A. and L.A. would snatch them back, with each city offering incentives and givebacks to make the local tax base look better on paper. In this case, it appears that Yahoo is moving a few blocks to take advantage of L.A.’s special special tax incentives for Internet companies. The move will put some tax dollars into L.A.’s budget that had previously gone to Santa Monica’s, but it will do nothing to enlarge enlarge or develop the economy. What is needed is an economic development development strategy that allows local cities to work together to make themselves more attractive attractive to employers ready and able to create create new Yahoo-level jobs here. Or at least to bring them here when they are outgrowing their quarters in Silicon Valley. New York or elsewhere outside the region. Neighboring cities may compete, but they should compete compete to create good jobs, not to steal them from each other. But that protection is being eroded as the anti-vaccination movement grows, laying the groundwork for ongoing and bigger outbreaks outbreaks — even though the risks associated with the vaccine are rarer than the risks associated associated with the illness. Getting vaccinated is good for the health of the inoculated person and also part of one’s public responsibility to help protect the health of others. The prospect of a new measles epidemic is disturbing. So is the knowledge that many ill-informed people accept a thoroughly discredited discredited and retracted study in the journal Lancet that purported to associate vaccination vaccination with autism, and that others mumble darkly about mercury in the inoculations. The kind of mercury that used to be in vaccines vaccines was ethylmercury. which is eliminated from the body quickly, not the truly dangerous dangerous methylmercury. In any case, the measles vaccine no longer contains it. It’s bad enough that a nasty strain of flu has now hit 46 states; our ability to fight that is limited because doctors must make an educated educated guess, many months in advance, about which flu strains will be dominant. This year, the guess didn’t work out. and flu shots have been less effective. But measles is a disease that has been beaten by modem medicine. That makes it all the more frustrating that anti-science stubbornness has proven, in the case of the Disneyland related measles, that when it comes to contagious diseases, it’s a small world after all. spawned all three nominations. And the directing directing Oscar went to the Mexican film maker Alfonso Cuaron for “Gravity.? Two years before that, actress Octavla Spencer was nominated for supporting actress and Viola Davis was nominated for lead actress. Both are African American. Spencer won. Unfortunately, those are the exceptions Yes. the academy is striving to diversity; it has invited more professionals of color to join its own overwhelmingly white ranks. (A 2012 study by The Times found that Oscar voters were nearly 94% white and 77% male.) In fact, entertainment executive Cheryl Boone Isaacs is currently the first black person to serve as president of the academy. But USC associate professor Stacy L. Smith, the director of the Media, Diversity. ? Social Change Initiative at the Annenberg School, has released several studies of minorities minorities and women in film roles, concluding that “inclusivlty and diversity are not valued by Hollywood decision makers.? Of all the direc tors of the 100 top films of 2013. only five were black. None were black women. latinos were particularly underrepresented in film; al t hough they are more than 16% of the popula tion, they accounted for only 4.9% of speak ing roles in the top grossing films of 2013 There were plenty of commendable per formances and films that got left, out this year That is always the case But it is par ticularly sad that people of color are at an Oscar Oscar disadvantage in part because they’re not working in enough films LETTERS Chrihtina House For Thr Times THE NUMBER of measles cases tied to an outbreak outbreak at Disneyland last month has climbed to 32. Measles vaccinations Re “Perfect storm for measles outbreak.” Jan. 14 In 1998, Dr. Andrew Wakefield published an article in the Lancet showing a direct relationship between the administration of the measles vaccine and autism. Eventually. British Medical Journal assessed the article and found it to be fraudulent. Wakefield lost his license, and the Lancet retracted the article. Tragically, too many misguided individuals, some with celebrity status, continue to preach the evils of vaccination based on this discredited article. Worse, they encourage other to do the same. The inevitable result is the measles epidemic we are now experiencing. We can no longer tolerate subjecting children to the risks of preventable diseases. Ignorance cannot dictate public health. No unvaccinated child should be allowed to enter public school. Parents who withhold vaccination of their children are subjecting their children and their contacts to a serious disease and should be held accountable in a court of law. Before widespread vaccination, this country had 500 deaths annually from measles. Enough. Society must protect its children from the consequences of ignorance — or should we stop mandating child restraints in cars because someone believes it causes lifelong claustrophobia? Richard Wulfsberg, MD Studio City I was disappointed that your front-page article did not mention congenital rubella syndrome in the babies of pregnant women who get measles. Perhaps this problem would get through to the parents who do not get their children vaccinated. The most famous case of this occurred before a vaccine was available when movie star Gene Tierney gave birth to a mentally disabled child after a fan with measles gave it to her. This tragedy is outlined in her autobiography. Connie Elliot Studio City Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the National Vaccination Information Center, is quoted as saying that one should “be able to make a voluntary choice without being harassed, coerced or punished.? The punishment is having one’s child die of measles encephalitis. Vaccination schedules are based on the sciences of immunology and public health. What science is the decision not to vaccinate based on? Sandra Canai.is Santa Monica The outlook for Inglewood Re “Our Inglewood moment.” moment.” Opinion. Jan. 13 I do not doubt that Erin Aubrey Kaplan cares deeply deeply for Inglewood, which is why I am so puzzled by her op-ed article It’s as if she’s making a wedding toast that questions whether the loving couple can survive the challenges of married life. Inglewood’s ascension to the ranks of most desirable desirable neighborhood in the region is predicated on more than just the renovated renovated Forum s early success success It Is a reflection of a larger urban infill movement. movement. bold new govern ment leadership, vigorous investor Interest and broad lifestyle appeal. Gentrification is a legitimate issue, but since the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, minority and other property owners are not under threat ofbecom ing unable to afford their properties. They become the first and primary beneficiaries beneficiaries of soaring property property values. Growth and development development that elevates minority communities need not result in gentrification gentrification or displacement. The answer is to incorporate incorporate educational and Job creation and local hiring programs and to fund initiatives that preserve the city’s culture and heritage. heritage. Mark F. Weinberg Agoura Hills The writer is a former Inglewood city manager What specifically does Kaplan want Inglewood and its residents to do to improve its status and image if it is assumed that they need improvement? She does Inglewood a disservice by labeling its economy as struggling while offering no specific plan to improve the economy. economy. Neither a Wal-Mart Supercenter nor gentrification gentrification of Inglewood nor a professional football sta dium may have been or would be successful in achieving what Kaplan wants. But for her to long for the past when things may have been better for Inglewood residents does nothing to improve the status quo. By the way. since the 1960s I have lived and worked adjacent to In glewood Until reading Kaplan’s article. I had never heard of Inglewood being called Inglewatts by anyone, anywhere. Marc Jacobson Los Angeles Filling their college needs Re “Free tuition isn’t free.? Editorial. Jan. 14 The Times questions the feasibility of free community community college for all. But President Obama has put his finger on a more impor tant matter: A high school diploma is no longer ade quate for a good paying Job. I^ast century, the country country coalesced around the idea that a free public high school education was necessary for the economy. Today, young people need more than a high school diploma to compete in the global labor market. Community colleges are not Just for those going on to get a four-year degree They also provide voca tional, technical and cer tiflcate training for young people and older adults who need skills beyond high school in order to land a good middle-class job Maybe free community college for all is not the answer. But education, technical training and retraining beyond a high school education is. Carl Martz Redlands Two free years of community community college. Great idea. Let’s do “free? education education right for once; Everybody Everybody pays tuition, and only those who graduate after two years in community college get u rebate of all tuition. It’s simple. Study, graduate. graduate. and then you get rewarded for accomplishing accomplishing something. There’s no “free? lunch. Robert Bubnovich Irvine We spend billions on tools of war, benefiting a few. but we eschew spending spending for human purposes, never giving consideration to a democracy’s responsibility responsibility to invest in its people people to help share economic well-being and vote with a country-nurturing insight. Must funds always be unlimited for those things that enrich defense contractors contractors or help Wall Street speculation but not for investment in the people? Jim Hoover Huntington Beach Befriending her brain cancer Re “Her brain cancer inflicts inflicts a toll, but unlocks creativity.” Column One. Jan. 14 “Friendly” (the term given by Judi Kaufman to her brain tumor), meet “My Friend,? which is what I call my HIV virus after being diagnosed last September. September. Kaufman’s optimism and creative outreach are the ingredients for positive living in the face of a lifethreatening lifethreatening illness, whether cancer or HIV. I admire her courage and her decision to not let her cancer become the enemy but to befriend it instead, just as I have chosen to do with my HIV, which is now a friend for life. I just wish there had been enough time for my father to name his Stage 4 glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor before he passed away four months after his diagnosis in 2006.1 am sure he would have come up with one heck of a name. Gregory Valenica Whittier Kaufman?s story resonates resonates deeply as a strategy for managing many of life’s intractable difficulties. As a family therapist in pri vate practice, I see so much suffering that comes from how we view the challenges before us, not by the simple reality of the challenge. By reframing her cancer tumor as “Friendly.” Kaufman Kaufman opened a path to creativity and to serving others that she might not otherwise have ever experienced. experienced. By befriending our real-life difficulties, we affirm life at its very core. Kane Phelps Pacific Palisades HOW TO WRITE TO US Please send letters to letters?a latimes.com.

The new production is less a traditional revival and more a reimagination by Culture Clash who, as in the original, perform most of the four dozen or so characters. While the narrative is the same — Dodger pitcher Fernando Fernando Valenzuela is visited on the field by the ghosts of Chavez Ravine’s past — the new incarnation is infused with multimedia. Historical video and photo projections have been culled from photo essayist Don Normark’s “Chavez Ravine, 1949: A Los Angeles Story,” as well as the Getty Research Institute and the digital archives of UCLA and USC, among other places.

Public and private officials officials have mounted a 10-year plan called Bringing Back Broadway Intended to reopen reopen its historic theaters and put more than 1 million square feet of vacant commercial commercial space back into use. Much of the development so far has clustered between 7th Street and Olympic and to the west, where thousands thousands of apartments are under construction and one residential complex nearby will include a Whole Foods grocery store. “The south part of Broadway is really going to lead.” said Cohen of RKF, “and Tribune may be another another bookend on the north.” Tribune Co. owns the former former Times Mirror Square complex on 1st Street between between Broadway and Spring Street where The Times is a tenant. Tribune said last month that it is seeking partners to help develop the site that is now about half vacant. The old May Co. building will apparently set the bar high for reuse of historic structures. The Beaux-Artsstyle Beaux-Artsstyle building opened in 1908 as the Hamburger department department store, and in addition to selling clothing and home furnishings, it had an 80foot-long 80foot-long soda fountain, a restaurant, a grocery store, a post office and a roof garden.

The department store grew even bigger after its 1923 purchase by May Co., a St. Louis department store chain that went on to build many Southland locations.

State takes aim at tightening vaccine waiver [Waiver, from Al] Currently, 13,592 California California kindergarten students have waivers due to their parents’ personal beliefs; 2,764 of those were based on religious beliefs, state health statistics show. “There are not enough people being vaccinated to contain these dangerous diseases,? said state Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento). (D-Sacramento). a pediatrician and one of the bill’s authors. “We should not wait for more children to sicken or die before before we act.” State Sen. Ben Allen (DSanta (DSanta Monica), a co-author, said his district included pockets where many parents parents have elected not to immunize immunize their children. He said his father had polio. Matthew B. McReynolds of the Pacific Justice Institute, Institute, a conservative Sacramento-based Sacramento-based organization that advocates for parental rights and religious freedoms, freedoms, said removing the exemptions exemptions would be an overreaction overreaction and a dismissal of legitimate concerns about vaccines by some parents. “It’s concerning to me that the measles outbreak seems to have prompted some hysteria,” he said, “and this seems like a pretty sweeping approach to what really is a very limited problem problem that could be addressed in other ways.” In 2012, Brown signed legislation legislation that restricted personal-belief personal-belief exemptions by requiring that parents be counseled by healthcare providers on the risks of not being vaccinated. The governor’s office says that since the bill took effect, those exemptions have decreased decreased by nearly 20%, from 315% of children in the 201314 201314 school year to 2.54% in 2014-15. Brown was criticized by some health experts, however. however. for exempting parents with religious objections from meeting with a medical professional. On Wednesday. Brown’s representatives would not directly address whether the religious exemption should be repealed or maintained, but they noted that those are claimed by only about 0.5% of kindergarten students. students. Pan said he was open to discussion on the issue as the legislation proceeds. Although all 50 states require require vaccinations for children children starting school, only about 20 states allow waivers waivers based on personal beliefs. beliefs. Almost all states grant religious exemptions, except except for two: Mississippi and West Virginia. Mississippi has the nation’s nation’s highest measles immunization immunization rate for kindergarten kindergarten students, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Disease Control and Prevention; Prevention; 99.7% for the 2013-14 kindergarten kindergarten class. West Virginia’s rate was also high — 96.1%, above the national median of 94.7%. California’s rate that year was 92.3%. California has long been criticized by health experts for making exemptions easy, which allowed too many children children into preschool and kindergarten kindergarten without vaccines. For many years, the percentage percentage of kindergarten students students with vaccine exemptions exemptions on file due to a parent’s beliefs was small — less than 1% from the fall of 1978 to the fall of2000. But the rate has risen steadily alongside the antivaccine antivaccine movement, reaching a high of 3.15% in the fall of 2013 before dipping to 2.54% last fall.

Five years later, the former drug den houses the evangelical Union Church of Glory. James, 31, and members of his extended family, all former street gang members, members, have launched guided strolls through the historic seafront enclave for visiting tourists who seem to be flocking to the quaint and increasingly trendy area, a mishmash of fabulously restored 19th century buildings, buildings, wooden clapboard houses and crowded, woebegone woebegone tenements. It looks a lot like parts of New Orleans, Orleans, or maybe Havana in its better days. Backing the former gangsters are a developer, evangelical preachers and business groups betting their own future prosperity on a plan to replace gang violence with economic opportunity. Not so long ago, James and other members of his Ciudad de Dios gang (named after the notorious Brazilian version) were squatting in the old American American Trade building, a holdover holdover from the days of U.S. control of the Panama Canal. Canal. They sold drugs in the abandoned and dilapidated structure and prowled the streets to attack and rob tourists, by James’ own admission. Enter K.C. Hardin, who bought the American Trade and embarked on a mission, now successful, to make it one of the most prestigious, and most expensive, hotels in Panama City. That meant dealing with the gangs. Instead of evicting gang members or demanding they be jailed, Hardin said, he and other community leaders decided to include them, providing jobs and helping them start small businesses. That was coupled coupled with a concerted effort to restore and upgrade many of the Casco Viejo’s neoclassical and Art Deco buildings. “A rising tide has lifted their boats as well,” Hardin. 41, a former corporate banker banker from New York, said of the gangsters. “The neighborhood neighborhood has totally changed.” Parts of the Casco Viejo went from being dangerous to virtually crime-free. ?Used to be we only robbed the tourists.

Arnulfo Franco Associated Press WORSHIPERS WALK in a procession in Panama City’s seafront Casco Viejo district. The gentrifying neighborhood has been attracting more tourists. Tracy Wilkinson i LUIS “RICKY” JAMES, a former gang member, now leads walking tours through the district. “Ricky” James, who is Antonio’s Antonio’s cousin and another gangster turned tour guide. Others have started a jazz club; still others a small restaurant-bar in a narrow alleyway. No one says this is a surefire solution that can be applied far more broadly. Panama is said to still have about 200 gangs, and the Casco Viejo project is but a drop in the bucket. Still, the gangs in Panama Panama have not reached the same levels of lethal viciousness viciousness as seen in other Central American countries such as El Salvador and Honduras. And if just a handful choose employment opportunities over a life of violence and crime, that?s a positive development, several residents residents and law enforcement experts said. Until recently, Panama?s approach to gangs, like that of many countries in the region, was heavy on police action and incarceration. Last year, the government announced a $35-million “safe neighborhoods” program program nationwide aimed at bringing back gang members members to law-abiding society. But the effort is still in its incipient stage. “My life is changed, thank God,” Antonio James said as he guided two journalists journalists through the Casco Viejo streets. After several stints in jail, James had three children and then met Hardin, who encouraged him to take classes for selfesteem selfesteem and skills. James left the gang formally in 2013 after nearly 15 years. He and the other former members now call their group Fortaleza, or Strength. By mid-April, Fortaleza had taken about 500 visitors on tours this year, each paying about $25. The tour started at an 1890 wooden building that serves as governmentsubsidized governmentsubsidized housing and where Victoria Griego, 93, tottered out of her bed to greet passersby. James has two sisters. He is now doing well enough that he can pay for their schooling; they plan to graduate from college, the first in his family to do so. The tour goes past tenement tenement buildings where children children in underwear play in the streets while adults sit on crumbling stoops. James’ mother waves out the window from a thirdfloor thirdfloor flat. “She is very proud of what I’m doing now,” he said. Children run up to him and give him a hug. “Tio!” they say, using the Spanish word for uncle. Other highlights include a spectacular Masonic Lodge, an elementary school called Estados Unidos Unidos (United States) and a hip music bar, outside of which two young boys were shooting pigeons for upcoming upcoming lunch.

VINNY’S — with its counter dining and open kitchen — is the latest from Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo of Animal, Son of a Gun, Trois Mec and Petit Trois. COUNTER INTELLIGENCE A very haute local pizza joint JONATHAN GOLD RESTAURANT CRITIC The best vantage of Jon ? Vinny’s, Vinny’s, the new pizzeria across the street from Canter’s Delicatessen, may be from Helen’s, the tiny, glassed-in wine shop behind the dining room. Helen’s is superbly air-conditioned, even on a miserable miserable summer day, and the restaurant’s restaurant’s groaning hip-hop sounds almost almost elegant back here. The wines are surprising — a lot of the fashionable fashionable natural stuff, sure, but also rare, nicely aged bottles of Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape and Chablis. From the well-chilled refuge, you can imagine sugar-snap peas blackened on the grill; a salad of transparently thin sliced summer squash seasoned with lemon and toasted hazelnuts; and meltlngly soft slabs of eggplant Parmesan that seem to have been made with no oil at all. You imagine angelic bruschetta smeared with rlcotta and honey, or a Little Gem lettuce salad with wisps of shaved cheese, or creamy burrata with luscious white peach. If you were so inclined, inclined, you could almost fool yourself yourself into thinking you were at an elegant elegant vegetarian restaurant. And then you step back into the restaurant, toward the roar of conversation, conversation, the music, the garlic, the grilled cutlets, the wall of flames. Have you remembered to reserve? Good — you’ll be seated, maybe soon. If not, you will join the hungry masses waiting outside for a shot at the pizza, the agnolotti with brown butter and sage, and the fist-sized meatballs with ricotta. There are only 45 seats here. I wouldn’t count on a table soon. Jon ? Vinny’s is the latest project project from Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo, Dotolo, who are also behind Animal. Son of a Gun, Trois Mec and Petit Trois.

Vinny’s on Fairfax Avenue, the new red-sauce Italian restaurant from the chefs behind Animal and Son of a Gun, is about the size of a walk-in closet. And yet the 6-by-8-foot space holds a whole world of wine. Open the door and it’s like walking into someone’s private cellar, albeit with prices and comments on the bottles and a faded kilim rug on the floor.

She says it has forced her to focus and tightly curate the selections. selections. And, of course, the list changes all the time. Diners do come in and pick up a bottle to have in the restaurant, but most guests order off the wine list. Sometimes she parks people waiting for a table inside the shop. “It’s great for parties of eight,? says Johannesen. “I bring them wine, and they dance to the hip-hop we play at night.? It’s also one way to keep warm in the chilly 58-degree space. The shop itself is Just phase one. In a couple of weeks. Johannesen neither pale like a California pie nor freckled like the Neapolitan model—it is charred and smoking, thin and almost too crisp to fold, almost destroyed by the intense wood heat.

This is probably the part where I should tell you that no matter how tempting the warm strawberry strawberry bread pudding or the chocolate chocolate budino with sea salt may sound, what you’re really going to want is the soft-serve ice cream, swirled chocolate and strawberry erupting from a tiny paper cup. If you want to pretend that you are capping an evening out at Federici’s Federici’s or L?B Spumoni Gardens, that is the obvious way to go. But if plums are in season, you should also probably get the bruteed Santa Rosas with opal basil, fennel and a drizzle of verjus, nestled into a bowl of mascarpone.

You have been here before. Until you remember to look at the food on your plate — pink curls of smoked trout with roasted beets and little heaps of salmon roe perhaps, perhaps, or bits of onion puffed into vegetable chicharrones served like chips with a kind of sorrel-soured guacamole — it is easy to forget that you are in Ari Taymor’s domain, a reincarnation of a rarefied restaurant restaurant best-known for its shriveled but delicious butter-roasted carrots and its ethereal seaweed-tofu beignets. beignets. Alma’s closing in October was one of the biggest restaurant stories of 2015, and the way you reacted to it may have said more about you than it did about the actual circumstances circumstances of its demise. Some people thought it was a symptom of the toxic gentrification of downtown; some that Alma was too pure for its own good; some that Los Angeles was too shallow to support even modestly avant-garde cooking. Alma had been honored about as much as a young restaurant can be — The Times ranked it 12th in its list of the 101 best Los Angeles restaurants, restaurants, and Bon Appetit named it the best new U.S. restaurant of 2013. Taymor was chosen as a Best New Chef by Food and Wine, and as a Rising Star Chef finalist by the James Beard Foundation. Some observers. observers. including Taymor himself, thought that the praise may have set up unreasonable expectations in the minds of its customers, many of whom were international travelers travelers expecting the polish and conceptual conceptual unity of superstars like El Celler de Can Roca or Eleven Madison Madison Park. Even Alma’s best friends acknowledged that the multicourse tasting menus, often reliant on the nuanced subtleties of roots, foraged plants and seeds, could occasionally occasionally be a slog. Still, if the last several years have taught us anything in Los Angeles, it is that a restaurant may exist as a concept as well as a physical space; that it is possible for an underground underground party in somebody?s backyard backyard to shape-shift into a supper club, a funky Chinese joint and finally finally a video arcade; a taco truck can morph into a world-class dining room; and an haute cuisine menu can shuttle between a wine bar and a friend’s borrowed living room. Restaurants as well as people can thrive in a gig economy. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that Alma appears to be not just a popup popup but a frill-fledged restaurant in the Standard space — seven nights a week until at least the end of February February and probably the end of May. (The kitchen crew and the service staff is mostly intact.)

And then there’s the most unlikely great ceviche in town — the fragrant, citrusy Peruvian ceviche from Lonzo’s in Culver City, a ceviche made more remarkable by the fact that it is served at one of a couple of tables crammed into a bakery foyer. So you’re going to have some hot rolls with a dab of the chile sauce aji ; you are going to contemplate an order of the lomo saltado: and you may end up with a plate of the cilantro-laced cilantro-laced lamb stew.

Ciudad Juarez has managed managed to turn the story around over the last two years through a combination combination of developments, including including the apparent victory of one drug gang over its rivals, rivals, a drawdown of federal police and troops, and new social programs launched by private business. When Mexican President Enrique Pefia Nieto visited the city last month, he announced announced the decline in homicides. Last year, Juarez had the lowest number since the surge in drug violence eight years earlier: 311, compared compared with 3,111 when the violence violence peaked in 2010.

In recent years, the mass killings abated, and the epicenter epicenter of border violence shifted east to Tamaulipas state.

The attacks on Saturday and Sunday mornings caused an estimated $LI million million in damage and left behind behind the smoldering remains remains of 48 Mercedes, BMWs and Porsches. Some of the masked attackers smashed the windows of the cars; others threw plastic container with flammable materials through the broken broken windows. “We’re not going to let this left-wing mob take over our streets,” said Berlin Interior Interior Minister Frank Henkel, who vowed the city would do everything in its power to stop the “street terror” terror” before the arsonists struck again. “The horriiyIng horriiyIng images show that these left-wing anarchists are bent on destruction and have no respect for private property.” property.” There have been isolated cases of expensive cars being being set on fire in Berlin, a city with a thriving counterculture counterculture where rents were once extremely low. They have been rising steadily in recent years, and the attacks on cars — about 250 are set on fire each year — are seen as political statements against gentrification. A peak was reached in 2011, when more than 400 luxury luxury cars were set on fire. But never before had there been such a coordinated and massive massive attack as during the weekend. This weekend’s attacks came in areas where rents have soared and property prices have skyrocketed more them fivefold in recent years to as much as $615 per square foot. Many squatters live in areas near the attacks. Last month, 500 police raided one of the largest buildings occupied by squatters squatters after some of the residents residents had attacked and injured injured riot police. The illegal occupants are still there. A left-wing group calling itself the Social Democratic People?s Bicycle Commando claimed responsibility for the arson attacks. “We wanted to remove the windows windows from the luxury cars and scrap them the warm way,? the group said in its statement. Many left-wingers in Berlin, Berlin, where squatting has been a long and vibrant tradition, tradition, believe that they are entitled to defend their way of living and that burning the cars will scare away yuppies yuppies and wealthy investors.

219,1959314966,"OPINION EDITORIALS Retry Richard Alarcon The councilman is accused of violating the public trust, and the D.A. is right to seek a second trial. F or former Ix)s Angeles City Councilman Councilman Ricliard Alarcon, the reversals reversals of fortune just keep on coming. He served as a councilman, state senator and assemblyman before being convicted in 2014 of lying to voters about where he lived when he ran for Ids council seat. He spent 51 days under house arrest and was barred from ever holding holding public office again. But then, in January, the state’s 2nd District Court of Appeal threw out the convictions, saying the trial judge liad given an improper instruction to the jury. Two months later. Alarcon announced announced he would run for Congress, cliallenging cliallenging incumbent U S. Rep Tony Cardenas. Cardenas. Then, last week. Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey announced she would retry Alarcon on the same four cliarges the appellate court overturned. Lacey’s decision was not universally praised. Alarcon’s allies insist tliat the continued continued prosecution is a waste of time and taxpayer money. His attorney plans to file a motion asking the court, to dismiss the case, and notes that the jury dismissed 12 of the original 16 charges. Legal analysts liave suggested suggested tliat the appellate decision will make the charges even more difficult to prove. And CAMPAIGN 2016 3 worthy judicial incumbents Challengers to Kaddo, Santana and Solorzano fail to make the case that they would do a better job. H ow is a voter to separate the good judicial candidates from the bad ones? Rarely are there candidate forums, so there are few chances to make comparisons or ask questions. questions. There is little news report ing about judges or judicial races, so reliable and evenhanded evenhanded information is scarce. Tlie Times editorial page does its best to help voters make their decisions by interviewing interviewing each candidate for I/is Angeles Superior Superior Court, talking with lawyers who liave worked with and against them in court, weighing their knowledge, competence, integrity. integrity. temperament and demeanor, and recommending the candidate we believe to be the best of those running for each seat. We divide our endorsements in the six judicial judicial races on the 2016 ballot in two. and focus focus here on the three seats in which lawyers have challenged judges who already liave been sitting and serving. A challenger should have a good reason for seeking to oust an incumbent judge. California’s California’s hybrid judicial selection system, in which the governor appoints most trial judges but the people can remove them in elections, strikes a delicate balance between judicial independence and public accountability. accountability. Worrying about potential cliallenges could easily make judges handle their rulings rulings differently by focusing on possible voter reaction rather than the merits of the case. About 150 Los Angeles Superior Court judges are approaching the end of their terms and are up for reelection, but most were not challenged for reelection and will automatically get another six-year term. Their names won’t even appear on the ballot. ballot. James Kaddo. Ray Santana and Kathryn Kathryn Ann Solorzano were not so lucky Each drew a single challenger. Our recommendations: Office 60: James Kaddo This is one of those judicial races in which the cliallenger’s explanations for running, and for targeting a particular judge, are almost almost funny or would be. if they didn?t force Kaddo. a capable judge for more than 25 years, to raise money and campaign in order order to continue serving Los Angeles It?s not as though cliallenger Stepan W Baghdassarian is qualified to replace liim. Baghdassarian wasn?t even an active member member of tlie State Bar of California until late last year, having given up his law practice long ago to run a wine importing business. Now he wants to be a judge Why cliallenge Kaddo? Nothing personal, he Insists. It?s just that he?s an immigrant from lebanon and wants to repay liis adopted nation for the opportunity it lias given him. That/s nice, but it doesn’t explain why out of the 150 other judges he could liave challenged, or any of the three vacant seats he could have sought, he decided instead to Cos Anodes (Times FOUNDEDDECEMBER 4 IHHI Davan Maiiahaj Mamc Duvoihin.

Even with those cliallenges, Lacey is right to pursue justice. Alarcon was cliarged with a serious violation of public trust. There are few requirements placed on candidates candidates running for local office in California, but one of them is that tliey must live in tlie districts tliey seek to represent. Alarcon is accused of listing as liis address on voter registration and candidate filing documents a run-down house in Panorama City in the 7th Council District. Prosecutors say he actually actually lived in his wife?s new. larger Sun Valley Valley house, outside the district. Alarcon has said tliat lie was staying at tlie Sun Valley home only temporarily wliile renovating the other property. Prosecutors presented witness witness testimony tliat Alarcon bragged tliat he was elected to his council seat without living living in the district and then once in office, he was gone for so long from the Panorama City house tliat a squatter moved in and changed all the locks. Tlie D.A.?s office is one of the few in the state willing to investigate and file cliarges against elected officials for lying about living in their districts. And it is absolutely right to do so. No politician should be allowed to play fast and loose with the rules. Lacey should get credit for keeping up the fight, and for sending a message tliat fraud will not be tolerated. tolerated. run against L A’s only judge who also just liappens to be an immigrant from lebanon. Either there is a story here that neither candidate candidate is telling us. or Baghdassarian has an odd sense of humor. As an alternative explanation. Baghdassarian Baghdassarian notes tliat he lives in the Valley, and Kaddo sits in Van Nuys, so it makes sense for liirn to seek tliat seat rather than one in Lancaster. Lancaster. Pomona or somewhere else. Nice try. but judicial offices arc not tied to a particular particular courthouse. and any judge elected to tliis seat could be assigned to sit anywhere in tlie county. Baghdassarian lias no business being being a judge in Van Nuys. Pomona or anywhere anywhere else in Los Angeles County. Office 120: Ray Santana Judge Ray Santana was appointed to the bench in 2008 and was reelected without opposition opposition to a full term in 2010. In recent months, though, illness lias kept liim from his duties. That may be one reason why private private practitioner Eric O. Ibisi filed to run against him. Or not. Ibisi has run a stealth campaiga or rather, no campaign at all declining to make liis case as to why he Ls qualified to be a judge, wliy Santana ought to be removed or why he believes he would do a better job. It is left to voters to ferret out tliat his practice includes criminal defense, tliat liis office is near Mac Arthur Park and that he is a graduate graduate of Pepperdine University Law School Santana is a fonner deputy public defender defender who earned liis law degree from UC Berkeley Wliile he was presiding, he was a well-regarded judge. He told Tlie Times tliat lie intends to resume liis duties in June. Concern about liis ability to serve might give voters some pause when deciding whether to reelect him - or it would, if there were a capable cliallenger ready to take his place. Ibisi offers nothing to suggest that he is that capable challenger. Office 165: Kathryn Solorzano Some courtrooms can be described as lax. with conversations going on about tlie room and judges waiting patiently on the bench for lawyers who are late for their scheduled liearings. Kathryn Solorzano?s criminal courtroom at the Airport Courthouse Courthouse on la Cienega Boulevard is not one of those. Lawyers who arrive late, perliaps because because they were complet ing a hearing in another another courtroom, will hear about it. Deputy Public Defender Tami L. Warren was one such lawyer. Now she has cliallenged cliallenged Solorzano. But wliile Warren has some impressive credentials, she lias failed to make either the case that she would be a better judge than Solorzano or that Solorzano Solorzano ought to be removed Solorzano was a well-regarded I os Angeles Angeles deputy district attorney for 17 years and lias served ably on the bench forthe last decade. decade. It would be a mistake for voters to oust her merely because she runs a tight ship. In addition to these races, there are three open judicial seats, in which candidates arc vying for positions soon to be vacated. The Times will publish its endorsement in those races later this week.

I lived outside Southern California during the 1980s and most oftlie 90s. so I never experienced the excitement the Latin American population brought to the area. This place has indeed experienced experienced a variety of upturns and downturns, but it is important to always remember remember tliat if things are not changing, tliey run the risk of stagnation and extinction.

Simple The people are angry and want, change Only Democratic presidential presidential candidate Sen. Bemie Sanders and Trump offer cliange. Since the Democrats liave rigged the system to nominate non-cliange agent Hillary Clinton, they are prepared to go forthe possibly disastrous disastrous Trump. Larry Severson Fountain Valley This needs to be said. It’s the 10.000-pound gorilla in the room. The people who support support Trump are being hoodwinked, bamboozled, grifted. whatever you want to call it — they are being conned. Tliey are falling for a pitcliman?s hustle who is blaming all of their woes on ?others.? whether it be Mexican rapists or Muslim terrorists. All of tlieir life problems are the fault of others, and only Trump can fix it. Tliat is what they ’re being sold. and they’re buying it hook, line and sinker. Rather than take stock of their lives and rise up from their misery, they just want to blame someone else for their misfortune. Tliey are ripe for picking, and Trump is liarvesting them like nobody ’s business. business. Scott W. Hughes West, lake Village Don’t simplify Shakespeare Re ?Perchance to understand.? understand.?

We. as a modem audience, have become lazy and no longer wish to participate aesthetically in experiencing live dramatic art You dishonor Shakespeare Shakespeare when you “translate? “translate? liim Can English actually be translated into English? The joy of teaching and performing Shakespeare lies in the excavation of the original text how to suit the action to the word, the word to the action. Shakespeare Shakespeare leaves us invaluable clues inside the text., in the actual sounds of the words, that help to illuminate not only the understanding of the words but. how the words should be delivered Once the actor understands understands wliat is being said, the audience will too. Mark O’Connor should concentrate his effort s to educate actors and directors directors on tlie “ magic of the text ? By tampering with genius, you rob an audience audience (and the actor) of the ftill experience of Shakespeare Shakespeare You will leave something mundane and cliche behind by removing tlie magic. Timothy Landkield Los Angeles T’lie writer is a core faculty member at Tlie American Academy of Dramatic Arts. 0 ?Connor writes, “Sliakespeare fans may wonder: Wliat would liis plays sound like in modem English translation?? Sliakespeare’s language technically is considered Modem English, which first emerged in the 14th century, although a number number of liis words might have different meanings today or liave been forgotten. We don?t distinguish a writer by the story, we make a distinction by liis writing, his style and technique. technique. By simplifying Sliakespeare?s language, we effectively lose the imprint of liis style and liis unique vocabulary. It can be mentally painful painful to try to understand abstruse writing: it involves involves cogitation and thoughtful visualization, which seem to be unfamiliar unfamiliar practices in the world of technology and the desultory desultory thinking development development of today’s younger generation.

The two contenders who emerged from a field of 20 during during the primary are both experienced public servants committed to improving the quality quality of life in the often forgotten northeast comer of Los Angeles. Either candidate. Monica Rodriguez or Karo Torossian. would be a good representative representative on the City Council. They couldn?t be any worse tlian the incumbent — there isn’t one! Former Councilman Felipe Puentes Puentes quit the job a year before iiis term ended to become a lobbyist in Sacramento; the district district has been represented by a caretaker councilman since September. Even before fr?uentes. residents of Council Council District 7, which includes the communities communities of Sylmar. Mission Hills, Pacoima. Lakeview Lakeview Terrace. Sunland-Tujunga and Shadow Shadow Hills, have suffered from inconsistent leadership due to redistricting and rapid councilmember turnover. That’s one reason district residents iiave been frustrated with City Hall. Too many communities lack basic infrastructure, such as sidewalks and street lights, and they haven’t seen the same level of economic investment as neighboring districts districts or the city as a whole. This is a district that needs a committed representative in City Hall who lias a track record of getting tilings done Between two st rong candidates.

BrayAli. Harsh campaign mailers are landing in mailboxes, racist conunents Iiave been made, supporters can be found screaming at each other at events, and accusations of unethical behavior have been leveled. It’s in stark contrast to the relatively mild race that led to the March primary election, in which the biggest drama that occurred was when someone was caught on video tearing down a Bray-Ali campaign sign. Though council members almost always win outright in the primary by attracting more than 50% of the vote. Cedillo has found himself in a runoff against an opponent, with a fraction of his campaign cash, political support or name recognition. That’s because because District 1. which stretches from upscale upscale parts of Highland Park to the dense, low-income neighborhoods around MacArthur MacArthur Park, is in need of a responsive, respectful respectful steward as it experiences transformative transformative growth. The council member must balance the needs of the district ’s constituents with the formidable pressure from developers to build more housing.

That means the dwelling Is substandard, or that families are doubled up, or that they spend more than half their Income on housing. Then, of course, we’ve got 58,000 homeless people. When I wrote about the Intersection of high rent and homelessness two weeks ago, I referred to a mother and son living In their car. I then heard from a woman who said she could Identify. She lives In her car and parks It at a hospital, where she gets dialysis treatments three times a week. “I was middle class up until very recently,” said the woman, In her 50s, whose name I’m withholding because because she doesn’t want the hospital to know she lives in the parking lot. I paid her avlslt. She said her work as a legal secretary dried up after she got sick, so she moved In with a friend who later died. The landlord raised the rent, and she moved Into her car, with no family to call on and a disability check as her only Income. She’s on a waiting list for a kidney transplant, and her hope Is that she’ll one day get a new kidney, go back to work, and be able to afford an apartment again. As It Is, the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment Is $1,995, and she can’t come close to that. When I last wrote on this topic, I heard from people who claimed they had all the answers. But for every proposed proposed solution, there’s a counter-argument and a reality too complicated for easy fixes. Los Angeles alone can’t solve a regional or national housing crisis, said professor professor Jerry Nlckelsburg of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, nor can It stem the tide of people who want to live here. “People moving Into California are better-educated better-educated and have higher Incomes Incomes than those who are moving out,” he said, and that’s having a direct effect on rising rents. Calls for rent control are met with cries that such controls are unfair to landlords landlords and drive up costs for other renters. Developers argue that eliminating red tape and simplifying environmental requirements would speed construction, and prices would drop as supply Increases. Increases. Critics counter that new luxury units will far outnumber less-expensive apartments. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcettl Is pushing a plan for a linkage fee on new construction, requiring developers to kick Into a fund for affordable housing. He claims that the Idea — In use now In San Diego, San Francisco and Oakland — would raise $100 million a year and be leveraged to create $400 million In housing housing annually. But the development development community Is apoplectic, apoplectic, saying the proposal would slow construction and lead to higher prices. A committee of the City Genaro Molina Los Angeles Times A WOMAN joins other Boyle Heights activists protesting protesting the gentrification of their neighborhood. Council—a body that’s beholden, some argue, to the money and clout of the real estate Industry—has delayed action. Garcettl told me he’s confident the measure will pass. “The devil Is going to be In the details,” he said. Garcettl has a lot on the line, because the fee Is a central piece of his plan to address the housing crisis. Another key Is completion of a general plan that would allow greater housing density density In areas where It makes sense, such as near transit corridors. Peter Dreler, a professor at Occidental College, helped design a linkage fee forthe city of Boston, when he worked there many years ago. “Everyone In Boston said It would kill the golden goose of prosperity, but we Ignored them,” said Dreler, and Boston continued to prosper. Dreler said Los Angeles needs to build more affordable affordable housing, but also has to preserve what’s left of a dwindling number of affordToday affordToday in North America Storms move east: Severe thunderstorms capable of producing heavy rain, hall and damaging winds will develop from western New York to Arkansas.

They’re being lost partly because when tenants move out of units built prior to 1978, the landlord landlord can raise rents to any level. A bill that would give cities more power to cap rent Increases has Garcettl’s support, but It’s been stalled In Sacramento under heavy pressure from landlords. In some cases, landlords have a legitimate beef. I visited Loretta and Henry Sellnger, who own seven midsize apartment buildings buildings In the Mar Vista area, with a total of 97 units. Some of their longtime tenants are paying as little as $900 a month, despite healthy Incomes, forunits that could rent for twice that much. The Selingers can’t raise the rent more than 3% to 5% a year, even when they Invest thousands for building Improvement s and seismic safety upgrades. upgrades. “We’re not crying poverty,” poverty,” said Loretta, but the Selingers think It’s unfair to require them to charge far less than they could get In a free market. So what to do? In Florida’s book, which Garcettl recommended to me, the fixes Include some of what Los Angeles has done or Is doing. Build more transit, which creates more jobs and connects more people to paychecks and housing. Build denser housing housing near transportation hubs. Build more affordable rental housing, as the linkage linkage fee would make possible. possible. And address the other end of the challenge — flat or declining wages in the service Industry—by Increasing Increasing the minimum wage for people whose work supports supports the robust economy that draws so many people to L.A. Florida also calls for eliminating restrictive zoning and building codes to make way for higherdensity higherdensity projects. He recommends recommends taking billions In federal subsidies for mortgage mortgage deductions that go to some of the wealthiest people In the country, and kicking It Into housing or housing assistance. Why not tax property on Its usefulness, usefulness, argues Florida, with lower taxe son property that serves a great public need such as affordable housing? And why aren’t tech giants, at the center of the new economy of winners and losers, doing more to support support their own service employees employees or joining the search for broader fixes? Donald Trump said he was going to rebuild cities, but his budget proposals seem to have a different objective In mind and would cost cities millions In housing housing funds. All the more reason for cities to figure out what they can do on their own, or In conjunction with officials from other cities and the state. If the L.A. City Council doesn’t want to support a linkage fee, fine. But In that case, It damn well better come up with something else. steve.lopez@latlmes.com",6/18/2017,"('protesting', 'protesting', 'the')","('their', 'neighborhood', 'council')",[' A committee of the City Genaro Molina Los Angeles Times A WOMAN joins other Boyle Heights activists protesting protesting the gentrification of their neighborhood.'], A committee of the City Genaro Molina Los Angeles Times A WOMAN joins other Boyle Heights activists protesting protesting the gentrification of their neighborhood

Their records feature the uniquely charming charming sound Girlpool has crafted over the last few years: equal parts radical and sentimental, loud and quiet — or, in their words, ?intentionally warm and soft.?

1374,2070268312,"Housing crisis spans a wide income range [Hiltzik, from Cl] one broad brush, it rezones the urban state of California based on where a bus line runs,” says former Los Angeles City Councilman and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who is currently currently director of the Los Angeles Initiative at UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs. There are many reasons for California’s failure to keep up with housing demand. demand. One is the “incumbency “incumbency effect” — existing residents are hostile to changes that might increase traffic, attract residents of lower income and different ethnicities, or produce other changes that could lower their property values. Existing residents who vote plainly have more clout with their elected officials than nonresidents waiting for a chance to move in. Whatever the reasons for California’s housing shortage, shortage, the harvest is now coming in. The state will need anywhere from 1.8 million to 3.5 million new homes by 2025 to absorb existing demand and future population growth. But its current construction pace of fewer than 80,000 new homes per year falls short by 100,000 homes a year of meeting even the lowest estimate of demand. And much of the construction construction is taking place inland, far from the coastal areas hosting most of the job growth. That combination combination increases urban sprawl, and only substitutes transportation transportation costs for housing costs. In Stanislaus County, parts of which are bedroom communities for the San Francisco Bay Area, average average annual housing costs are about $17,280, compared with the San Francisco average of $25,056, the state assessment says. But transportation transportation costs for San Francisco residents average only $8,919, while those in Stanislaus average $13,519. It’s still cheaper to live near Modesto and commute, but the gap is narrow — not counting the time lost on the road. “As affordability beCool beCool power tie boss. have control over the types of materials you chose to edit, and once you get some experience under your belt you can specialize and focus in a topic or area of your choosing.

Above, people sleep at the Civic Center/Grand Park Metro station in L.A. comes more problematic, people ‘overpay’ for housing, housing, ‘over-commute’ by driving long distances between between home and work, and ‘overcrowd’ by sharing space to the point that quality of life is severely impacted,” warned the California Department of Housing and Community Development in its most recent housing assessment, issued in February. The crisis threatens to cut the state’s economic boom off at the knees. The housing shortage costs California $140 billion a year — the equivalent of 6% of gross state product — according according to a 2016 calculation by McKinsey & Co. That doesn’t include business opportunities or expansions forgone or relocations instituted instituted by employers because they can’t recruit or keep workers in the state’s highcost highcost housing environment. The most visible sign of the crisis is homelessness. One single sampled night in January 2015, California had nearly 116,000 homeless people — 21% of the national total, despite having only 12% of the U.S. population. Indeed, the deepest shortfall in housing is for families earning 50% of the regional median income or less, for whom 1.5 million more units are needed. (The applicable median income for a family of four in Los Angeles County is $64,800, and in San Francisco County $il5,300.) But the shortages are creeping ever higher on the income scale. In 2016, according to the 2018 housing assessment of the California Department of Housing and Community Development, the state faced a shortfall of more than a million units for households earning between between 50% and 120% of the median wage; only for households earning 120% of the median or more was there even a modest surplus. surplus. Subsidies and voucher programs exist to help low-income families spending spending more than 30% of their income on housing. But those programs are oversubscribed, oversubscribed, and unlikely ever to be fully funded; providing housing assistance assistance to all low-income Californians Californians who don’t get it now would cost tens of billions of dollars, according to the state legislative analyst, making it the largest largest state expenditure outside outside of education. The Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown took major steps last year to address the crisis, enacting a package package of 15 bills that streamlined streamlined the permitting and environmental review process process for new housing, gave developers more incentives for projects that include units for low-income residents, residents, and took some authority authority away from local communities that hadn’t met housing demand yet still were blocking new developments. Some of these measures already seem to have home fruit. A development firm Advertising Supplement Boss stealing your ideas? O ne of the most challenging professional situations to have to deal with is a scheming and self-serving boss who is constantly stealing your ideas or taking credit for your work, leaving you in the dust with nothing to show for your efforts and accomplishments. Hopefully tills doesn’t sound familiar or hit too close to home for you — but if it does, we know how difficult it can be. The last thing any of us want to do is put ourselves into an adversarial situation with our bosses, so there’s a real impulse not to say or do anything about it — which can quietly “signal” your boss that you’re okay with their bad behavior or at the very least not going to rock the boat for them, which means the theft may continue (or get worse). It’s important to do something when your boss is stealing your ideas. But how can you handle the situation delicately enough so that you don’t make things unbearable for yourself, yet firmly and decisively enough to send a clear message that you’re not willing to put up with this? If you or someone you know is struggling with this reality, there is hope, and a way forward. Entrepreneur published an article that highlights strategies for dealing with a boss who takes credit for your ideas. Use the following to help guide you through the potential hazards and pitfalls of the tough spot you’re in and hopefiilly make it through unscathed. Step 1: Evaluate the situation When you first start getting the feeling that your boss is taking credit for your ideas, your first step is not to unleash the fury on the powers that be in an effort at vengeance or retribution. Take a step back to get some valuable perspective and evaluate the situation. Is your boss really stealing your ideas or just aggregating and presenting the work for the team that reports to her or him? Are you absolutely certain that you’re not getting credit for your work? Just because you may not receive instant adulation for your ideas does not mean that your efforts are going unnoticed. Perhaps your boss is not the overly effusive sort, but nonetheless is appreciative of your contributions and is giving credit where it’s due in a subtle way, or is simply waiting for your next review period to give you your welldeserved welldeserved rewards? Bottom line — make sure you know for sure that your boss is stealing your ideas before taking things any further. has applied to fast-track a 2,400-unit project at a dying retail mall in Cupertino, exploiting the measure allowing builders to circumvent circumvent local approvals if they’re fulfilling unmet demand with at least half their units designated for affordable housing. Although Although Cupertino is the headquarters of Apple, its average home price of $1.8 million places it out of reach for the vast majority of the company’s employees. “We’re confident that the package will result in significant significant inroads” in the housing shortage, says Ben Metcalf, director of the Department of Housing and Community Development. “We’re equally confident that more will be needed.” The only real solution to the state’s housing crisis is to build more housing, including market-rate units for middle-class or even higher-income residents. It’s often supposed that loosening restrictions on market-rate housing will Step 2: Get a second opinion/witness Okay, so you’re fairly certain that your boss is indeed taking credit for your work—what should you do next? The next best step is to get a second opinion in an effort to have a witness to the situation in your comer. Why is this so important? Because without a witness, unless you have absolutely irrefutable evidence it’s basically your word vs. your boss’s, and in this scenario the boss often wins. Don’t put yourself in that scenario — instead, choose a credible and reliable witness, preferably someone with a little clout at your workplace, and help your case by having that person in your comer. It could make all the difference if you decide to take things further. Step 3: Document your case A strong, impassioned story and credible witness will go a long way towards supporting your claim of idea theft, but nothing beats a solid “paper trail.” Wherever feasible, have some ironclad evidence that documents the onerous events — everything from emails to recorded instances of theft and proof that the ideas were indeed yours to begin with will all serve to substantiate your claim. Nothing is more disheartening than making a bold claim of theft that you’re unable to prove and it ultimately goes nowhere. Not only will your work situation not improve, it will likely become even more uncomfortable for you there. Step 4: Communicate with your boss No, we’re not suggesting you kick open their office door and yell at them at the top of your lungs in an effort to get them to admit their wrongdoing. Instead, we’re saying that there may be a more peaceful and professional way to reach a satisfying conclusion. If you politely discuss the situation with your boss, they may be able to capably explain why you’re mistaken about what has transpired. Or maybe they’ll realize they’ve failed to properly give you the credit you’re due are willing to make amends. Often, the path of least resistance is the best one to take first. Hopefiilly your boss is reasonable enough to deal with, provided your approach is free from hostility and you’re open to reasonable and equitable compromise. If you think your boss might be profiting from your ideas without sharing the credit, take a breath, assess the situation and make your way through the measured and professional steps mentioned here. — Eric Titner, The Job Network foment gentrification of lower-income neighborhoods, neighborhoods, leading to forced evictions of their residents, but experts say that’s a myth. UCLA housing expert Paavo Monkkonen and two university colleagues have found little evidence that construction of market-rate and luxury apartments has cannibalized the supply of housing for low-income fam ili es. Of the 104 Los Angeles apartment projects built between 2014 and 2016 that they examined, 26 were built on vacant or nonresidential nonresidential parcels.

Everyone I spoke to pointed to navigation apps as the biggest culprit. A few also suggested the gentrification gentrification of Echo Park has reduced the number of residents who use transit and increased the number of drivers. The problem is that Baxter, with its Himalayan double dip between Allessandro Allessandro Street and Echo Park Avenue, is not a normal normal street, and it was never meant to be a thoroughfare. It was designed for goats, not people or cars. Whoever built it, more than 100 years ago, must have gone on to design roller coasters. A video of a daredevil daredevil skateboarder blasting down Baxter has had nearly 1.2 million views on YouTube. The Times has reported that Baxter ranks as the third-steepest street in Los Angeles with a 32% grade, behind 28th Street in San Pedro (33.3%) andEldred Street in Mount Washington (33%). Still, it’s on the list of the 10 steepest streets in the United States, seven of which are in California, and four of which are in Los Angeles, with Fargo Street in Silver Lake joining the others. Only two of the top 10 streets are in San Francisco, Francisco, which is often thought of as a city of hills, and the famous Lombard Street (27% grade) doesn’t crack the list. The steepest streets in the U.S. are in Honokaa, Hawaii, (45%) and Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa. (37%). On Baxter, whether you’re heading up the steepest steepest incline from Alle sandro on the west side of the peak, or Lakeshore on the east side, you don’t see pavement pavement in front of you through the windshield. You see sky, like you’re on a moon shot, blind to what might be coming at you from the other side of the mountain. “You have to have experience,” experience,” said Zsuzsa Paszterko, who lives in a 100-year-old wood-frame house at the peak along Bill adds pressure to prosecute [Legislation, from Bl] have been easier to charge officers under the proposed standard. In that case, Cleveland police responded to a 911 call mentioning someone who was pointing a gun outside a recreation center, and killed Tamir, who was holding a pellet gun. Officers pulled up within feet of Tamir and shot him less than two seconds after arriving. A grand jury declined to indict the officers, saying they reasonably reasonably feared for their safety. Activist groups cheered the announcement of Weber’s Weber’s bill Tuesday. Samuel Sinyangwe, co-founder of Campaign Zero, the policy arm of the Black Lives Matter Matter movement, said no state currently takes into account officers’ actions leading up to killings when determining whether to prosecute. Just four states — Delaware, Iowa, Rhode Island and Tennessee Tennessee — require officers to exhaust all other reasonable means before using deadly force, Sinyangwe said. Police Police killings in those states are 17% lower than in the rest of the country, according to data compiled by Sinyangwe’s Sinyangwe’s organization. “It’s a huge deal,” Sinyangwe Sinyangwe said of the bill. “It’s probably the biggest thing that can be done to address police shootings is to address address deadly force standards.” standards.” Robert Weisberg, a Stanford Stanford law professor and co-director co-director of the school’s Criminal Criminal Justice Center, said it would be hard to tell how much the law might change prosecutors’ ability to charge officers or gain convictions. convictions. No officer, he said, is going to say that it wasn’t necessary to use deadly force. And it’s unclear, he said, how long prior to specific specific incidents that an officer’s officer’s behavior could be scrutinized scrutinized as part of a criminal case. Still, Weisberg said the bill would add pressure to with husband Andrew, a dog, a cat, two roosters and six chickens she lets out of their coop every Thursday for “girls day out.” They lay eggs, eat insects and fertilize fertilize the lawn, so everybody wins, except the insects.

Craig Lally, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective Protective League, the union representing rank-and-file Los Angeles police officers, said in a statement that the bill ignores the dangers involved involved in policing and that LAPD training ensures that officers use deadly force only when it’s absolutely necessary. necessary. If the bill becomes law, Lally said, “it will either get cops killed or allow criminals to terrorize our streets unchecked.” “It’s one thing to criticize from your keyboard or from behind a microphone at a honking horns. “I use Lyft, and when the drivers see the hill they say, ‘Oh, my God!’ ” Beedy said. It may be that there’s no turning back from either the convenience of modem technology or the misery it wreaks. But Baxter Street resident Talkington said in an email to friends and neighbors that Councilman Mitch O’Farrell’s office asked the city Transportation Transportation Department to study the matter, and two possible solutions have been proposed. proposed. One is to turn Baxter Street into a one-way avenue avenue heading east, but as Talkington told me, that could create new traffic nightmares and penalize Echo Park residents trying to go west and north. The other is to prohibit left turns onto Baxter from press conference; it’s another another to actually work in the very real and dangerous world of policing,” he said. Ron Hernandez, president president of the Assn, for Los Angeles Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, had similarly strong words. He said in a statement that the measure would replace longstanding longstanding Supreme Court precedent with “an unworkable unworkable standard whose goal is to criminalize use of force by law enforcement.” Those at Tuesday’s news conference, however, said current policies must change. Activists called out the names of those they said were unnecessarily killed by police officers in recent years. Lawmakers also cited disparities in how police have used deadly force against black residents who turned out to be unarmed compared with other situations, situations, including a 2015 incident incident in which police took into custody a white man who had killed nine attendees attendees of a historically black church in South Carolina. “African Americans in this country and in the great Lakeshore Drive, a popular shortcut maneuver.

It’s L.A., and we all have to deal with traffic and with GPS apps, for better and for worse. “My thought is that if there was no left turn” onto Baxter from Lakeshore “on weekdays from 4 to 7 p.m., Waze would be legally obligated obligated to take it off their website and it would no longer show up,” Walker said.

On her annual visits to San Juan de Abajo, though, Elena began to see surprising changes: paved streets, more streetlights and people moving into the town to work in tourism. She longed to return.

Still, the Edies shine. By Gary Goldstein The strangely mesmerizing mesmerizing found-footage documentary documentary “That Summer” is a kind of prequel to 1975’s “Grey Gardens,” Albert and David Maysles’ landmark portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’ Onassis’ then-elderly aunt, Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (a.k.a. Big Edie), and Edith’s middle-aged middle-aged daughter, Edie Bouvier Bouvier Beale (Little Edie), who lived together in eccentric squalor in East Hampton, Long Island. The Maysles movie sparked a cultish fascination with the Edies, belatedly serving as the basis for the 2006 Tony Award-winning musical and an acclaimed 2009 HBO film starring Jessica Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore. Barrymore. All in, it was a pretty good run for such a quirky, esoteric esoteric and disturbing American American tale. But before all that, in the summer of 1972, socialite Lee Radziwill, BigEdie’s other famous famous niece (and Jackie’s younger sister), paired with writer-photographer Peter me, talking about the work they’d done, what they learned about the actors. “They went above and beyond, beyond, and it was very much appreciated. If Imagine Entertainment Entertainment [Howard and Brian Grazer’s company] had the opportunity to hire them, we’d be dancing in the aisles.” Analyzing his own approach, approach, Howard says as a director director he “applied three things, starting with my experience: experience: the logistics of the process didn’t intimidate me.” “Second was my creative objectivity. I could say with confidence I wouldn’t have come in if I didn’t believe in the possibilities of the story and cast. I didn’t have to say I didn’t need the job, but it was true. “Third was my excitement, excitement, I felt the thrill of the challenge, and that is infectious.” infectious.” Howard came to that excitement excitement honestly. In fact, he was probably one of the first people to hear about the original “Star Wars” when he worked for George Lucas as an actor in his 1973 “American “American Graffiti.” “Standing around in front of Mel’s Diner freezing at 3:30 in the morning, I asked what he was doing next and he said, ‘I kind of want to make a science fiction film, a Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers kind of movie with cliffhangers but to apply “2001: A Space Odyssey” technology to telling the story.’ “I nodded my head, but I didn’t think it was a good idea; science fiction was really a B genre in those days.” Five years later, when Howard and his wife saw “Star Wars” on Hollywood Boulevard, he felt differently.

At the same time, due to Suffolk County health inspectors’ inspectors’ threat to evict the Beales from their dangerously dangerously neglected mansion, Radziwill, funded by brotherin-law brotherin-law Aristotle Onassis, hired workmen to clean up the home’s longtime filth and decay and return its broken water and power sources to reasonable working order. Don’t even ask about the collection collection of cats and family of raccoons that had taken up residence there.

The Edies were nothing if not camera-ready: If reality TV was a thing back then, they would have been small-screen superstars. The women’s now-legendary now-legendary singing, prancing, prattling, prattling, squabbling, hoarding and ice cream scarfing, along with their nutty fashion sense, dubious hygiene, incongruous incongruous Brahmin accents, forays into French and generally generally slothful ways are on full and raw display.

The Yes campaign has raised nearly $24 million, much of it from the measure’s measure’s sponsor, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, headed by persistent government government gadfly Michael Weinstein. Nineteen California municipalities have some form of rent control, including including the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. But they’re all constrained by Costa-Hawkins. That brings us to the question of whether rent control is a good idea, including including whether it leads to more available housing, less or no change. This debate is generally waged between economists and urban planners. The former, consulting their textbooks and economic economic orthodoxy, are certain that rent control leads to less housing, on the principle principle that when you cap the price that can be charged for something, you’ll get less of it. Housing advocates examine the issue from the standpoint of existing renters, renters, who are protected from being priced out of their homes. Indeed, rent control generally becomes popular when affordable housing grows scarce — a housing shortage just after World War II produced some of the strictest such measures in U.S. history. A crisis is building building again. In California, more than 54% of renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing, a benchmark for unaffordability. unaffordability. Housing experts at UC Berkeley blame the cost of housing for the state’s persistently high poverty and homelessness rates. Even economists skeptical skeptical about rent control tend to acknowledge that it’s good for people living in rent-controlled units. They’re less sanguine about its other social effects. Stanford economist Rebecca Diamond and Fall 2018 Times m Education Classroom Study Program For students in grades 4-12, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Los Angeles Times have developed a study program Los Angeles Department of Water & Power into a timely and relevant lesson plan about water and energy conservation.

FOX 11 NEWS Fridays at noon and 5pm Rich Pedroncelli Associated Press PROPOSITION 10 would overturn the pro-landlord Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. Above, rent control supporters march in Sacramento in April. colleagues, examining the evolution of rent control in San Francisco from 1979 through the present, found in a recent paper that the law enabled a sizable percentage percentage of residents to remain in the city rather than being driven out. But they also asserted that it encouraged landlords to seek exemptions for their properties by converting them to condos or moving in because owner-occupied buildings also were exempt. As a result, they say, rent control ended up fueling the gentrification of San Francisco Francisco and increasing income inequality by creating more housing for rich tenants and condo buyers. (It’s probable that the tech-fueled housing demand in that city encourages encourages gentrification on its own.) The biggest mistake in discussions of rent control is viewing it in isolation. Rent control can’t address the housing affordability crisis on its own, and it won’t have much effect on housing availability by itself. On the other hand, it’s one housing policy that can be implemented implemented quickly and at low cost. “Making up for 40 years of insufficient rental housing housing production is going to take a minimum of another 20 to 30 years,” says Stephen Barton, a former housing director for the city of Berkeley and coauthor of a brief on rent control for UC Berkeley. “So what do you do when you have immense hardship now and the ultimate ultimate solutions are very long-term? Pretty much the only thing on the table is rent control.” Few would dispute that the neighborhood stability fostered by rent control is a crucial social good. “We know we value stability,” says USC professor Manuel Pastor, the lead author of a recent study on the virtues of rent stabilization. “But we don’t have tools to protect protect it for low-income renters. renters. Rent control should be seen as one tool in a toolbox. I can’t see why you would want to remove that tool.” In other words, the question question of whether rent control in general — or Proposition 10 in particular — will lead to more or less affordable housing is a distraction. Relieving the housing crisis requires such measures as streamlining the housing permit process and creating better incentives for construction construction of market-rate and affordable units. “Rent control is not a silver bullet, but without it, all the other solutions will come too late,” says Nicole Montojo, lead author of the Berkeley brief. The No on 10 advertising campaign has been remarkably remarkably fact-free (and misleading misleading when it claims to be purveying facts). It stands out even when compared with typical California ballot ballot measure commercial campaigns, which almost invariably are garbage. One theme of the No campaign’s commercials is that Proposition 10 has “no protection for renters, seniors, seniors, veterans or the disabled.” disabled.” But that’s just gaslighting. The proponents of Proposition 10 don’t claim it does — the measure’s goal is to place the protection of those groups into the hands of local officials, where it belongs. Another No on 10 TV ad features anti-tax crusader Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn, asserting that Proposition 10 would allow “unelected bureaucrats” to impose government fees on all housing. The claim is attributed in the ad to the state Legislative Legislative Analyst’s Office, but that misrepresents the LAG’S analysis. The LAO said that Proposition 10 would allow local governments governments to enact broader rent-control measures, some of which might involve fees on owners of rental housing — but that would be up to elected government officials and voters, not Coupal’s sinister “unelected bureaucrats.” My favorite part of this ad is the hand-wringing by Robert Gutierrez of the California Taxpayers Assn, about how Proposition 10 “puts taxpayers on the hook to defend it” if the measure gets challenged in court. Yes, it costs money to defend defend an enacted law from challengers, who in this case would probably be the real estate developers and other property owners who help to support campaigns by organizations like Coupal’s and Gutierrez’s. Gutierrez’s warning that taxpayers might have to defend the law against anti-tax advocates like himself is reminiscent of the ancient joke about a mafia hood visiting a shakedown target: “Nice little business you got here... Be a shame if something happened to it.” The right approach to Proposition 10 is to take it on its own terms. In and of itself it’s not a rent-control mandate, nor is it designed to bring new protections to renters or encourage the construction of new housing, housing, affordable or otherwise — those provisions are left to municipalities. The initiative initiative is an enabling measure aimed at giving them the flexibility to design rent control ordinances that fit their local conditions. If the initiative passes, we should expect communities communities with a majority of renters renters to consider expanding rent control. “My prediction is that Bakersfield [share of residents in rental housing: 43% ] won’t impose rent stabilization,” Pastor says. “But you would see it in Los Angeles and Long Beach, where the politics are different different and housing problems are more severe.” In those cities, about 60% of residents residents are renters. Too often, the argument against rent control boils down to the threat that landlords will be skinned, left without enough money or incentive to keep their properties in good repair. The history of rent control doesn’t lend much support to that fear. Nothing in Proposition 10 would prevent municipalities municipalities from creating rent control regimes that protect renters from abuse without depriving landlords of a fair return, as has been guaranteed guaranteed by a string of state court rulings. As long ago as 1983, a California appeals court ruled that a suitable rent control law would “permit an efficient landlord to pay all actual and reasonable expenses and receive a fair profit while... having affordable affordable and properly maintained maintained rental housing available available to the citizens of the community.” Pressure for rent control ordinances, the same court observed seven years later, would continue “so long as the state’s urban population continues to grow and the urban space available for new housing remains finite.” That’s where we are today, and a law that ties the hands of municipalities while offering home builders and landlords loopholes for evasion needs to go. CostaHawkins CostaHawkins was a boon for developers, but it didn’t avert a housing crisis. Proposition Proposition 10 won’t solve the housing crisis, but it will at least allow local city councils councils to try balancing protections protections for tenants while leaving leaving developers to build more.

Betting big on legal weed Off the strip, a splashy business bills itself as world’s largest dispensary T he employee in the red shirt counseled the two men on what — or what not — to buy. “Now, if you start thinking thinking dolphins are talking to you, that might be too much,” she explained. The two young men nodded slowly. One stroked his beard. Neither had ever talked to dolphins before. Or even yelled at them on Sundays when they play against the New England Patriots. Above them, the continuous continuous light show on the ceiling ceiling was like an electric lava lamp — orbs expanding and dividing in an endless trip. Then it was gone and replaced replaced by flowers and a Satum-like planet floating in the sky. Not many in Planet 13 — dubbed the marijuana superstore — were looking up, however. Most fixed their gaze downward at the rows of flat cases with glass tops. In them were small, clear containers that held dozens of different marijuana marijuana bud strains. Each container container was topped with magnified glass that revealed revealed details of the buds’ shapes and hues. It was reminiscent of seeing an ant leg under a microscope — spikier-than-expected edges and a maybe a little intimidating. A so-called budtender offered free smells to customers. customers.

The orb is visible from the top of the closest hotel — the one owned by President President Trump — and from windows of several other Las Vegas Strip casinos. Planet 13’s exterior is modem, modem, with areas of black metal walls and 13 LED lotus flowers 15 feet tall on the roof. A quote from Buddha Buddha about the lotus is inscribed inscribed on a plaque beside the orb. Mood matters too, apparently. The store is also within walking distance of a massive massive strip club, which is next door to the Erotica Museum and was recently remodeled to look something like a south Orange County retail outlet, with a sleek steel and stone exterior. The museum, museum, however, has retained its old-school Vegas architecture. architecture. Perhaps it’s the gentrification of vice. Planet 13 calls itself the world’s largest cannabis dispensary. It comes in at 40,000 square feet and features features more than 40 cash registers. “Size matters when you’re the biggest,” read branded T-shirts that are for sale. David Farris, marketing director for Planet 13, said that’s only the beginning for the store, which opened at the beginning of the month. There is still 72,000 square feet that the company plans to expand into, which means the place could eventually eventually be the size of a typical Costco. As Farris walked over the LED floor at the entrance, an electronic pond with lily pads and fish, sensors detected detected his footsteps and created ripple effects beneath beneath him. The electronic koi fish darted away when he stepped near one gliding below. There is an irony here. The store is huge, with wide-open and airy space all designed for the purpose of selling something that can be purchased legally only an ounce at a time. No need for giant shopping carts here. The easy comparison is to an Apple store, with clean lines, lots of glass and electronic electronic screens. Techno-style music plays loud enough to stir the senses, but also soft enough that conversations aren’t drowned out. It also appears to be one of the final moves toward making marijuana truly mainstream. When the product being sold is legal in a plurality of states, its stigma is diluted to the point that Hollywood stars openly use it with pride and a pot superstore can take its place among dozens of retail outlets. Perhaps it is simply the dawning of the new age of weed. Farris thinks so. He said the company has more plans. He opened up a door to reveal a large open space — about 2,000 square feet — that he imagines will be a coffee shop where people can hang out, work on laptops laptops and have a Starbuckslike Starbuckslike experience while also buying their marijuana. He opened another door and revealed what the building used to be: a massive massive beer distribution warehouse. warehouse. He said when his company obtained the site, it came with several safes that were used by the mob back when vice was virtually the only economic engine in Vegas. But the open space, with large bay doors and docking sites, could someday become become places for pot to be consumed on site in a lounge. That’s still a ways off, however, as pot can only be ingested legally in a private private residence. Like other states that have legalized recreational marijuana, Nevada is in the midst of trying to solve a puzzle — how to market pot to tourists tourists who have no legal place to actually consume it. “That’s the big question,” question,” Farris said. It’s also the most common common question asked of the budtenders who wander the floor at Planet 13 — named because “M” is the 13th letter of the alphabet and the number was long used as shorthand for marijuana. Zach Brengman, an employee who had just finished explaining the different effects of a few strains to a group of customers, customers, said he is always asked about where it can be consumed once purchased. He said he’s hopeful an answer will come soon as politicians and other leaders leaders wrangle over the emergence emergence of the marijuana economy — once underground underground — that now tops $500 million a year in Nevada. Nevada. For now, the Buddha inscription out front may offer a more philosophical point to ponder: “As the lotus rises on its stalk, unsoiled unsoiled by the mud and water, water, so the wise one speaks of peace and is unstained by the opinions of the world.” david.montero @latimes.com",11/24/2018,"('it', 's', 'the')","('vice', 'planet', '13')",[' Perhaps it’s the gentrification of vice.'], Perhaps its the gentrification of vice

Goldman clients have given to that committee as well as a second one called Community Support PAC. That committee has supported supported Jose Huizar and promoted promoted his political causes, sending mailers that featured featured him prominently. A third source said FBI agents have been looking at contributions made to both for-profit media-production business, The Muse Collective. Collective. It is unclear whether any other Celerity executives or board members will face political committees. Aaron May, an attorney for Families for a Better Los Angeles, would not comment comment on whether his client had received a subpoena, saying instead: “The committee committee will cooperate with inquiries it receives from any governmental agency.” Representatives for Community Support PAC did not respond to requests for comment. On Nov. 7, FBI agents hauled an array of materials from Huizar’s home and City Hall office, including a cardboard cardboard box with the word “fundraising” on it. The FBI declined to discuss discuss its investigation but confirmed last month that the Internal Revenue Service, Service, which looks into unreported unreported income, is involved. Huizar has not been arrested arrested or charged. Another source familiar with some of the FBI agents’ questions said investigators have asked about claims that Huizar ordered city employees employees to perform work for his personal benefit. Investigators have also posed questions about Huizar staffers allegedly receiving receiving cash payments from developers seeking to build in his district, the source said. Last month, The Times reported that Huizar assigned assigned city employees to raise money for a Catholic high school that employed his wife as a fundraiser. Experts Experts said the practice raised questions about whether the councilman was violating federal and state laws prohibiting the misuse of government resources. resources. During the time that Richelle Huizar worked for the school, money poured in from real estate developers, lobbyists, engineering firms and others who were seeking or had recently received favorable favorable votes from her husband, husband, according to interviews interviews with donors and documents documents obtained by The Times.

Both Goldman and Gastelum have deep ties to City Hall. Gastelum was an aide to then-Mayor Tom Bradley and at one point worked as a City Hall lobbyist. He now runs his own engineering and construction management management firm, Gateway Science and Engineering. He has previously found himself in the crosshairs of local and federal investigators. investigators.

In addition, the FBI informed informed prosecutors that it had recorded Gastelum discussing discussing a possible $l-million payment with a water district district official in San Diego County. That official alleged in court that it was an attempted attempted bribe. In each case, Gastelum denied wrongdoing and was never charged. Gastelum was one of the hosts of an October fundraiser fundraiser for Richelle Huizar’s council campaign. She later tweeted that he was one of the “great leaders” supporting supporting her candidacy. Goldman, in turn, was a high-level aide to former Councilmen Mike Hernandez Hernandez and Hal Bemson before opening his own lobbying firm in 2004. Over the last decade, his firm has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for city politicians, including more than $58,000 for Jose Huizar’s council campaign and officeholder committees, according to city records. In 2013, Goldman was contacted by Huizar about arranging for a contribution to Bishop Mora Salesian High School, where the councilman’s wife was working working as a fundraiser, according according to an email reviewed by The Times. Huizar contacted Goldman Goldman about securing a donation donation from billboard company Clear Channel Outdoor, the email stated. “Spoke with Morrie Goldman on 2/25. Morrie is their lobbyist,” Huizar wrote in the email. “We sent him info. Ask them to do 2 k like they did last year.” Clear Channel, which appeared before Huizar’s committee on the issue of digital billboards, has repeatedly repeatedly declined to comment comment on its charitable donations. donations. Last year, Goldman and others formed Families for a Better Los Angeles, which took in $200,000 in donations between December 2017 and June 2018, much of it from property owners and developers developers with projects in the downtown section of fornia said its investigation is ongoing. anna.phillips@latimes.com Twitter: @annamphillips Huizar’s district.

Charlie Woo, one of the company’s owners, said he has been impressed impressed with the Huizars’ work in revitalizing downtown downtown Los Angeles. “I thought that Jose and his wife did a good job,” he said. “So if they need help, I say, sure.” Richelle Huizar ended her campaign to join the City Council last month. Another donor to the political political committee was Realm Group, which plans to develop develop a 33-story building at 7th Street and Maple Avenue. In April, Jose Huizar and his council colleagues approved approved Realm Group’s project, project, despite objections from activists in skid row who said it would intensify gentrification gentrification of the neighborhood and lead to displacement of low-income renters. Five weeks later, Families for a Better Los Angeles reported taking in $10,000 from Realm Group, according to state contribution reports. Another Goldman client is Lightstone Group, which is developing the Fig + Pico hotel complex across from the city’s Convention Center. Center. Huizar and his colleagues colleagues voted for the project in May, giving Lightstone a change in zoning and an estimated estimated $103 million in taxpayer taxpayer assistance.

386,2248464683,"OP-ED Christina House Los Angeles Times IF IT ISN’T rush hour, Angelenos may have to wait 20 minutes for a Metro bus or a train connection. Metro must make fixes now for the riders it has Those of us who actually use the system are tired of waiting By Mehmet Berker L .A. Metro has a lot going for it. Its transit network is expansive and, compared with other U.S. cities, relatively cheap. You can travel across much of L.A. County for $1.75, making it affordable for the vast majority of residents. And it enjoys significant public backing. With the passage of Measure M in 2016, Angelenos overwhelmingly overwhelmingly voted to spend billions to improve the system. system. Unfortunately, it can also be a big pain to use. Outside of rush hour, 20-minute waits for buses and trains are the norm. And since buses rarely have their own lanes, they get stuck in traffic, making arrival times erratic and smooth transfers a roll of the dice. Bus shelters shelters and other creature comforts to help riders deal with the elements or long travel times are spotty at best. Worst of all are the safety concerns. A 2018 Metro survey revealed that 15% of bus riders and 21% of rail riders have experienced at least one incident of sexual harassment while using the system. For those of us who ride Metro, it’s no surprise that the system has lost an estimated 22% of its bus ridership over the last five years. Metro says it is taking these losses seriously. For the last year it has been working on what it calls the NextGen Bus Study. Due at the end of 2019, this study will propose new route and schedule changes, which should help make L.A.’s most trafficked bus lines more efficient. And that’s all well and good. But frankly, those of us who actually use the system are tired of waiting. There are any number of things that Metro can do now to make our rides better. The most obvious fix is all-door boarding on buses. All-door boarding is exactly what it sounds like: Riders are allowed to board the bus and pay at whichever door they please rather than everyone having to board through the front door. It’s a small change, but it’s a best practice for transit agencies around the globe — and it can make a big difference in travel times. In 2012, San Francisco’s transit agency Muni implemented implemented all-door boarding system-wide. After two years of all-door service, time spent at bus stops fell by 37%. This was a big win for transit riders, as bus stops account account for between 9% and 26% of total travel time. In 2015, Metro did an all-door boarding study on its crowded 720 Wilshire line. Amid flagging bus ridership, why they felt they needed to study, rather than just do something, is perplexing. But OK, they did their study. Then, a year later in 2016, they did another study on the A history of life and death ties us to Latin America By Mary Jo McConahay A s President Trump rails against border crossers from friendly countries to the south, it is worth observing that, when convenient to U.S. purposes, purposes, we have brought in our Latin Latin neighbors by the thousands, through binational agreements and even by force. During World War II, the United States kidnapped more than 6,000 residents of Latin American countries, countries, selecting those with German, Japanese or Italian roots, and transported them in ships’ holds or crowded cabins and in trains with blacked-out windows to concentration concentration camps, mostly in Texas. There they were held, sometimes for years, for potential use in trade for U.S. civilians caught behind enemy enemy lines in Europe and the Pacific. Pacific. At the same time, under an agreement with Mexico we imported imported hundreds of thousands of farmworkers farmworkers to cover a wartime labor shortage. The secret wartime capture operation, operation, called Quiet Passages, is a blight on our history. The WWII bracero program, which recruited Mexicans anxious for work, was a success, ensuring a stable food supply for U.S. troops and the home front. Unlike residents of other nations caught up in the war, Americans suffered little in their daily food intake. Eventually abuses crept into the bracero program; program; nevertheless, some 4.5 million million Mexican workers labored legally legally in the U.S. under the agreement agreement until it was terminated in 1966. On a spring day in 1943, six months after the bracero agreement agreement was signed, President Franklin Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mexican President President Manuel Avila Camacho sat side by side in high-backed chairs at a rose-covered banquet table in Monterrey, Mexico, trading viewpoints viewpoints that are important, even poignant, to remember. Geography made the border between the U.S. and Mexico, which was unfortified and undefended, undefended, “a natural bridge of conciliation conciliation between the Latin and the Saxon cultures of the continent,” Avila said. A year later, 300 fliers of Mexican Air Force Squadron 201 trained in Texas and Idaho before making bombing runs over Luzon and Formosa during the liberation of the Philippines and ferrying aircraft aircraft from Papua New Guinea to the Pacific theater for the Allies fighting Japan. Minerals vital for military equipment and ammunition ammunition flowed from Mexico to U.S. war Silver Line. Both of these studies told them what they already should have known: All-door-boarding improves improves arrival times. Naturally, the next step was to implement all-door boarding on the two lines that were studied, which Metro Metro did. In 2018. It took three years to roll out basic changes to two bus lines. So what about the rest of the system? Over the last year, almost all my local bus trips have been on buses moving toward having the necessary infrastructure for all-door boarding. Some buses already have working TAP readers at each door. (Great!) Some have working TAP readers at each door, but the bus driver won’t open all the doors. (C’mon!) Some have plastic bags over the TAP readers. (Classy!) Some have stickers by the doors that said “TAP” but no reader. (Huh?) This indecisive, spotty and generally incompetent approach to an obviously good idea is confusing and alienating riders even further. Why not just announce a system-wide rollout and get it done? Muni transformed its whole system in six months. And there are other things Metro can stop studying and implement right away. How about replacing our inexplicable inexplicable cloth seats with vinyl? Cloth seats can hide bed bugs, lice and other disgusting surprises. They’re also more expensive and labor-intensive to maintain than vinyl seats. Yet Metro continues to purchase vehicles vehicles with cloth seats while it conducts a test rollout of vinyl. vinyl. Yes, these upgrades cost money. But Angelenos voted to tax ourselves billions for Measure M because we want a better transit system. And while multibilliondollar multibilliondollar new rail lines take time, planning and significant regional cooperation, rider experience enhancements are fully under Metro’s control. Most Metro customers live below the poverty line and can’t afford a car. Though Metro talks about attracting attracting “choice” riders — people who own a car, yet choose to ride transit — a report last year from UCLA shows L.A. transit riders are increasingly choosing to drive as soon as they can afford to. Fully 79% of former Metro riders now primarily drive alone. What if — radical concept here — instead of focusing on luring new riders, Metro improves the system for those who use it now. If it can entice current riders to stay, former riders might return and new riders might be more inclined to give up their cars. To accomplish that, however, Metro needs to stop studying industry best practices and get them done.

Easing the sting of gentrification in Inglewood? By James T. Butts N ot that many years ago, few would have thought that the gentrification of Inglewood would be a cause for concern among the city’s residents and leaders. Yet major and historical development is leading many citizens citizens to ask: How will this personally benefit me? It’s been a hot topic at Inglewood City Hall since the city began its economic recovery at the end of 2012. Anxiety has increased as the future rises all around us. Chief among the developments are a a new, roughly $4.9-billion NFL stadium and entertainment district along Century Boulevard and a $14.5-million Frank Gehry-designed home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s youth orchestra. The perception, of course, is that high-profile construction projects projects like these, along with the relocation of the Rams and Chargers to Inglewood, will contribute to rising property values and rents — and force out longtime residents. This is already happening, and the city is taking steps to address it. People are also concerned about whether the city can make the axiom “a rising tide lifts all boats” ring true economically for as many residents as possible in Inglewood. The value of all this economic activity is enormous. Within the next decade, Inglewood is scheduled to host a Super Bowl, a college football national championship, a World Cup final and the opening ceremonies of the 2028 Olympic Games. In most any city in the country, developments such as these would be cause for proud celebration, but they are especially welcome welcome in a city that was headed toward bankruptcy after the Lakers and Kings left town in 1999 for Staples Center. For a city that tends to get dismissed as crime-ridden and gang-infested, the surge of economic economic opportunity is especially sweet. Our city budget, once mired in red in red ink, produced a $35-million surplus in fiscal 2018. As mayor of Inglewood, I can attest that our city is trying to help all residents benefit from the surge in the local economy as we work to ensure that the most economically vulnerable are not harmed. Our development agreements include local-hire provisions, which have helped produce a dramatic decline in Inglewood’s unemployment unemployment rate, from a high of more than 17% in 2010 to about 5% today. today. That drop compares favorably to Los Angeles County’s unemployment unemployment rate, which went from 13% in 2010 to about 4.5% today. A major project such as building a stadium would be expected to draw construction workers and tradespeople from broader Southern Southern California. Hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts for construction construction supplies and services would ordinarily go to preferred vendors vendors with no ties to the local community. Our agreements with the developers of the stadium and other projects set a 35% goal for local hires, which means they must live in an area with an Inglewood ZIP Code. More than 1,200 of the 3,000 people who strap on tool belts each day at the stadium site are from Inglewood or neighboring Lennox. In the first two months of 2019, they earned more than $55 million collectively in wages and benefits. Employers must file payroll data with the city every 60 days to show they are complying with the agreements, which also require that as many supplies and services as practical be secured through firms in Inglewood. By working closely with the developers of these projects, we are trying to benefit Inglewood residents and small businesses, which are sharing in the windfall of wages and profits from construction projects. More than half of the nearly 200 apprentices on the stadium construction construction site are previously incarcerated gang members, many of them from the area. As a former Inglewood deputy police chief, I find that fact particularly uplifting. Most are earning $60 to $90 an hour, including benefits, while learning life-changing trades as ironworkers, ironworkers, electricians and carpenters. These are people who once lived lives of criminality born of desperation and nonexistent opportunity opportunity At the behest of Inglewood, the stadium construction team has awarded 80 local minority and women-led businesses contracts for supplies and services estimated to be worth more than a half-billion dollars. The redevelopment also includes completed proj ects—the renovated renovated Forum and the Hollywood Park Casino — and the recently opened regional headquarters for the Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles. As Inglewood transforms into a major destination for entertainment entertainment and culture, we are taking steps to protect those who might be squeezed out by rising rents. About two-thirds of Inglewood residents residents are renters, so our restrictions will have a broad impact. After receiving reports of rents potentially doubling, I personally intervened with the owner of two apartment buildings, who ended up delaying the rate hikes by six months, trimming the rent increases increases by about two-thirds and offering a $10,000 relocation allowance allowance to residents who wanted to move. In March, the Inglewood City Council approved a temporary citywide moratorium on rent increases, limiting them to no more than 5% of current rent. This is a placeholder until we fashion a permanent permanent housing protection ordinance to protect renters and provide provide options for them. Will these moves be enough to ease the sting of gentrification in Inglewood? Time will tell, but we are heading in the right direction. James T. Butts has been mayor of Inglewood since 2011. A border wall, or even the threat of seeing their children held in cages, does not stop people from leaving. What would slow or stop them is positive change at home. Nobody wants to be a refugee. Among efforts that have helped to keep Latin Americans from fleeing fleeing north are private programs such as one a friend founded with private donations almost 30 years ago, which has benefited hundreds of Guatemalan children and their families, providing the shoes and books they must have for school, and after school, teaching skills that can be applied to professional work. I remember the first youngsters youngsters to join; they were living in the city dump, unable to read or write. Now they have jobs in government and media and run the program themselves. (They call themselves Fotokids, after the first skill they learned, photography.) They don’t want to leave their families, or Guatemala. Guatemala.

That Choi also now finds himself at the center of not one but two television series closes a circle in the career of the L.A. chef that began with TV. At rock bottom in the mid-1990s, after “a three-, four-year gambling spiral” spiral” and a routine of “basically just partying in K-town, sleeping on couches, getting into fights every night, getting drunk,” his life was saved by an episode of Emeril Lagasse’s Lagasse’s Food Network series “Essence “Essence of Emeril”: “Watching that show gave me one last hope.” Already airing and streaming is the terrific “Broken Bread,” a coproduction coproduction of KCET and the webbased webbased video platform Tastemade, which looks at food and food systems systems with an eye toward social justice, justice, sustainability and personal empowerment. (New episodes air Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. on KCET and can be streamed from the KCET and Tastemade websites.) “This show in a way is a bit of a battle battle cry,” Choi told me recently when we met to talk at a Korean coffee house in a strip mall built where an earlier mall burned in the 1992 riots. The series, which makes good use of host Choi’s sweetness and urgency, urgency, is often moving as it focuses on individuals finding innovative solutions to food-related social problems, or addressing social problems through food. Subjects include access; waste (“not only wasted food, but how we waste people”) people”) ; veganism and alternatives to meat; the gentrification of cannabis; cannabis; the transformative power of kitchen work; and a history of Watts, which includes the story of Locol, the healthful-alternative fast food restaurant Choi and Michelinstarred Michelinstarred San Francisco Daniel Patterson Patterson opened in Watts in 2016. (Locol (Locol losed last August, but the partners partners continue to pay rent on the space as they work on what Choi calls “Locol 3.0,” envisioned as a “tech-based delivery service app”; meanwhile, says Choi, “If you call, we will cater.”) Choi’s other series is “The Chef Show,” a charming food-andfriendship food-andfriendship show done in collaboration collaboration with director-actor Jon Favreau. It premieres Friday on Netflix and takes its inspiration from the “cooking-to-camera” shows Choi grew up on. He worked as an adviser on Favreau’s 2014 food-truck road film “Chef,” and the two clicked; this show, which features celebrity guests and fellow chefs, was created partly as an excuse excuse for them to hang out. One episode, episode, featuring “Good Food” radio host Evan Kleiman and Jitlada proprietor proprietor Jazz Singsanong, is partly an homage to the late Times food critic, and early Choi supporter, Jonathan Gold. Where did you grow up exactly? Right here, on the Vermont side, mostly, and then I moved to Orange County in high school. How different was that? The transition was tough for me, but looking back, I think it built a lot of who I am. I’ve lived through a lot of different neighborhoods. neighborhoods. In L.A. we moved seven times, and in Orange County, we moved three, four times, from apartments to suburbs, inside and out. I know what it’s like to be a teenager in Orange County, I know what it’s like to be a kid in L.A., I know what it’s like to not have any money and have your lights turned off. And so when we first started serving the taco, spiritually I was able to tell a story a lot of people could relate to, from Whittier to Van Nuys, Koreatown to Carson. What was your experience of food as a child? I was a latchkey kid. My parents worked and sold and hustled. But in a Korean household, you’re always eating with your family no matter what, and you’re always cooking. And our food is not one you can just open a package and eat; a lot of our food takes time to develop. It needs to ferment, it needs to pickle, it needs to cook for hours. When I moved to Orange County, I got introduced to cereal and Pop Tarts, granola bars. That was a whole new world for me too. I also grew up in a Korean restaurant. A lot of relatives had hamburger shops, so I ate a lot of that. My dad really liked going to Japantownand Chinatown. Before I was bom, he worked at Grand Central Market and Lawry’s, so we would go to Lawry’s or Benihana for special occasions; Yoshinoya was a big treat for us. Clifton’s, the Pantry, burger stands, Norm’s coffee shop, Ships Coffee Shop, taco tmcks, tamales, Tommy’s chili — it was all that tme L.A. food, for that time. One of the themes of “Broken Bread” is that working with food can transform your life. Definitely. A lot of us don’t fit into the traditional educational system and are, I don’t want to say victims, but we’re casualties of a system that doesn’t consider diverse diverse backgrounds and financial situations. It’s that cycle we’re exploring on the show — communities communities that need nutrition the most have the least; communities that need art programs the most don’t have them. The thing about the kitchen is it’s very much a handson handson learning program. A lot of us who don’t register information in an intellectual way are able to really rise in an environment that allows us to be ourselves. A kitchen remains a place you can stumble into and find yourself. The hands-on part is something something we’ve lost touch with. We don’t give enough power to the intelligence of our feeling, our love, our emotions. Those things are the value system in the kitchen. Emotion, Emotion, sensitivity, love, caring, dexterity. dexterity. Does “The Chef Show” feel like a fulfillment of watching Emeril all those years ago? Most definitely; I grew up on Paul Prudhomme, Sarah Moulton, “America’s Test Kitchen,” Emeril, Julia Child and “Jacques and Julia,” Ming Tsai, Sam Choy, Martin Martin Yan. It’s something that I always always dreamed of doing, but I’m not a natural-bom entertainer — I didn’t think I could hold a camera on my own. Even if you look at “Broken Bread,” I’m pushing the camera outward versus being on me. But having Jon by my side allowed me to be me, and he could carry the camera. I always wanted a cook-to-camera show; “Broken Bread” is my activist side, but this is my chef side. The great thing is that we don’t have any made-forTV made-forTV stuff—it’s not like we’re pulling a fully baked pie out of the oven. The show is like a podcast, and through the episode you see the whole dish being made. What’s the status of Locol? We’re still alive, trying our best. We really believed in what we were doing, and still do. Just financially, it didn’t work. We were open for almost three years. It wasn’t like we opened and a month later we closed. When we announced, “Hey, we’re going to take a step back, we’re going to rethink this model,” it was just so easy to point the finger and say, “You failed.” But we created a lot of new jobs — cooks have moved on to the restaurant Alta Adams, they’ve moved on to other kitchens, they’ve moved on to my kitchens here in L.A. And we TWO FANS STRUGGLE WITH THEIR LOVE OF DISNEYLAND THE MAGIC KINGDOM, E6-7 created offshoot companies, like the Ambassadors, which is a security security program. We invested almost $3 million in the community. We paid salaries for over 40 people for three years; we created subsidiary jobs in construction, construction, demolition, painting, art. I know this is not tangible, but there were three years of memories created, especially with the children, children, that will always be there. Maybe I’m a little idealistic, but to me, those things mean something. You can’t judge everything on this binary code of success or failure. We still have the building, Even when we announced our closing of the retail site, we’ve still paid rent to be there every single day. We are running catering out of it and developing our 3.0 version, which will be, like, a tech-based delivery service app, but it’ll still have the foundational elements of Locol: Start with the community, hire from the community, work within the community, serve all-natural ingredients, wholesome food, and be a resource and a peace center for the community. It reminds me of Mar Diego, in the “Transformation” episode, who puts at-risk kids to work in her pizza place, Dough Girl. Yeah. In our world, we’re so macro on everything, but the way we work, Mar and I, she’s very micro — it’s like, “If I can help one kid, to me that’s a success.” That’s the same way we looked at Locol. For Mar, it’s one kid, one pizza, one step at a time. And then these kids carry that skill and move on. And that’s a big part of what drives me as well. I always think of future generations when I try to do something. something. We have to come to the point where we admit where things are really as bad as we think they are, but the solution is probably not as hard as we think it is. My dream is that “Broken Bread” becomes the hottest show on TV. What I mean by that — I want to really put this in context — is that what we’re covering will drive popular culture, the idea of loving and caring and challenging these problems. Because to me it’s a little bit of follow the leader — if this hits, then other studios will say, “We need a social justice show as well,” and that will drive the conversation and the marketplace. I’m excited to see if that could happen. Tony Bourdain was definitely definitely swimming in those waters and people were interested. Jonathan Jonathan Gold was writing about this and people were interested. So I hope we can continue that lineage. UNDERRATED Movies: Apart from the semi-annual tilt-a-whirl of blockbusters from Marvel, “Star Wars” and whatever else might soon become a theme park ride, the act of going to movies feels endangered. endangered. They’re cost-prohibitive, cost-prohibitive, the studios are more risk-averse than ever, and why bother going out when Netflix just dropped seven new shows since you started reading this sentence? Unlike TV, the best movie experiences require focus removed from our phones and chattering brains. The films that reward that focus may seem harder to find, but two hours of undivided attention is worth a $15 ticket alone. California: It’s 840 miles of dramatic coastline as well as ancient forests, majestic mountains and more natural natural wonders in parks than typically found on entire continents. Creative people from all over head south to tell their stories in music, TV and film or head north toward a never-ending Gold Rush of innovation that might actually help save the planet. Its mix of cultures and climates contains the entire world, and despite (or perhaps because of) its many problems, this is what the future looks like. For all its troubles, California can handle anything, and you should stop moving here. OVERRATED California: It’s hot. It’s crowded. Each year home prices reach a new, absurdly expensive height. And when it’s not under a constant threat of drought and wildfire, wildfire, there is, for the past few months at least, a sudden and surprising penchant for rain. To the south, the state traffics in mythic and unattainable unattainable ideals for beauty and success, and to the north, it “disrupts” businesses, businesses, social habits and, well, civilization with technology technology driven by profit and world domination with no regard for consequences. For all its promise, California California is a mess, and you should stop moving here. TV: If there’s not another can’t-miss show debuting tomorrow, it’s a brand new streaming outlet, which only wants 10 more dollars a month to go on top of what you spend on the four or five services that you pay for already. And since our TVs got bigger and broadband got broader, there’s little reason to leave the house for entertainment. It’s not that so many choices are bad, but if you count how many of those shows really left an personal impact amid all that noise they would probably probably still fit on just four channels. — Chris Barton Editor’s note: Barton is leaving California for a new life in Oregon; this is the last Overrated/Underrated column.

Jimmie and Mont, both working-class African Americans in their 20s, may cast occasional bemused glances at the influx of young, affluent white residents residents in their rapidly gentrifying gentrifying city. But they also don’t really fit in with the other black guys in their neighborhood, neighborhood, several of whom hold court on the same street every every day, like a kind of ebulliently ebulliently trash-talking Greek chorus. Jimmie and Mont are quieter quieter by temperament. Mont works as a fishmonger, but he is also an aspiring artist and playwright; we see him drawing in his sketchbook and watching classic films on TV, patiently summarizing the plot for his blind grandfather grandfather (Danny Glover). Jimmie Jimmie works as an elder-care nurse, though his real job is preserving the memory of that old Victorian, his childhood childhood home. Years after his father (a seething Rob Morgan) Morgan) lost the property, Jimmie Jimmie still regularly drops by to touch up the paint and tend to the garden, much to the ‘The Last Black Man in San Francisco* Rated: R, for language, brief nudity and drug use Running time: 2 hours Playing: ArcLight Cinemas, Hollywood; Landmark, West Los Angeles chagrin of the house’s current current occupants. But when the house is abruptly vacated and put on the market, Jimmie seizes his opportunity and secretly moves in with Mont, working tirelessly to restore the place to its former glory. The house, even more lovingly photographed from inside, is a squatter’s paradise with its antique furnishings and intricate intricate woodwork. But it is also a rich repository of old memories and mythologies, as well as an argument that true ownership transcends matters of title and deed. According to family lore, Jimmie’s grandfather built the house, detail by ornate detail, in the 1940s. There weren’t many black people in the city back then — his grandfather was jokingly hailed as the first, Jimmie says—until the thousands of Japanese Americans who once populated the Fillmore were sent to internment camps during World War II. That cruel uprooting, briefly acknowledged here, coincided coincided with the arrival of African African Americans fleeing oppression oppression in the South, many of whom moved into the Fillmore Fillmore and began working in the city’s shipyards. By the time this movie opens, several generations have passed and another cultural cultural migration has taken place. Like “Blindspotting” and “Sorry to Bother You,” last year’s notable Oaklandthemed Oaklandthemed double bill, “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” Francisco” casts a skeptical eye at the Bay Area tech boom and its displacement of an already already marginalized minority population. But in tone, style and rhythm, the movie bears little resemblance to those earlier pictures (which did not, of course, particularly resemble each other). Jimmie’s story is too specific specific and personal to be dismissed dismissed as a simple narrative of socioeconomic discontent, and it carries a droll vein of humor that inoculates the movie against self-pity. Jimmie Jimmie and Mont may be reserved reserved on the surface, but they are also unwitting folk heroes in a contemporary urban urban picaresque. Their emotions emotions find expression not only in their work — a play Mont is writing, the labor Jimmie pours into his old home — but also in the filmmaking, filmmaking, in the intense hues of Adam Newport-Berra’s cinematography and the churning, majestic strains of Emile Mosseri’s score. (“The Last Black Man in San Francisco” Francisco” won two jury prizes at the recent Sundance Film Festival, including one for Talbot’s direction.) Fails, a first-time actor, has the kind of effortless, open-hearted screen presence presence that would brighten even a less autobiographical narrative. He and Majors at times achieve the winsome rapport and understated pathos pathos of a great silent-comedy duo. (That extends to the endearingly endearingly mismatched outfits outfits they wear day after day: Jimmie in a red plaid shirt, Mont in a light brown sports coat.) The characters’ friendship friendship lends the story an easy emotional anchor, but it crucially crucially does not dictate the limits of “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” or its range of dramatic interest. With the exception of an opportunistic real estate agent (Finn Wittrock) who is the closest thing here to a conventional villain, nearly every character we meet suggests suggests a deep inner life beyond the frame. These include Jimmie and Mont’s friend Kofi (an excellent Jamal Trulove), one of many individuals individuals who subtly dismantle whatever assumptions the audience may harbor about black masculinity. There’s a street preacher (Willie Hen) whose sermons are a mostly unheard rebuke to public complacency and also a longabsent longabsent figure from Jimmie’s childhood who throws his personal tragedy into sharp, sudden relief. A patchwork of impressions, impressions, ruminations and unsolved unsolved mysteries, “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” teems and even overflows with life and love, some might argue at the cost of narrative focus or momentum. momentum.

161,2297178497,"OPINION EDITORIALS What will 'ethnic studies’ be? The proposed new curriculum is a melange of academic jargon and political correctness. I n a state as diverse as California, with all the social, historical and economic issues that arise from our rapidly changing demographics, the idea of offering offering an ethnic studies course in public public high schools is more than a nice notion; it’s critical to imbuing students with an understanding of their own history and that of others. A bill now working its way toward the governor’s desk would do something about that, requiring students to take an ethnic studies course for graduation, most likely replacing a semester of geography. That’s a good thing. History has for too long been told by the winners, who have often left out the unsavory and sometimes tragic aspects of the story. But ethnic studies courses have little chance of succeeding if they don’t stem from a strong curriculum that challenges students students to read, listen, gather facts, analyze those facts and think critically about the controversial issues that will naturally arise. Unfortunately, this is precisely where the state is in danger of letting its students down. The goal of the new course is to help students learn about and engage with the history and culture of groups that have been overlooked, marginalized or subjected to “invisibility.” But a current draft of the model model curriculum, drawn up by a committee of teachers and academics and headed to the State Board of Education, is an impenetrable impenetrable melange of academic jargon and politically politically correct pronouncements. It’s hard to wade through all the references to hxrstory and womxn and misogynoir and cisheteropatriarchy. We have no objection to a course that broadens students’ thinking about race and gender and sexuality and history and power. But too often the proposed ethnic studies curriculum feels like an exercise in groupthink, groupthink, designed to proselytize and inculcate more than to inform and open minds. It talks about critical thinking but usually offers offers one side and one side only. Consider this passage on assigning students students to engage with their communities: “For example, if students decide they want to advocate for voting rights for undocumented undocumented immigrant residents at the school district and city elections, they can The housing California needs At this rate, the state won’t come close to Gov. Newsom’s goal of building 3.5 million units by 2025. A t a time when California desperately desperately needs to be building a lot more housing to ease the statewide shortage that is driving driving up prices and fueling homelessness, homelessness, the pace of residential construction construction is going down instead of up. Even as Sacramento and local governments governments began taking small steps to make it easier to build, permits for new housing fell 16% over the last year. That may not sound like a dramatic drop, but the slowdown is bad news for a state that already has a serious housing deficit. California should be building about 180,000 units per year to keep up with demand, demand, state officials have said, but construction construction permits for only about 93,000 residential residential units were issued over the last 12 months, according to the Public Policy Institute Institute of California. Real estate development is cyclical and there are boom and bust periods. But many Californians seem to think the state is already already overdeveloped and that a slowdown would be preferable to an increase. Yet the truth is that residential construction has never returned to levels seen before the Great Recession, despite the state’s strong economy and job market. That has exacerbated exacerbated an existing shortage created by a decades-long decades-long failure to build enough housing to keep up with population growth. The result? Growing housing inequality and a sense that California’s best days are in the past. The state has the nation’s highest poverty rate when housing costs are factored factored in. The lack of affordable housing units is driving an epidemic of homelessness. homelessness. Even many people who don’t become homeless often cannot afford to live in urban urban areas, and have to move to far-flung suburbs and commute hours to where the Eos Angeles ©lines FOUNDED DECEMBER 4,1881 develop arguments in favor of such a city ordinance ordinance and then plan a meeting with their city council person or school board member.” member.” No problem with that per se, and community community engagement is a fine way to involve students in politics and civic life. But there is no mention here — or just about anywhere anywhere in the curriculum — of students who might dare to disagree with the party line. In this case, for instance, some students might think that the right to vote in mayoral and city council elections is the prerogative of citizens, not noncitizens (that’s not a right-wing idea, is it?), and they might want to meet with the school district about that. Chances are, with a curriculum like this one, they’d be afraid to even mention it. Similarly, there’s a suggested list of social movements that students might research — but here again, the curriculum feels awfully one-sided. There’s nothing wrong with students students studying the Black Panther Party or the Third World Liberation Front or the Occupy Occupy Movement or the Palestinian-led BDS movement. But what happened to studying a range of ideas, reflecting a variety of ideologies ideologies and perspectives, and having students take sides, dispute and debate those ideas, honing their research and thinking in the process, and ultimately deciding for themselves? themselves? This curriculum feels like it is more about imposing predigested political views on students than about widening their perspectives. perspectives. Among other things, the model curriculum curriculum lists capitalism with white supremacy and racism as “forms of power and oppression.” oppression.” OK, but shouldn’t students also hear arguments that capitalism has allowed for an expansion over time of the middle class, or even from those who believe in a laissezfaire, laissezfaire, sink-or-swim economy? And isn’t it possible that some students won’t agree with the curriculum’s assertion that BDS is a social movement “whose aim is to achieve freedom through equal rights and justice.” Does that perhaps merit further further debate? School districts will be free to pick and choose from the model curriculum that is eventually approved, but they would probably probably rely heavily on the approved document. Though the draft, which is open to public comment until Aug. 15, offers many interesting interesting ideas, it is in bad need of an overhaul. The final curriculum should emphasize the deep, disturbing and complex facts of racial and ethnic history, respecting differences of opinion, and encouraging open discussion on an often difficult subject. jobs are, worsening traffic and air pollution. On the campaign trail, Gov. Gavin Newsom Newsom said he wanted the state to build 3.5 million homes by 2025 to end the housing shortage. At the current pace, it’s hard to imagine that California will come close to that goal. At least, not without major changes to the state’s housing policies. And so far, state and local lawmakers don’t seem to have the political will for major change. To appease legislators, Newsom had to water down a proposal to withhold transportation transportation dollars from cities that have shirked their responsibility to build enough housing to meet their needs. Some local elected officials in Southern California are fighting efforts to get them zoned for more apartments and affordable housing. And earlier this year, state legislators put on hold a proposal by Sen. Scott Wiener (DSan (DSan Francisco) that would have overridden local zoning laws to allow mid-rise apartment apartment buildings to be constructed within half a mile of major transit stops or in “jobs-rich” areas, including single-family neighborhoods neighborhoods that are now off limits to such development. development. Opponents in the Legislature said it went too far and they decried the loss of local control, yet they did not put forth a compelling alternative that would help build a lot more housing near transit and job centers. To be sure, there are lots of reasons for the construction slowdown, only some of which local and state policymakers can control. control. There is a shortage of construction workers, driven in part by the crackdown on immigration. It’s also gotten more pricey for builders to buy construction materials as cities have had to rebuild after floods and wildfires and after President Trump slapped tariffs on wood and steel. Builders and lenders are also being more cautious amid fears that a recession is looming. But in many cases, local elected officials are the ones who decide whether new homes get built or not, and far too often, they say “no.” California has to reduce the barriers to building if the state is ever going to end its housing shortage.

Some candidates criticized Obama policies. Boosting Trump Re “Who won the Democratic debates? Donald Trump” Republican advisor Scott Jennings could not be more right about how President Trump wound up winning the Democratic candidates’ debates last week. The debaters were mostly a collection of dreamers who know very little about economics and propose spending tons of money on pipe dreams — money that a country with $l-trillion annual federal budget deficits does not have. There were also blatantly unqualified people like mayors and one-issue grievance bearers on the stage. Only a focused centrist who is an economic realist with a clear, unifying message for the country has any chance of defeating our reality-TV president. The stakes could not be higher, but the Democrats’ present course ensures Trump’s reelection. Betty Turner Sherman Oaks I love reading Jennings’ articles, because he consistently consistently interprets things so incorrectly. Jennings says the Democrats are now bashing bashing President Obama’s legacy on healthcare. He believes the American healthcare system is Obamacare, Obamacare, when in reality Obamacare is only a small part of what we have today, and it has been severely crippled by our current president’s poisonous injections. Most health economists would tell you that the United States has some of the world’s best hospitals and doctors, but it also has the industrialized world’s worst healthcare system. For example, what is a hospital bill? Well, it depends depends — if you are uninsured uninsured it may be huge, but if you have one type of insurance insurance it is likely to be smaller than if you had another policy. Or it could be covered fully. Or if you are impoverished, then there is perhaps no way the hospital will be paid anything. anything. Why exactly is Medicare not allowed to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies companies on prices? Explain that, Republicans. Dave Haberman, M.D. Woodland Hills You have to hand it to Jennings for being so faithful faithful to Republican Party talking points.

After a decade of obstructing obstructing and pillaging Obamacare, Obamacare, the system may not be functioning as intended. intended. What have Trump and the GOP proposed? That can be summed up as this: The uninsured and underinsured underinsured in American need to suck it up and start writing bigger checks for their healthcare.

But Trump slyly has avoided specifying when America was great, nor has he said what made it great. There’s no need for him to do so — not where the president’s cynical dogwhistles dogwhistles recall those halcyon halcyon mid-20th century days when blacks were kept in the back of the bus, gays were kept in the closet, closet, and women were kept pregnant and in the kitchen. Some demagogues strive to rewrite history. Others glaze it over or ignore it altogether. Either way, the more historical truths are distorted or ignored, the more imperiled imperiled our future becomes. Sandra Perez Santa Maria, Calif. Bacevich is right. We no longer share a unified sense of the past. “Manifest Destiny” was once the unifying view of our past, but divisions over that began in the 1970s. Then, some historians viewed our history mostly positively, and others saw it negatively, almost as a catalog of crimes against man and nature. These two divergent views of the past have culminated in today’s social divergence. Bacevich strays into partisanship when he puts much of the blame on Trump. But, as the saying goes, it takes two to tango, and you have a choice whether to hate someone. A large segment of our country has chosen to hate the president; people on that side condemn themselves themselves to political impotency impotency by seeing the president’s president’s actions only as extension of his persona. Hence, they became the president’s dance partner. I agree with Bacevich — that “dance” is unlikely to stop in 2020. Jack Kaczorowski Los Angeles 'No collusion’ is a talking point Re “Not impressed by Adam Schiff,” letters, Aug. 1 I strongly object to the L. A. Times publishing right-wing talking points on the letters page without editorial comment explaining explaining why they are wrong. In Thursday’s paper, you published a letter deriding House Intelligence Intelligence Committee Chairman Chairman Adam B. Schiff (DBurbank) (DBurbank) for claiming to have “secret evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. In fact, as Schiff has stated, his evidence isn’t secret at all, but offered publicly two years ago by Donald Trump Jr. himself, who received — and forwarded forwarded — emails offering (illegal) campaign assistance assistance from “crown prosecutor prosecutor of Russia.” Trump’s written response was, “I love it,” and he held a meetingin meetingin Trump Tower. None of this is in dispute. Although former Justice Justice Department special counsel Robert S. Mueller III concluded this exchange exchange did not reach the threshold of criminal conspiracy, conspiracy, the words “no collusion” do not appear anywhere in his report. Gary Davis Los Angeles One letter writer urges the Democrats to “accept the Mueller report” and move on, because Russia is not a major threat. Clearly, he has not read the Mueller report or the subsequent bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee Committee report. Both outline the clear and present danger danger posed by the Russian’s “sweeping and systematic” attack on our very democracy. democracy. Mueller has expressed expressed that the threat posed by Russia is among the most serious challenges challenges he has ever seen. We can keep our democracy democracy only if we are willing to fight for it. Thomas D. Penfield Cardiff, Calif. Luxury tower bus riders? Re “Is Amoeba Music a landmark?” editorial, July 28 Your editorial invoking the film “L.A. Story” in response to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s quest to preserve the Amoeba Music building in Hollywood and some of its architectural and cultural elements, as well as revisit a luxury housing development development that fails to meet even the minimum number of legally required lowincome lowincome housing units, surely brought a Sunday morning smile to many readers’ faces. However, a more apt film reference might be “Field of Dreams,” for if you build it — more and taller luxury housing at rail stops — they still will not ride. In June, the L. A. Times reported that Metro was “hemorrhaging” bus passengers, passengers, as ridership has fallen by more than 25% over the last decade. As you note, the project in question is “about a halfmile halfmile from a subway station,” station,” but does anyone in Los Angeles honestly think residents of this new luxury luxury building will be taking the bus or train? As the twin crises of homelessness and housing affordability continue to roil L.A., our elected officials officials supercharge gentrification gentrification of the city and the destruction of neighborhoods neighborhoods with ill-considered approvals of developments like this that do little, if anything, to address the actual problems.

Apt analogy Re “They came for us, letters, Aug. 2 In trying to show the difference between migrant migrant detention centers and Nazi-era concentration concentration camps, the writer who said she fled Austria at the age of 6 in 1938 uses the wrong analogy. Here’s the right one: What if, when she arrived with her family seeking refuge, she was separated from her parents and denied denied any contact with them; held in horrific, inhumane conditions; and then sent back to Austria?

THEATER REVIEW Matthew Murphy The musical is at the Pantages. We’d love to love you, 'Summer’ A musical about the ’80s superstar? Sign us up. Or we would if the show held together. By Margaret Gray In a crowded field of contenders contenders for jukebox musicalization, musicalization, Donna Summer doesn’t just stand out, she hustles to the front of the line. Summer co-wrote and recorded recorded some of the definitive pop hits of the 1970s and ’80s, so the score is a guaranteed draw, and her fan base has aged to perfection: We’re tenderly tenderly nostalgic, financially settled and, despite a twinge here and there, still willing to get up and dance. Furthermore, Summer’s life story ticks all the bio-musical bio-musical boxes: Childhood trauma. Meteoric rise to fame. (Her sexy breakout hit “Love to Love You Baby” earned her the rhapsodic if condescending sobriquet “The Queen of Disco,” which she spent the rest of her career career trying to transcend.) Drug addiction. StarHe’s StarHe’s learned to be a young Andy Warhol [Chariton, from El] that when he gets up there he at least does it fluidly.” Eventually, through practice practice and consultation with the designers, Chariton settled settled on a style: a plump, heart-shaped fruit, executed economically and whimsically. whimsically. In spite of the title and the startling quantity of tomato images it has generated, “Andy Warhol’s Tomato” really isn’t about tomatoes. Playwright Melocchi grew up in Pittsburgh, also Warhol’s hometown. There’s a lot of local lore about places where the teenage Warhol hung out and works of art he may have left behind. (He was said to doodle on bar napkins while drinking CocaCola.) CocaCola.) Out of these legends, Melocchi dreamed up a story about an unlikely friendship between Warhol—an art student student at what was then called Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Carnegie Mellon University) — and a middle-aged bartender, bartender, Bones (played by Keith Stevenson). Thrown together together by fate in the basement basement of Bones’ bar, they discover discover a shared passion for the beauty in ordinary, overcrossed overcrossed love. Exploitation and betrayal by the music industry. industry. The death of disco. Bom-again Christianity. Lung cancer. And before her death in 2012, one last comeback comeback — older but wiser, rocking rocking a jumpsuit. With songs this catchy, a musical’s book doesn’t have to be great. Or at least this is the calculus that I ascribe, perhaps unjustly, to the creators creators of “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” which just opened at the Hollywood Hollywood Pantages Theatre after after running on Broadway in 2018.1 can’t know for certain that “Summer” book writers Colman Domingo, Robert Cary and Des McAnuff (who also directed) looked at one another over the adding machine where they were totting up future ticket sales and wondered, “Does the audience audience really need a coherent narrative when ‘Bad Girls’ is up next?” Based on the show they came up with, I can’t completely completely rule out that scenario. scenario. Three actresses share the role of Donna, a familiar strategy (also employed by another jukebox, “The Cher ‘Andy Warhol’s Tomato’ Where: Pacific Resident Theatre, 703 Venice Blvd., Venice When: 8 p.m. Thursday to Saturday, 3 p.m. Sunday, through Sunday Tickets: $25-$34 Info: (310) 822-8392, pacificresidenttheatre.com Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes looked things. Like tomatoes. tomatoes. While Melochhi was developing developing the play, Chariton and Stevenson participated in staged readings as Warhol and Bones. (All three are Pacific Pacific Resident members.) At first they had only a few scenes woven into a larger plot about the gentrification of working-class neighborhoods neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. Everybody Everybody wanted more of the Warhol-Bones dynamic, which eventually crowded out everything else. A drama for eight became a twohander. twohander. That’s when things ‘Summer: The Donna Summer Musical’ Where: Hollywood Pantages Theatre, 6233 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles When: 8 p.m. Tuesdayto Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 1 and 6:30 p.m. Sunday; ends Sunday Info: (800) 982-2787, HollywoodPantages.com or Ticketmaster.com Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes Show”) that sounds like it might lead to a temporal paradox paradox but turns out to be a smart allocation of resources in cases of stars who contain multitudes. The Donnas are labeled in the program as Diva Donna (Dan’yelle Williamson), 50-ish, our narrator; narrator; Duckling Donna (Olivia (Olivia Elease Hardy), a teen soloist soloist in her church choir; and the relentless midcareer hitmachine hitmachine Disco Donna (Alex Hairston). Teak Piegdon-Brainin A BAR OWNER, played by Keith Stevenson, considers a sign painted by Andy Warhol (Derek Chariton). got really challenging, Chariton Chariton recalls. One issue was purely cosmetic: He’d shaved his head for a role (in “Sweat” at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts), and it wasn’t clear that he’d have enough hair by the “Tomato” opening to approximate Warhol’s 1940s coiffure — puffy at the top, brushed back on the sides. He took vitamin vitamin supplements. Although Although the prospect of a wig was floated, his hair ultimately ultimately came through. The real difficulty lay deeper: “It’s hard to be someone someone else,” Chariton admits. All three Donnas have great stage presence and powerful, soaring voices, and the fluid way they interact and trade off storytelling duties duties is one of the production’s strengths. All recognizably Donna, they look sufficiently different so that each can anchor anchor us in time even when the narrative is jumping all over the place. The zany chronology wouldn’t be so puzzling if it served some apparent purpose. purpose. As it is, the book feels as though it’s being developed on the fly by panicked writers shouting into headsets backstage: backstage: “We forgot to mention the pastor’s sexual abuse! Oh, and can we shoehorn in an apology to the LGBTQ community for Donna’s homophobic homophobic comments of 1983?” Alas, this “apology” scene can’t be excused as a lastminute lastminute addition to “Summer.” “Summer.” It was mentioned in reviews reviews from the musical’s 2017 tryout at La Jolla Playhouse. Not only is an exculpatory soliloquy odd in a bio-musical, bio-musical, but this one comes across as a flat-out lie. Diva Donna informs us that she once told a concert audience “I mean, playing a character character is fun,” he goes on. “But to be someone who’s lived is like ... I want to do them justice but also I can’t judge them. And he was such an enigmatic enigmatic person, and people revere revere him, and I’ve had so many people come and be like, ‘I knew Andy Warhol.’ But so much of that is Andy Warhol the great ’60s Pop artist, and this play is not about that.” Chariton, who graduated from UCLA in 2013, had yet to be bom when Warhol died in 1987. He’d heard of Warhol, of course. “I’d seen the Marithat Marithat “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” because she was frustrated that the male fans’ voices were drowning out the women. women. To be fair, the musical presents other events in Donna’s life in nearly as haphazard haphazard and flippant a tone. We are repeatedly primed for dramatic conflict, only to watch the situation dismissed dismissed with a joke. Problem solved! Next song! When Duckling Donna calls her strict, churchgoing parents from Munich, Germany, Germany, to confess that she’s joined the touring cast of “Hair,” a showdown seems imminent. “Don’t eat the sausage!” her father growls. Beat. “It’s the wurst!” One of the themes of “Summer” is that Donna would have liked to be taken more seriously. Moments like this don’t help. But at least there are fabulous sets and costumes and choreography, right? Er. The set (by Robert Brill) is bare, a vast no man’s land — is it meant to represent represent the inside of a jukebox? — that is dominated by Sean Nieuwenhuis’ video projections, projections, which are often simply lyns,” he says. To learn more, he turned to Audible. He listened to Warhol’s autobiography. He watched interviews and documentaries on YouTube. He stmggled to decide how much of Warhol’s distinctive distinctive persona to incorporate incorporate into his performance. For example, “Every time somebody would ask Andy a question in an interview, he would go, ‘Uhhhh... Oh. Ahhhh...’ Ahhhh...’ and I was like, ‘Well, I can’t do that. That’ll be a three-hour show. And there’s a lot of‘uhhs’ written into the script, so I had to be like, ‘I’ll colored squares: Green. Now orange. The space dwarfs the ensemble, ensemble, almost all women, who tend to dress in drag (costumes by Paul Tazewell) when they’re backing a Donna. I can only surmise that this choice was made to evoke the mystery and androgyny androgyny of the New York disco scene. (Or does it have something to with Donna as a symbol of female empowerment? empowerment? Only a few men are in the cast; many male roles are played by women.) When you’re in the mood for feathers feathers and stilettos, it’s hard to be satisfied with doublebreasted doublebreasted suits and briefcases. briefcases. Even the Donnas’ outfits outfits seem subdued, in a limited limited range of colors. Although Although Sergio Trujillo’s choreography is funky and angular, there doesn’t seem to be quite enough of it. None of these cavils stopped me from standing up and cheering, with tears in my eyes, for “Last Dance.” “Summer” does succeed in evoking the triumph of its subject’s outsize talent and the poignancy of her loss, even though, heaven knows, it’s not the way it could be. make them human ‘uhhs’ and not Andy ‘uhhs.’ ” He didn’t feel he’d hit the right balance until midway into the run. “Initially I was just doing Andy,” he says. “I even was doing a different voice. And at this point I’m in my own voice. His body and my voice.” Even so, it’s live theater, so things continue to evolve. “It’s a different Andy every week,” he says.

Miccinrf inHira+orl h/ ""yy” AIDS group loses another housing lawsuit [Lawsuit, from Bl] Weinstein’s group has had at least six active lawsuits lawsuits against the city over the past year focusing on housing and planning decisions decisions in Hollywood. So far, judges have not been been receptive to its arguments. In June, a Superior Court judge upheld the city’s approval approval of the $ 1-billion Crossroads Crossroads Hollywood project, which will include a 26-story hotel tower and two mixeduse mixeduse residential towers — one 30 stories, the other 31. An appeals court later declined to overturn that ruling. In August, a three-judge panel rejected the nonprofit’s nonprofit’s bid to overturn the city’s approval of the Palladium Residences, which would provide 731 homes next to AIDS Healthcare’s offices. The state Supreme Court declined to reconsider that decision earlier this month. The Palladium project, which includes two 30-story towers, was approved by the council nearly four years ago. A representative of Crescent Crescent Heights, the project’s developer, said his clients are grateful that judges had concluded that they had “followed all the rules.” “We are very bothered that a frivolous lawsuit delayed delayed much needed housing, but look forward to getting under way,” said Steve Afriat, a spokesman for Crescent Heights. AIDS Healthcare has been pursuing separate lawsuits lawsuits against Palladium and Ricardo DeAratanha Los Angeles Times THE AIDS Healthcare Foundation is pursuing separate lawsuits to block projects including a 26-story residence on Amoeba Records’ Sunset Boulevard location. Stanley Saitowitz A RENDERING of the Palladium Residences, which was also targeted. three other projects in Hollywood: Hollywood: Crossroads Hollywood; Hollywood; Sunset and Gordon, a 299-unit residential tower that has been a longtime subject of litigation; and 6400 Sunset, a 26-story residential residential project planned on the site of the Amoeba Records Records building. In August, the group also filed a more sweeping lawsuit lawsuit targeting all those four of those projects. The nonprofit asked a judge to halt construction or other work on the residential residential towers on the grounds that they would accelerate the gentrification of Hollywood Hollywood and put the city in conflict conflict with state and federal laws aimed at protecting minorities minorities from housing discrimination. discrimination. “The influx of new, more affluent residents will have a ripple effect of displacement on the existing residents, who will see increased rents and increased property values values that will put pressure on existing, lower income residents residents who are already struggling struggling to make ends meet,” the lawsuit said. The nonprofit put a special special emphasis on the Crossroads Crossroads project, which would require the demolition of about 80 rent-controlled apartments. Although real estate company Harridge Development Group offered tenants a chance to move into the new project at roughly the same rents, some were alarmed to find the developer wanted them to sign agreements with nondisparagement clauses. Draper, the Superior Court judge, accused AIDS Healthcare of subjecting the city to “numerous” lawsuits, challenging the Palladium and Crossroads Hollywood even after judges ruled against the group on those projects. “California courts have made final decisions in two previous cases, both involving involving AHF and the city, both not in AHF’s favor,” the judge wrote. “AHF is attempting attempting to circumvent these previous decisions by repeatedly filing similar cases based on different legal legal theories.” City Atty. Mike Feuer welcomed welcomed the ruling, saying the judge had rejected the nonprofit’s nonprofit’s effort to “dictate land-use policy through litigation.” litigation.” And attorney Kyndra Casper, who represents the developer of Crossroads Hollywood, said her client had scored “two resounding victories against AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s questionable lawsuits.” “Basically, AHF tried to get a second bite at the apple, apple, and the court recognized recognized that they were simply filing the same lawsuit over again to try to get a different result,” she said. Susan Hunter, who volunteers volunteers with the Hollywood chapter of the L.A. Tenants Union, said she is not discouraged discouraged by the legal setbacks. setbacks. Hunter, who works for the anti-displacement group Housing is a Human Right, an affiliate of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Foundation, said she believes the lawsuits have helped shift the conversation around gentrification in her neighborhood. neighborhood. “It takes larger groups like AHF suing to change the narrative — the narrative that more housing is going to solve the housing crisis,” she said. Other housing organizations organizations had a different take, arguing arguing that the flurry of lawsuits lawsuits have in fact harmed Hollywood, by making it more difficult to build muchneeded muchneeded apartments and condominiums. Luke Klipp, education director director for the advocacy group Abundant Housing L.A., said the city needs more homes at all affordability affordability levels — affordable and market-rate. “Providing more housing, period, makes housing more affordable,” affordable,” he said. “That’s not to say only luxury housing will solve the affordability crisis,” Klipp added. “But getting in the way of building housing is having a negative impact on our ability to address our housing crisis, especially for those who are most vulnerable vulnerable or insecure.”",11/29/2019,"('would', 'accelerate', 'the')","('hollywood', 'hollywood', 'and')",[' The nonprofit asked a judge to halt construction or other work on the residential residential towers on the grounds that they would accelerate the gentrification of Hollywood Hollywood and put the city in conflict conflict with state and federal laws aimed at protecting minorities minorities from housing discrimination.'], The nonprofit asked a judge to halt construction or other work on the residential residential towers on the grounds that they would accelerate the gentrification of Hollywood Hollywood and put the city in conflict conflict with state and federal laws aimed at protecting minorities minorities from housing discrimination
1667,2423524542,"Napoleon a pioneer in plague spin Painter Antoine-Jean Gros turned French general’s ugly truths into feel-good fiction. CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT ART CRITIC Think President Trump is great at spinning plague propaganda? Try Napoleon Bonaparte instead. That’s a guy who had it down. Trump has the inarguable inarguable skills of a game-show host. That ratings-approved talent is now on entertaining display during the daily 5 o’clock follies, the disdained health-crisis version of those tragi-comic military press briefings held during the Vietnam Vietnam War. People tune in to watch the same way they slow to gape at a freeway crash. Napoleon had something else — the services of a firstrate firstrate artist, one who could paint a colossal and impressive impressive picture that would completely completely obliterate a troublesome troublesome story and transform it into something epic. Changing a damning negative negative into a flattering positive that gussied up Napoleon’s reputation, making him suitable suitable for military dictatorship, dictatorship, was a skill perfected by the talented Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835). His painting “Bonaparte Visiting the Victims Victims of the Plague at Jaffa, March 11,1799” launched his propaganda career. A monumental picture, more than 17 feet high and 23 feet wide, it has long hung on a giant wall in the Denon Wing at Paris’ Louvre. Most of the more than two dozen figures are larger than life — none more so than Napoleon himself. At 5 feet 2, he wasn’t a towering personage. Gros painted the extravagantly uniformed general, swathed in gilded sashes and crowned with a red-plumed hat, closer to 6 feet 8. The scene is a makeshift plague hospital in the Middle East. Strewn in the shadows across the foreground are the dead and dying, while Arabs at the left pass out bread, one turning back to witness the central scene.

For the student, Mario Solis, the sight of construction construction machinery hit like a cruel cruel insult. The community had long been promised a park, not a CHP station. He headed straight to the classroom classroom of a Chicano studies course at San Diego City College and sounded the alarm. Word spread and on that day, April 22,1970, locals collectively descended onto the land under the intersection, intersection, raised a flag and instituted instituted their own park — Chicano Chicano Park — without permission. permission. “The next step was really fast — everything started going just like that,” recalls Logan Heights native Josie Talamantez, snapping her fingers, in the 1988 documentary documentary “Chicano Park” by Red Bird Films. She was in the classroom when Solis — later later dubbed “the Paul Revere of Chicano Park” — just burst in. “We came down, came into the park, we made human chains around the tractors.” The students and community community members occupied the site for 12 days, clearing the ground and planting flowers and nopales until the city agreed to buy the land from the state and build a park.

The plague sufferer, with one hand raised above his head and the other pressed to his chest, evokes Michelangelo’s Michelangelo’s poignant sculpture sculpture of a “Dying Slave.” By contrast, in the painting’s warm, dusky hues, Napoleon is a florid pillar of unperturbed, unperturbed, even heroic strength. Amid a grim, foreign tableau of misery and woe, he radiates radiates light at center stage. It’s quite a scene. The painter has portrayed the soldier in a way that any contemporaneous contemporaneous viewer in historically historically Catholic France would recognize immediately immediately as a secular Christ. Set flamboyantly in the Holy Land, a miracle worker has arrived — just as one who, locus for mural artists, part of the renaissance of Chicano Chicano and resistance murals of the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s.

And now, “The community community has literally fused with that space.” On Saturday, Mexican Americans from across the U.S. Southwest were expected expected to descend upon Chicano Chicano Park once more for the annual Chicano Park Day. This year’s 50th observance was going to be the biggest ever, drawing bands, vendors, vendors, dance troupes and lowrider lowrider vehicles as well as the scents of BBQ wafting from the neighborhood streets. Then the pandemic But the coronavirus pandemic pandemic has halted the anniversary anniversary celebration. The festival will be postponed, postponed, according to a statement statement by the Chicano Park Steering Committee, although although a new date has not been set. The temporary cancellation cancellation has been a gut punch to the dedicated adherents of old-school Chicano culture who gather there: the fistraising fistraising Brown Berets, the danzantes, the cholos, the lowriders, the veteranos and veteranas who rep that distinct distinct barrio style of Pendlecenturies Pendlecenturies before, healed a desperate leper who came before him after delivery of the Sermon on the Mount. Napoleon’s superhuman power is offered as his prophylactic prophylactic against contracting contracting plague. The composition, not unlike the sermon’s lessons, is a morality play with the general as the star. It’s also a wild fiction — propaganda of the highest order. In Jaffa, the actual episode episode unfolded very differently. differently. Reputation at stake The 1799 plague in the ancient ancient coastal Mediterranean city — then in Syria but now in Israel, just south of modem modem Tel Aviv — threatened to permanently stain Napoleon’s Napoleon’s reputation.

It’s crushing.” The San Diego tradition, held on the weekend nearest to April 22, had increasingly drawn visitors from L.A., Orange Orange County and the Inland Empire. For now, artists and surviving activists from the era are still finding creative ways to honor the heritage of Chicano Park on its golden anniversary. The Steering Committee all week organized live online online screenings and history sessions. On Wednesday, the anniversary of the founding, founding, surviving members of the original band and their descendants gathered, wearing masks and adhering adhering to social distancing guidelines, to re-raise their founding flag. the siege of Egypt, the general’s general’s army was moving north to Syria to fight the Ottoman Turks. When the walled city of Jaffa fell to the French army, thousands of enemy soldiers were captured. Napoleon, unable to imprison or control such a multitude, ordered them all beheaded or shot. Some believe the wanton slaughter produced the unsanitary unsanitary conditions that triggered triggered the plague. Whatever the case, an epidemic raged. Napoleon’s own soldiers were hardly immune. With the help of local Armenian Armenian priests, a makeshift hospital to care for the sick was set up at Saint Nicholas Monastery. That’s the fantastically fantastically elaborate building with Moorish arches and “I can feel them here .people .people who were here with us for the takeover of this land, for Chicano Park,” said Tomasa “Tommie” Camarillo, the committee chair, in a video of Wednesday’s flag-raising. “I know they’re watching us with these big ole smiles, saying, ‘See? I knew you guys wouldn’t give up, you guys would stay there and finish what we started.’ And hopefully every generation will be the same.” Chicano Park’s 50-year celebration is crowded into an eventful anniversary year in resistance and environmental environmental justice history. On the same day that the park’s occupation began, Earth Day was declared, largely in response to the devastation of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. On Aug. 29, the Chicano Chicano Moratorium would end in the law-enforcement melee and shootings that led to the death of trailblazing L.A. Times journalist Ruben Salazar. Over time, Chicano Park was acknowledged for its historical importance by local, local, state and federal preservation preservation authorities, culmicrenellated culmicrenellated walls depicted in Gros’ painting. And that is where the scandal comes in. Dire events needed an artist to paper paper over them. It appears that not only was Napoleon not a miracle worker, he instead instead ordered fatal doses of opium be given to his own sick and dying soldiers. “It was thought it would be an act of charity to anticipate their death a few hours,” claimed his friend and memoirist, memoirist, the diplomat Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne. Bourrienne. The Turks were closing in on Jaffa and Napoleon had to hurry back to secure Cairo. Transporting sick soldiers was out of the question. Euthanasia Euthanasia was ordered.

The enormous canvas was unveiled at the Salon, a convenient national art occasion occasion that fell between Napoleon’s Napoleon’s May declaration of his emperorship and his December December coronation. It caused a stir. Rumors of Napoleon poisoning poisoning his own soldiers in Jaffa had been swirling, but Bourrienne’s explanatory memoir wouldn’t be published published for 20 more years. The imaginative propaganda painting told the story instead. instead. The rumors were shut down, the artist’s career secured. secured. Gros had been introduced introduced to Bonaparte in 1796 by Napoleon’s sweetheart, Josephine. He promptly painted a dashing portrait of the future emperor, one that flattered the sitter as surely as would the posthumous, full-length portrait of devastatingly devastatingly handsome young Charles Legrand, a 25-yearold 25-yearold French second lieutenant killed during Napoleon’s adventuring adventuring in Spain. Showing Legrand as a virtual golden boy, the painting, now in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, was commissioned as a memorial by the lad’s grieving parents. As Napoleon’s military chronicler, Gros could be formulaic. formulaic. When he won the 1807 commission to memorialize a gory battle fought to a bloody draw with the Imperial Russian Russian army in East Prussia, he divided up the canvas into zones similar to the Jaffa painting.

The early success the artist artist enjoyed eventually withered, withered, along with his patron’s dream of a continent under French dominion, destroyed after the calamity at Waterloo. Waterloo. Gros grew despondent. He died of suicide, drowning himself in the Seine in 1835. Yet a peculiar last hurrah happened a dozen years before before his death. Gros’ student, the prodigy Auguste-Hyacinthe Auguste-Hyacinthe Debay, painted a smaller, brighter, less grim easel-copy of the giant Jaffa painting, now in the collection collection of Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. Debay was just 19, bom the year the original was painted, but the timing of the copy was telling: Napoleon Napoleon had recently died, and Bourrienne’s damning memoir memoir had finally just been published. published. The eyewitness book exposed the lie of the plagueproof plagueproof miracle at Jaffa. It didn’t matter. By then, Gros’ triumphant propaganda propaganda painting was no longer a mere narrative of far-off historical historical events. As Victor Hugo would put it in “Les Miserables,” fiction had power over fact, scripted myth over reality: “A great man had to disappear in order order that a great century be bom.” Debay’s burnished picture, painted for his mentor, mentor, underscored it. Gros was so good at what he did that after Napoleon was dead and buried, he was awarded an aristocratic title by the King of France. Antoine-Jean Antoine-Jean Gros became Baron Gros. Donald Tmmp, on the other hand, had to fabricate his own aristocratic name. “John Baron” was his madeup madeup publicist, a go-to alias he used in the 1980s when he telephoned reporters to tout himself. Disinformation would get the failing real estate developer’s developer’s name printed breathlessly breathlessly in the tabloids, propaganda propaganda that later begat the scripted reality of “The Apprentice.” Apprentice.” A puffy, gilded fiction fiction helped lay the groundwork groundwork for a presidency of alternative alternative facts, floundering through a time of actual plague. Bodega, for example, had to close and change locations because of a rent increase. “We’ve seen a lot of residents be kicked out or businesses closed because rent was raised,” Lopez-Chavez said. The formation of Chicano Chicano Park also is considered a precursor to many of the community-led actions over green space and garden land in Latino urban centers that followed. Yvette LopezLedesma, LopezLedesma, an L.A. native, experienced experienced planner and advocate advocate for green space in the San Fernando Valley, spent much of her childhood and teen years in San Diego County, where her parents still live.

Hill calls the skill “the biggest thing in my game.” That ability will be tested immediately as the rookie wide receiver attempts to navigate a less-than-traditional less-than-traditional route to the start of an NFL career. First, he had to wait until the third day, the seventh round and the 220th overall pick in April, for the Chargers Chargers to draft him. There were 33 receivers selected before Hill, and that’s not counting Antonio Gibson, who mostly played wide receiver at Memphis but was drafted by Washington Washington primarily to be a running back. “It was really hard, seeing other receivers go before you,” Hill said. “But I got my name called, and that’s the most important thing.” Now, Hill is part of a firstyear firstyear class of players facing the most uphill, against-thewind against-thewind challenge to survive in the NFL. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, rookies rookies across the league missed an offseason of critical onfield onfield work. Rookies report to training camp Tuesday, with veterans scheduled to arrive July 28. In the spring, the Chargers Chargers recruited Austin Ekeler, their No. 1 running back and one of the NFL’s top underdog underdog stories, to address the rookies about the importance importance of mastering the playbook. playbook. “If you’re a great athlete and you can do amazing things, that’s great,” Ekeler said. “But if you can’t be trusted on the field to protect protect the team, the ball, you’re not going to see much playing time.” In 2017, Ekeler made the Chargers late in the preseason preseason as an undrafted longshot longshot out of tiny Western State in Colorado. He didn’t clinch a roster spot until the fourth exhibition. Whitworth feels fortunate after virus ‘It happens quickly,’ Rams offensive lineman says after his family was infected. By Gary Klein As NFL teams prepare to open training camps amid a COVID-19 pandemic, Rams offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth can offer firsthand firsthand experience about the disease. Whitworth, his wife, Melissa, Melissa, their four children, their live-in nanny and Melissa’s Melissa’s parents tested positive positive for the novel coronavirus coronavirus and experienced symptoms this summer. Melissa’s Melissa’s father was hospitalized hospitalized but is recovering. “There was about 72 hours there where we didn’t know if we would see him again,” Melissa said of her father father during a Tuesday videoconference videoconference with reporters. Whitworth, 38, is the second second known Rams player to have tested positive. Center Brian Allen did so during the spring. The Whitworths said their family took precautions precautions such as social distancing distancing and wearing masks. “Just trying to be as smart as we could with the process,” said Andrew, who revealed during a conference conference call with reporters last week that his family had been exposed to the virus. “The moral of the story is that even when you look at the football season and everything we’re trying to do just across the country.... It’s so contagious that it happens happens quickly,” Andrew said. Said Melissa: “Our main message would be you just never know where you’re going going to pick it up.

Despite his production with the Buckeyes, Hill was buried in one of the deepest wide receiver draft classes in recent memory. His 4.6-second 4.6-second speed in the 40-yard dash was an oft-repeated knock. “He’s super smart and instinctive instinctive and has a great feel for how to get open, which a lot of inside receivers need to have,” Chargers general manager Tom Telesco said. “Excellent hands.” Before Hill was drafted, Las Vegas and Philadelphia each took three wide receivers, receivers, and seven other teams selected two players at the position. Even the Chargers picked up Virginia receiver Joe Reed two rounds before adding Hill. In fact, he was no better than the third wide receiver named K. J. to be taken, coming coming after KJ Hamler (second round, Denver) and K. J. Osborn Osborn (fifth round, Minnesota) Minnesota) . Still, the Chargers were encouraged by what they were able to add, particularly particularly so late in the draft. “He’s a very crafty routerunner,” routerunner,” offensive coordinator coordinator Shane Steichen said. “You can get matchups inside inside with him on linebackers. linebackers.

The Rams announced Tuesday that all season tickets tickets will be deferred to the 2021 season and that stadium stadium capacity for games this season, if fans are allowed, would be about 15,000.

CHARGERS ROOKIES Chargers rookies report Tuesday for training camp with the hope of finally getting a chance to show their skills on the field. Because of the pandemic, the offseason program has been virtual. The draft prospects: Justin Herbert, QB, first round: In their ideal world, the Chargers could let the young quarterback learn from the sidelines all season. That would mean veteran Tyrod Taylor is having success, and so is the team. Kenneth Murray Jr., LB, first round: He immediately makes the Chargers more athletic and versatile at linebacker and is expected to need little time to make an impact. Joshua Kelley, RB, fourth round: Led by starter Austin Ekeler, the Chargers will attempt to develop a reliable rotation rotation at running back, meaning Kelley will be given every available opportunity to earn playing time. Joe Reed, WR, fifth round: Ekeler has developed into one of the NFL’s most versatile offensive weapons, something the Chargers also would love to do with Reed. Alohi Gilman, S, sixth round: The Chargers’ athletic and deep secondary received another boost with the addition of Gilman, who is expected to be a key contributor on special teams, much like Drue Tranquill, his former Notre Dame teammate, was last season.

Other than Allen and Williams, no Chargers wide receiver reached the ority status to purchase individual individual tickets to games this season in a process that has not been announced. With the players union and NFL appearing to be near an agreement to cancel preseason games, the first game at the $5-billion stadium stadium would be the Rams’ Sept. 13 season opener against the Dallas Cowboys on “Sunday Night Football.” Season-ticket holders opting out for 2020 can request request a refund or apply money money already paid to 2021 tickets. tickets. Regardless, they will keep their seats for the 2021 season at the same price, the Rams said.

He didn’t run extremely extremely fast, but I like the fact that he plays fast. All he does is make plays when he’s on the football field.” Clark was eventually discharged discharged and is still dealing with the aftermath, which includes a bad cough. But the Whitworths consider themselves fortunate. “I just cannot imagine what people have been through that have lost their loved ones that way,” Melissa Melissa said of not being able to be with COVID-19 patients at the hospital. “My dad was there for a week and it felt like an eternity.” In recounting their experience, experience, the Whitworths said tracing the exact source of their exposure remains elusive. elusive. “In some ways you chase ghosts,” Andrew said. “Being “Being out in the public in any way, you’re presenting an opportunity for that to happen. happen. ...

By Tania Ganguli ORLANDO, Fla. — Before Before the Lakers started practice practice Saturday on Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports campus, LeBron James and Anthony Davis got a peek at the arena where they would be playing games. They saw the video screens surrounding the court, where it’s possible virtual virtual fans will be shown during during a game. They saw the bench area where seats will be spaced apart, nothing like the knee-to-knee setup on a normal NBA bench. The court reads Black Lives Matter Matter just in front of a plexiglass plexiglass box that encloses the scorer’s table. “I think it’s pretty cool how they’ll have the big monitors, where you can have your family, friends, fans, whoever, kind of be in the arena,” Davis said. “I think that’s a pretty dope idea. I know they’re still trying trying to figure out some things as far as lighting and sound and stuff. But I think the whole concept of it is pretty dope.” The Lakers are a little more than a week away from their first game and will begin begin scrimmaging this week. They’ll have a chance to see where they are in their quest to tune up for the playoffs. They’ll find out how their new pieces are meshing. And they’ll experience something something no basketball player before them has experienced. experienced. On Monday they became a little more whole as Markieff Markieff Morris traveled to Orlando Orlando to rejoin the team, arriving arriving in the evening. “First, we gotta get him in and cleared,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Tuesday afternoon. “That’s the biggest biggest thing. And Markieff Morris has cleared the protocol protocol in L.A.... So it will be a couple days before he arrives that we’ll be able to see him on the court.” The Lakers have not disclosed disclosed why Morris was delayed delayed in rejoining his team. His twin, Marcus, was at CLIPPERS REPORT Morris practices, Beverley departs By Andrew Greif Coach Doc Rivers wouldn’t say which Clippers will play Wednesday during his team’s first scrimmage ahead of the NBAs restart. But the story Tuesday was more about the player who was, at last, on the court. Marcus Morris, the starting forward since his acquisition from the New York Knicks in February, participated in what was believed believed to be his first practice since arriving at the Disney World campus near Orlando, Orlando, Fla. Morris did not travel to the NBA bubble with the team July 8 and was not known to be on campus until he stepped on the practice practice floor Tuesday morning. The addition of the 6foot-8 6foot-8 Morris, who has averaged averaged 9.5 points on 38% shooting in 12 games with the Clippers, moved the team’s 15-man roster closer to full strength, but key absences absences remain. Starting center center Ivica Zubac and reserve guard Landry Shamet — neither of whom traveled to Orlando with the team nearly two weeks ago — were not seen at practice Tuesday, Tuesday, which was partially open to reporters. On Sunday, Sunday, Shamet posted a photo of himself on Instagram with the caption, “Quarantine almost almost over.” Zubac, meanwhile, meanwhile, posted three hourglass hourglass emojis Tuesday. Backup center Montrezl Harrell left Orlando on Friday Friday because of an emergency emergency family matter related to his grandmother. And on Tuesday, guard Patrick Beverley departed the NBAs campus to take care of what was described as an “emergency family matter,” according to a person person with knowledge of the situation. Anyone who leaves the NBAs campus can reenter only after spendpractice spendpractice with the Clippers on Tuesday — the first practice practice the Clippers had open to reporters since arriving in the bubble. Marcus Morris did not travel with the team July 8 and was not confirmed to be on campus in Orlando until Tuesday. Players who arrive late to the bubble must test negative negative for the coronavirus in the seven days before their arrival with tests occurring every other day and in the two days immediately before the trip. If they fly privately or drive, they must pass two PCR tests for the virus at least 24 hours apart and one rapid test. “And then obviously we’re gonna be smart about building him up at the right pace,” Vogel said of Markieff. “We don’t want him to be injured. injured. He’s obviously been out and not been with the team for a while.” They’d been taking a similar similar view with their new additions additions who did fly with them to Orlando — J.R. Smith and Dion Waiters. At one point during the prepractice stretches, Waiters Waiters stood in one comer of the convention center ballroom that had become their practice practice court and danced, sang and rapped along to the music music accompanying their movements. On the other comer of the room, Smith sat near James as James got stretched by his longtime trainer Mike Mancias. “I think we’re pretty close,” Davis said, when asked how far the team is from where it wants to be when games begin to count. “There’s still some things that we want to work on. We were one of the worst teams in transition [defensively], so we’ve been going over that a ton, watching film on that a ton. But I think everybody came back in shape. You could tell guys have been working during the break. Now it’s all about putting it all back together.” Their routines are getting getting a little bit more familiar. While some teams arrange a film study area on their practice practice courts, the Lakers typically typically watch film in their meeting rooms to have some separation. They’ll be allowed, too, to watch games of other teams in person by way of socially distanced seats. ing between four and 10 days in quarantine. The timing not only rules out Beverley for the team’s first two scrimmages, against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday and the Washington Wizards on Saturday, Saturday, but also puts into question his availability for the team’s first seeding game July 30 against the Lakers. The playoffs begin Aug. 17. “Sometimes the real-life stuff comes into play and you have to adjust,” Rivers said on a videoconference call with reporters.

1379,2466328577,"AN APPRECIATION Reddy’s roar music to misfit ears I was 7, gay and an outcast. The women in her hit songs offered me solace. By Charles Isherwood Helen Reddy, the Australian-bom Australian-bom pop singer who died on Tuesday in Los Angeles at the age of 78, has justly been celebrated and mourned for her groundbreaking, then nigh-radical hit “I Am Woman,” Woman,” which reached the top of the charts late in 1972. True, hearing it now, it seems almost quaint in its bald polemicism — if you can describe as polemicism the rather mild notion that a woman, or rather all women, are as strong, powerful and ready to “roar” as men. Women Women of the era naturally propelled propelled the song to popularity, coming as it did when the Equal Rights Amendment was being debated, and women women would begin fighting the backlash against feminism that would bring the likes of Phyllis Schlafly and Marabel Morgan (she of the “wrap yourself in cellophane to keep the man interested” book “The Total Woman”) into the cultural conversation. But I am sure there was another audience that cherished cherished Reddy and her string of pop hits at the time. This would be young gay men, or maybe proto-gay men: prepubescent, prepubescent, prehormonal, but still innately and acutely aware that they were somehow somehow destined, if they didn’t find their own way to “roar” their truth, or at least whisper it to sympathetic ears, to being being relegated to the margins of society. I was about 7 when “I Am Woman” became a sensation, and I was certainly a part of this proto-gay demographic. I was already learning that I wasn’t what was considered normal: All my friends were girls, and my favorite pastime was dressing up in women’s clothes. When my grandmothers grandmothers visited, I would beg them to let me clomp around in their high heels, which they sweetly if probably rather worriedly indulged. When “I Am Woman” came on the radio in our station station wagon, I furtively turned up the volume, memorized She’s gotta have it all, or does she? [‘Version,’ from El] with equal ease. (That Blank wrote a few episodes of Netflix’s Netflix’s recent “She’s Gotta Have It” series spinoff only reinforces the connection.) But Radha is older, wearier wearier and more beaten down than Nola, and she takes a while longer to take ownership ownership of her story. Watching her figure out exactly how to do it — as she makes her way around New York with a determined determined stride and (invariably) (invariably) a diet smoothie — is the film’s purpose and pleasure. That bedroom will continue continue to play a part: It’s where Radha keeps an old playwriting trophy, now a discouraging reminder of unrealized promise, as well as a photo of her recently deceased mother, a visual artist. It’s also where Radha stays up late honing her craft, whether that’s rapping in front of a mirror or hammering hammering away at the play she’s been writing for years. Nola juggled three men; Radha moves among three artistic spaces, each one significant. significant. The first is the classroom classroom where she teaches drama to a bunch of highspirited highspirited high schoolers, steering them through the process of writing and producing producing their own play. Embodied Embodied by a group of irrepressible irrepressible young actors (Haskiri (Haskiri Velazquez, Imani Lewis, Antonio Ortiz and TJ Atoms), Atoms), her students serve every possible narrative function: They’re her comic relief, support squad and occasional occasional smack upside the head. Given her setbacks and failures, does Radha even have the right to call herself an artist, let alone rear a younger generation of them? Of course she does, even if the world doesn’t always agree. Radha’s second space is the rarefied world of New York theater, which threw her a bone years ago but now has little use for her talents — not even amid a greater push for diversity, which mostly results results in bankable-sounding crap like an all-female revival Herb Ball NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images BLUES MUSICIAN B.B. King performs with Helen Reddy on NBC’s “The Helen Reddy Show” in 1973. every word and sang it to myself myself whenever I could. Privately, Privately, of course: It wouldn’t do to for a boy to belt it on the playground in the virtually all-white suburban community community in then-nascent Silicon Valley where I grew up. First obsession But my adoration of Reddy—she was my first pop music obsession — didn’t stop with her biggest hit. The first album I ever bought with my own money, allowance saved up for weeks, was “Long Hard Climb.” I still remember remember gazing with an inward inward thrill at its pastel foldout foldout jacket. It was released in 1973, and two of its songs became became hits: “Delta Dawn” and “Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress).” Those were really the only songs I listened to, in the way kids (and not just kids) fixate on songs and play them repeatedly, repeatedly, until the vinyl fairly groans with boredom. And it’s only now, long after I stopped listening to Reddy, that I realized that these songs, too, along with her later later hit “Angie Baby,” contained contained a dark subtext — well, it wasn’t so subtextual if you carefully parsed the lyrics, which I didn’t have the psychological psychological or sociological acuity to do at the time — about the corrosive dangers of being a social outcast. Consider Delta Dawn, the doomed and apparently deranged deranged heroine of the title. of “12 Angry Men.” That highconcept highconcept production is the brainchild, if that’s the word, of a condescending theater producer named J. Whitman (Tony winner Reed Bimey, giving a master class in smarm). He takes one look at Radha’s long-gestating play, a realistic portrait of a Black couple living in a fastgentrifying fastgentrifying Harlem, and suggests suggests a number of alterations alterations to make it more accessible accessible to a white audience. The bitter irony of that development — the gentrification gentrification of a play about gentrification! gentrification! — is almost too on the nose. But it does allow Blank to land some delicious blows, physical as well as satirical, satirical, against the many, many Whitmans (white men?) in her field. It’s all frustrating frustrating enough to drive Radha back into the arms of an old musical passion, as she considers abandoning theater and becoming a rapper rapper instead. In this third space, she hopes to funnel her disappointments into free-flowing beats and rhymes, and also to feel authentically grounded, for a change, in a strong community community of Black artists. The reality turns out to be a lot more complicated — and also a lot funnier and sadder. Radha’s plunge into the hip-hop world leads her all over New York, from a Bronx boxing ring where female rappers go ferociously headto-head headto-head to a Brooklyn club where, despite her skills, she is confronted once more with the sting of failure. It’s there too that she begins recording a mixtape with a gruff but sensitive DJ (Oswin Benjamin) Benjamin) , whose interest in her, personal as well as professional, professional, is one of the script’s generally effective concessions concessions to romantic-comedy formula. Another is Radha’s talent agent and closest confidant, confidant, Archie (a winning Peter Peter Kim), who is a shrewd, affectionate affectionate riff on the gay best friend trope and a welcome fount of tough love. Eager to get Radha’s play “All the folks around Brownsville say she’s crazy,” we leam, as she “walks downtown downtown with a suitcase in her hand, looking for a mysterious mysterious dark-haired man” — the man “of low degree” who apparently apparently seduced and abandoned abandoned her. A sort of AM-radio Blanche DuBois, poor Dawn was, viewed from a 21st century century perspective, a victim of the cruel sexual mores that still treated a “fallen” woman as a pariah, if not a madwoman, madwoman, at least in places like Brownsville. “Ruby Red Dress” was a very similar figure (clearly Reddy’s producers knew a good niche when they saw it). Like DD, Ruby also wanders around town (unnamed), “talkin’ to herself” and fleeing at the approach of others.

The sly achievement of “The Forty-Year-Old Version” Version” is to turn a critical eye on the very idea of success, and to ponder exactly what level of compromise is acceptable acceptable to secure it. It pains Radha to see her work diluted diluted and sensationalized for the clucking patrons and self-appointed gatekeepers of the theater world. But as the movie makes clear, the ostensibly more authentic, ground-level world of hiphop hiphop isn’t necessarily a better fit for Radha, whose artistic identity turns out to be an in“leave in“leave me alone” surely struck a strong chord.) But pop music music has an insidious way of igniting igniting self-discovery even when it is unrecognized. It also has the power to bring solace and understanding. As a boy who was already well aware that I was not going going to be prom king, and was probably already being picked last for any and all team sports, I am sure that somewhere in my confused psyche Reddy’s doomed heroines heroines provided a kind of perverse perverse comfort. If they were special enough for Helen to be singing about them, there might be hope for me. Perhaps the darkest of the mad heroines of Reddy’s hit parade was the young woman called “Angie Baby,” whose story speaks specifically to the way I, and gay men of many eras, escaped from the casual (and not) brutalities of the world through the mediums mediums of music and movies, where fantasy could flood the mind — and take the place of absent friends. “You live your life in the song you hear / On the rock and roll radio,” run the opening opening lines. “And when a young girl doesn’t have any friends / That’s a really nice place to go.” I hear you, Angie! Poor Angie (age unknown) unknown) is haunted by “lovers” who appear in her room each night, and has to be taken out of school.

Blank the filmmaker has her own rich trove of influences, influences, Lee chief among them, though she has also acknowledged acknowledged other New York directors, including Woody Allen, John Cassavetes and Sidney Lumet.

The logline for “The Forty-Year-Old Version” — struggling playwright seeks to reinvent herself as rap artist — is enough to provoke, provoke, if not an eye roll, then could relate — Angie is obviously obviously mentally disturbed and, like Delta Dawn and Ruby Red Dress, her sisters in pariah-hood, pariah-hood, victimized by a “neighbor boy / With evil on his mind.” But, in contrast to Reddy’s Reddy’s other macabre heroines, Angie has her revenge. The boy with evil on his mind somehow (I think) is subsumed subsumed into the music on Angie’s Angie’s radio, becoming her “secret “secret lover” even as the headlines headlines tell of a boy who “disappeared.” “disappeared.” Score one for the crazy ladies. I liked some of Reddy’s more benign songs too, such as “Peaceful” and “Keep on Singing.” But looking back, I suspect, even more than “I Am Woman,” my affection for which inadvertently affirmed what we would now call my innate innate recognition of gender fluidity, it was the grim but melodically irresistible stories stories of Reddy’s outcast women women that really sank somewhere somewhere into my young heart and brought a dark but perhaps perhaps necessary comfort. If freaks like them could become the stars of pop songs, perhaps there was hope for even a kid like me. Charles Isherwood is a theater and arts critic who has written for publications including the Advocate, Variety, the Times of London and the New York Times. at least a wearying preconception preconception of how the movie will end: in the spotlight, of course, where the two poles of Radha’s art will fight each other to the death, cancel each other out or somehow triumphantly converge. But Blank skirts inspirationalunderdog inspirationalunderdog cliches as deftly as she skewers the trappings of racial and cultural privilege. And she makes clear that wherever Radha ends up — whether she successfully leaps through the culture’s designated hoops or gives up being an artist altogether — is ultimately less meaningful meaningful than the complex, irreducible irreducible reality of who she is. Radha may struggle to project authenticity in her writing, but nothing we see of her ever seems less than authentic. authentic. Her talent for rapping rapping wells up from a palpably real place, but so does her knack for self-deflating humor; humor; she effortlessly elicits laughs, sometimes to defuse tension and sometimes to stifle her own tears. But where does authenticity end and artifice begin? The character character may be an on-screen projection of Blank’s own foibles, aspirations and gifts, but that doesn’t make her an exacting self-portrait. There are details here — notably the head scarf she wears in almost every scene — that are pointedly left unexplained, unexplained, both as to their significance significance and their origin. It would be a mistake, in other words, to see “The Forty-Year-Old Version” purely as a soul-baring autobiographical autobiographical exercise. Success Success doesn’t come easily to Radha, but Blank has already already enjoyed a well-earned measure of it off-screen: Netflix Netflix acquired her film at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, Festival, where Blank walked away with a directing prize. A movie that makes strides for Black female artists artists by critiquing the very obstacles obstacles they face? That’s the kind of uplift that might elicit Radha’s skepticism and yours, which doesn’t make it ring any less true. Trying to help movie theaters Film studios, directors and exhibitors ask the federal government to fund cinemas. By Ryan Faughnder After more than six months of struggles amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Hollywood Hollywood issued a dire message about the state of the movie theater industry — the nation’s nation’s cinemas “may not survive” survive” without help. Groups representing movie studios, theater owners owners and directors on Wednesday Wednesday called on Washington lawmakers to provide “specific “specific relief” for film exhibitors, saying that nearly 70% of small and midsized theater companies would be forced to declare bankruptcy or go out of businesses without government government assistance. Dozens of famous filmmakers, filmmakers, including Judd Apatow, Apatow, James Cameron, Greta Gerwig, Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, Wes Anderson, Clint Eastwood and Ang Lee, signed a letter calling on the federal government to provide provide support for the industry, which remains shuttered in much of the country. The National Assn, of Theatre Owners (NATO), the Washington-based organization organization that stumps for exhibitors, sent the letter, addressed addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (RKy.), (RKy.), Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield). (R-Bakersfield). The Motion Picture Assn., the lobby representing the major film studios, joined NATO in signing the letter, as did the Directors Guild of America. “Absent a solution designed designed for their circumstances, circumstances, theaters may not survive the impact of the pandemic,” pandemic,” the industry groups said in the letter. “Cinemas are an essential industry that represent the best that American talent and creativity creativity have to offer. But now we fear for their future.” Movie theaters slowly began began to reopen across the country in anticipation of Nolan’s “Tenet” in the U. S. before before Labor Day weekend. But after “Tenet” reported modest modest domestic box office results, results, studios including Walt Disney Co. and Universal Pictures Pictures have continued to delay big movies, fearing not enough cinemas are open to support expensive blockbusters, blockbusters, and too few moviegoers moviegoers are ready to return. Last week, Disney moved multiple titles including “Black Widow” Widow” and Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” to later dates. Warner Bros, shifted “Wonder Woman 1984” from October to Christmas. Theaters remain closed in markets representing roughly roughly 30% of annual box office sales, including Los Angeles County and New York, the nation’s nation’s two biggest locales for filmgoing. Neither jurisdiction jurisdiction has said when theaters may be able to return. That has caused problems for theater theater chains that need new movies to operate profitably. Some have reduced hours to stem losses. According to the industry groups, 93% of exhibitors saw their revenue plummet 75% or more in the second quarter, quarter, compared with the same period of time last year. In the U.S., the theater industry employs employs 150,000 people, many of whom are part time and hourly. If the status quo continues, continues, two-thirds of those jobs could vanish, the groups warned. “Our country cannot afford to lose the social, economic, economic, and cultural value that theaters provide,” the letter said. The industry leaders called on the elected officials to allocate unspent funds from the CARES Act, the stimulus package President Trump signed into law in March, to programs designed for industries including movie movie theaters. They also suggesting enacting enacting measures such as the RESTART Act, a congressional congressional bill that would help venues and other businesses by extending and bolstering the Paycheck Protection Program.

694,2466321100,"HOW TO LISTEN I ’m standing up here as an artist representing the younger generation, and one who has been doubly affronted,” Olga Neuwirth announced in a speech at a mass demonstration demonstration in Vienna 20 years ago. She had one thing to say to a new far-right government that expressed support for neither a ministry of women nor one of arts: “I will not be yodeled out of existence.” She hasn’t been. Neuwirth, bom in Graz, Austria, in 1968, has become one of Europe’s most established, but not establishment, establishment, composers. Her affront to the Austrian obsession with homeland, “Masaot/Clocks Without Without Hands,” was written for the storied, old-world Vienna Philharmonic. Philharmonic. Last December the premiere of her outrage to operatic operatic tradition, “Orlando,” became became the first opera by a woman in the fabled 150-year history of the Vienna State Opera, receiving receiving mainstream international press attention. Her New York Philharmonic commission that John Adams was to have conducted conducted in May got postponed because of the pandemic. She was to have been featured by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Ojai Music Festival in June. Yodelers, though, still yodel, and Neuwirth’s affronts multiply — musical, racial, sexual, gender or any other form of intolerance — along with her continued stand against Austrian patriarchy. patriarchy. She does so as an Americophile Americophile who, like a latter-day Whitman, is a large composer and contains multitudes. She counts as her inspirations Miles Davis (as a teenager she had wanted to be a jazz tmmpeter until she broke her jaw and couldn’t play anymore), blaxploitation blaxploitation films, Adams (with whom she studied), the antiAdams antiAdams Pierre Boulez (who was one of her early champions and whom she called a mensch) and the Austrian novelist, playwright and Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek. Most of all, Neuwirth’s is the raised voice of the outsider. A Jew, a woman, a radical and a polymath from a place where all raise suspicions, she is a seeker of identity in all its mysterious, often conflicting cultural aspects. And it is the seeking, not the knowing, that makes her work especially important. Identity politics motivates protest and discord. As always, all sides, we fight for the right to be what we are. But unraveling our essence, knowing in the deepest and most mysterious crevices of our being, who we are and how we came to be that way, is what the yodelers most easily drown out in false certainty. For all her potent, overt advocacy, Neuwirth to a unique degree probes into those uncomfortable uncomfortable places of the unknown. In Neuwirth’s operas, which have gained the most attention, identity identity is neither easily understood nor automatically conferred. It must be earned. Her striking adaptation of David Lynch’s film “Lost Highway” Highway” adds yet another surreal dimension of uncertainty about our perceptions of who’s who.

He compares grammatical sentences sentences to prison sentences, cancer in a human body to the gentrification of Oakland, Oakland, Freddy Krueger to the American criminal justice system. Sometimes you don’t think he’ll pull it off, and then he does. “Still.,” commissioned as a response to the killing of George Floyd in May, is inevitably inevitably full of rage. It’s also full of hope. Revealing much more might reveal too much of a show that runs less than an hour, but suffice it to say that a live audience would probably laugh a lot during Johnson’s performance. He has a way of lightening a tense moment with a joke. But there’s no audience. The camera keeps reminding us of its absence, panning across the empty seats.

The startling startling scenes on the Vienna State Opera stage include 1960s advocacy advocacy of civil rights and sexual freedom, a transgender present and a post-Trump sci-fi future that evolves toward spirituality rather than dystopia. The opera world has reacted with predictable horror and told this woman who has gone too far to cut, cut, cut. Timorous, irrelevant irrelevant American opera companies won’t touch the stuff.

There’s a fascinating video of an excitable Leonard Bernstein rehearsing the Mahler that was an inspiration for Neuwirth.

The composition was delayed, but Neuwirth couldn’t escape the ghost of Mahler, who became intertwined with the ghost of a grandfather she never knew. He was a man of many homelands, a wandering Eastern European Jew among the intersecting nationalities and cultures along the Danube. To know herself, she sought to find the unfindable in him, and she stumbled into the elusiveness of memory (the source for confusion in “Lost Highway”) and the elusiveness of time (the source for confusion in “Orlando”).

For the susceptible, this is a moment of instant hypnosis, although even that is a deception. deception. The orchestra joins in for a crescendo that crashing into a deafening chord. The alarm has sounded. The orchestra becomes a river of sound, lapping waves of kaleidoscopic instrumental colors. In the seemingly far distance distance come snatches of Klezmer melodies. Then clocks tick. Three metronomes set at different different times rhythmically collide, and in a marvelous stroke the orchestra tick-tocks in its own Einsteinian universe, relativity unwinding. Clocks, Klezmer and the river of time flow on and on, changing, evolving, but going nowhere. Grandfather’s travails — masa’ot means travel in Hebrew — bring sobering thoughts of a Jew in what would become Hitler’s Austria. Neuwirth researched researched his life and those like him in archives. Studied his pictures. His lack of belonging to place resonates with her own complicated feelings about belonging. belonging. But he remains out of reach. Even belonging is relative. The orchestral writing in “Masaot” takes advantage of the sheer beauty of the Vienna Philharmonic. Philharmonic. But for Neuwirth, beauty can be yet another weapon weapon of subversion. Those elusive Klezmer tunes entice just out of reach, reminding us of Mahler, who had to convert to Catholicism Catholicism to become music director of the Vienna Philharmonic. They’re a long-hidden part of the history of an orchestra that didn’t accept its first female musician until 1997 and that didn’t acknowledge its complicity complicity with Nazi Germany until 2013. In Neuwirth’s nuanced “Masaot,” identity then becomes understood as a quest, which means every orchestra and every conductor brings something radically different to the table. It was the British Harding who gave the premiere with the Vienna Vienna Philharmonic. Could it be that Neuwirth touched an identity nerve? An avid pilot, Harding has embraced his inner “masaot,” his compulsion for travel, announcing that he will take time off from conducting to fly for Air France (clocks without hands presumably assuring on-time arrival). The delicious irony is that Neuwirth, herself, doesn’t fly. But in “Masaot,” we all fly with Olga. No yodeling, please.

By David Zahniser and Emily Alpert Reyes The sleek new residential tower called Arq is billed as luxury living for L.A.’s creative creative set, with commanding views and studio apartments apartments for $3,121 per month. Located at the edge of South Los Angeles, the 30story 30story high-rise is unlike any other residential building in that part of the city, looming over its neighbors. It’s part of the Cumulus District, a development slated to house restaurants, a Whole Foods supermarket and more than 1,200 apartments. Cumulus is the type of massive high-end development development that’s typical for downtown, Hollywood or Century City. In L.A.’s West Adams neighborhood, which has struggled for decades decades to attract grocers and retailers, the project is viewed as transformational. No one at City Hall was more essential to getting the project approved than Councilman Herb Wesson, who represents the area and is now running for county supervisor. supervisor. Wesson pushed for the site to be rezoned, eliminating eliminating the property’s 45-foot height limit, and voted to remove remove language aimed at ensuring ensuring the project would offer offer city-regulated affordable housing. Now, with leasing activities activities just getting under way, the project has resurrected debate over whether Cumulus Cumulus represents a resurgence for neighborhoods south of the 10 Freeway or the gentrification of one of Los Angeles’ historically black neighborhoods, driving out people with limited means. Activist Damien Goodmon, Goodmon, who challenged the project without success in 2016, said he was stunned to learn that Arq’s two-bedroom two-bedroom apartments were recently recently listed for $5,292 per month and up. “Those are Beverly Hills prices in South L.A.,” he said. “I’m not going to lie. It scares me.” Goodmon said the city should have limited the project project to eight stories and incorporated incorporated low-income affordable affordable housing to reflect the incomes of the surrounding surrounding neighborhood. Wesson, in turn, has said he simply followed the wishes of the community, which was “overwhelmingly” in favor of Cumulus, including the tower. In 2016, the neighbors wanted open space and a supermarket on the site, not more affordable housing, Wesson and an aide said earlier earlier this year. “The community felt that [See Cumulus, B2] Cases surge in the Southland Increases in L.A. and other areas could partly be due to more COVID-19 testing, bs L.A. camping law up for vote Homeless advocates are fighting city’s plan to allow the removal of camps.

GEORGE SKELTON IN SACRAMENTO California voters are being asked again whether they believe affirmative action based on race, ethnicity ethnicity and gender is necessary to combat discrimination — or is itself discriminatory. Supporters of Proposition Proposition 16 say it’s needed to level the playing field and to mitigate systemic racism. They point out that Latino and Black students are underrepresented at the University of California compared with their high school graduation numbers. And supporters argue that businesses owned by Latino and Black people and women often get short shrift in government contracting contracting that historically tends to favor “the old boys’ network.” Opponents of the ballot measure contend that when one group is favored at the expense of another — when university slots are granted or denied because of a student’s student’s race or ethnicity — that’s discriminatory.

The series has some resonance with the work of Frederick Wiseman — whose “City Hall,” a 4 Whour film about institutional institutional civics in Boston, has also just been (virtually) released released — in its long form, patient patient pace and way of moving from thread to thread. But unlike Wiseman, the filmmaker filmmaker is an acknowledged presence in some scenes, less a fly on the wall than a fly on the wall who will buzz a direct question here and there.

For many liberals, the thought process — if you can call this hamster wheel of emotional reaction “thought” — goes something like this: The national polls show Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ahead by a wide margin, but then again, most of those same polls showed Hillary Clinton ahead four years ago (albeit by a smaller margin) and she wound up winning the popular vote and losing the election. (God, remember how terrible that night was, and the days after, just waiting for what had happened to somehow not have happened? happened? How can you win the popular vote and lose the election?

992,2487799850,"California not ‘hemorrhaging’ people State remains a powerhouse, but demographic and economic data do raise some concerns PERSPECTIVES MICHAEL HILTZIK That sound Californians are hearing from beyond beyond the Sierra and as far away as the Gulf of Mexico is bragging. The announced headquarters headquarters relocations of Silicon Valley stalwarts Oracle and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have Texas and other states boasting about their success success at drawing entrepreneurs entrepreneurs and businesses out of the Golden State. Farewell, Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX, decamped decamped to Texas. Goodbye, Larry Ellison, now a resident resident of Hawaii. One can even detect hand-wringing from this side of the state line. As my colleagues Hayley Smith and Hailey Branson-Potts reported, California’s population population growth in the year ended July 1 fell to 0.05%, a level not seen since 1900. The trend was attributed in part to a “continued exodus” of residents exasperated by the cost of living. The Sacramento Bee mined the same data and pronounced California “no longer a boom state.” The narrative of California’s California’s decline almost writes itself. In just the last month three major corporations corporations have announced headquarters headquarters relocations or other moves out of California: California: Hewlett Packard Enterprise will move its headquarters from San Jose to Houston and Oracle from Redwood City to Austin. Musk says he’s moving himself from Los Angeles to Texas because his two signature signature companies have operations there. Other tech companies are pondering pondering whether they need, or want, to stay in California. But can we get real for a moment? Yes, the state’s population population growth has slowed to a trickle. So has job growth, as my colleague Margot Roosevelt Roosevelt reports. The flattening out of population growth looks like a “sea change” in historical historical terms, observes Hans Johnson, a demographer at the Public Policy Institute of California. Johnson also notes, however, that “in some ways, the latest year’s data is just an incremental change from what we’ve been seeing over a couple of decades, which has been slowing population growth rates for California.” He adds that the population population trend isn’t anything like the hollowing-out suffered by the upper Plains states and Rust Belt cities such as Detroit, Cleveland and St. Louis, which have lost more than half their population in the last 50 years. “California doesn’t look like any of that,” he told me. “We don’t have areas where boarding up and demolishing demolishing houses is one of the big city government challenges. What we have in California is high housing prices because because we haven’t been able to build enough housing. So we’re not able to attract more people to our jobs than we would have otherwise.” otherwise.” That points to the most important challenge facing California government: housing. We’ll return to that shortly. Suffice to say that California, for all its pluses, has no cause to be complacent complacent about the future. First, let’s put the state’s economic and demographic trends in perspective. History teaches us to be wary of hasty declarations that the California dream is over. From the days of the Gold Rush and the earliest years of statehood, visitors to California have noticed dross mixed with the glitter. In an 1855 screed titled “The Land of Gold: Reality Versus Fiction,” a transplant transplant from North Carolina named Hinton R. Helper cursed the state’s “rottenDoyle “rottenDoyle McManus Letter from Washington does not appear today. Jonathan Newton Washington Post WORKERS put finishing touches on a prototype of SpaceX’s Starship in Brownsville, Texas. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and the carmaker Tesla, has moved his signature companies from L.A. to the Lone Star State. ness and its corruption, its squalor and its misery, its crime and its shame.” Horace Greeley, famous for having counseled young men to “Go West,” bemoaned bemoaned the spiritual and civic poverty of the Golden State after his own sole visit, in 1859. “In the course of several hundred miles’ travel through the less settled portions of this state,” he wrote, “I remember having seen but two school-houses outside of the cities and villages.” Greeley waxed poetic about the richness of the arable land but warned that “the deplorable confusion and uncertainty of land titles,” dating from the era of Mexican governance prior to U.S. annexation in 1848, “is the master-scourge of this state.” The land disputes wouldn’t be settled for years to come — a portent of the role that real estate has played in the state throughout throughout its history. As it happens, by 1860 Greeley warned that opportunities opportunities in California were almost tapped out. “No more merchants or clerks are wanted; and of those who come hereafter, ninetenths ninetenths will go back disappointed disappointed or impoverished, or stay here paupers.” Turning to population inflows versus outflows, it’s proper to keep in mind that California has experienced net out-migration to other states since about 1989. In some years the gap is wider than in others, but it is almost always an infinitesimal infinitesimal percentage of total population. In 2019, for instance, net out-migration from the state was 173,340 residents, the second-highest second-highest net outflow in this decade, decade, next to 2018. But it came to only 0.4% of the state’s population of 39.1 million. In other words, when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) claimed during a Senate debate in 2018 that California California was “hemorrhaging population,” he was lying. Who comes to California, who leaves and who stays? The state has consistently attracted more college graduates than it loses, a phenomenon that Johnson termed the “brain gain” in an article last year. In 201217, 201217, he found, the state gained a net 162,000 residents among people with bachelor’s bachelor’s or graduate degrees, while losing net population in every other educational category. Almost all the net gain was among college graduates graduates ages 20 to 29. “From a labor market perspective,” Johnson wrote, “attracting young college graduates is especially advantageous. Young adults with college degrees are at the start of their careers and provide the state with much-needed highly educated workers.” The state also shows a net gain among people with incomes of $110,000 and higher, while suffering a net loss in those with lower earnings. It’s unsurprising that younger and lower-income residents are leaving the state. California’s high rents, home prices and other costs of living pose a particular burden on those cohorts, who tend to be less settled and therefore more mobile than older households. households. Among the remaining factors in population are births, deaths and foreign immigration. California statistics are turning down in all three categories. The fertility rate, roughly defined as the average number number of children per woman of childbearing age, fell to about 1.65 in 2019 from 2.49 in 1990, according to the Department Department of Finance, which projects the rate to continue falling to 1.50 by 2040. Among the factors are shrinking immigration and the gradual aging of the population. The latter also accounts for a rise in the mortality rate. What does all this say about the California economy? economy? Not as much as you might think. Figures on the number of companies leaving leaving California are easy to find — corporate relocation firms, which make their money by facilitating those moves, are happy to provide them as a way of soliciting more business. But they tell only half the story. It’s one thing to say 1,800 businesses left the state in 2016, the most recent recent year available; quite another to observe that in the same year, 5,290 new businesses were formed, 1,000 WORDS: BARCELONA, Spain Emilio Morenatti Associated Press EU READIES VACCINE ROLLOUT Mortuary workers remove their protective clothing at the entrance of a building decorated with a Christmas Christmas tree after removing the body of a person who is suspected of having died from COVID-19 last week in Barcelona, Spain.

Since 2016, more new businesses have been launched in California than Texas every year except 2020 (thusfar). California’s rate of economic economic growth has largely paralleled that of Texas since the end of the last recession in mid-2009, but its economy remains much larger — $2.8 trillion in California California gross domestic product product as of the third quarter this year, compared with $1.8 trillion in Texas. Thus far, the investment scene in Silicon Valley appears appears to have kept up well in this pandemic year. That’s according to Fenwick & West, a Mountain View law firm that tracks venture capital flows. In its most recent survey, the firm found that venture financing financing was especially strong in life sciences, while software financings were holding their own in comparison to 2019. These statistics provide some useful context for lobbyists’ complaints about California’s poor business climate. The objections generally boil down to high taxes and intrusive regulations. Things are never that simple, however. California’s California’s personal income tax is high — especially for top earners such as CEOs, who have a strong voice in relocation relocation decisions. Earners of more than $1 million a year face a 13.3% marginal state tax rate in California, but would pay nothing in Texas. California’s property tax, however, is relatively low (thanks to Proposition 13). Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Tesla won’t escape much in the way of California corporate taxes because those are based on the share of sales taking place in the state. More than 40% of Tesla’s domestic sales are in California. Oracle Oracle and HPE say they are leaving most of their California California staff in place, but planning on doing more hiring elsewhere. California labor and environmental regulations are undoubtedly irksome for many employers and entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, but they are designed designed for the welfare of the community. Musk has groused plenty about labor and public health rules, of which he’s a serial flouter. Tesla has been accused of safety violations on the factory floor and defied government orders to shut down during the pandemic. Perhaps Texas will be more indulgent if Musk opens a factory there, but that might not entirely be to his workers’ benefit. Lurking within all these statistics, to be sure, are grounds for concern about California’s future. The cost of housing is a persistent and intensifying drag on growth. It’s a challenge challenge that the state’s leaders leaders and voters have been utterly unable to get their arms around. Oracle, Hewlett Packard and other companies should be believed when they say that they find it easier to recruit young workers to locations such as Austin or Miami than to the Bay Area, where owning a home is a forlorn dream for all but the highest earners and those already with a foothold in the California housing market. Most don’t leave California because they want to, but because the cost of living leaves them no other option. There are limits to what can be done about California’s California’s housing crisis. Plainly the state has not built anywhere near enough affordable housing to accommodate accommodate growth. But that’s not entirely because of planning and regulatory issues. To some extent, the problem is geographic: San Francisco, which is surrounded surrounded by water on three sides, has nowhere to expand, expand, in part because its residents demand restrictions restrictions on density. That has been exacerbated by the gentrification of the city, which has placed much of its real estate outside the reach of the middle class. Much of the rest of urban California has run out of room within sane commuting commuting distance of central cities or nearby suburbs. Some of the pressure might be alleviated alleviated by better mass transit, but progress on that front has been painfully slow and public acceptance has been weak. One imponderable for California’s future is the long-term impact of COVID-19. The work-fromhome work-fromhome habit has liberated millions of employees from the necessity of living near a central office and may have relieved pressure on California California rents, if not home prices, but how much that lifestyle will last beyond the end of the pandemic is impossible to say. It may be that the future will be one of slower growth for California than the state has seen in the past. Whether that might even be a good thing is a question that demographers will be watching closely. For now, they’re dealing with a historic historic anomaly. “For a Western state to join the ranks of states with zero population growth,” Johnson told me, “is something something we haven’t seen before.” before.” Follow @hiltzikm on Twitter, see his Facebook page or email michael.hiltzik @latimes.com.",12/27/2020,"('exacerbated', 'by', 'the')","('the', 'city', 'which')","[' That has been exacerbated by the gentrification of the city, which has placed much of its real estate outside the reach of the middle class.']", That has been exacerbated by the gentrification of the city which has placed much of its real estate outside the reach of the middle class

It was a place for queer Latinos to feel seen every night of the week. “Jalisco to me feels like going to, like, a family quinceahera,” said Gabriela Ruiz, 29, a queer performance performance artist. “Everyone there is like your gay uncle.” But that was before the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s been closed for almost a year, while other LGBTQ spaces throughout the city and country have shuttered shuttered for good: Cuties in East Hollywood Hollywood — L.A.’s only queer-focused coffee shop; Rage nightclub in West Hollywood; San Francisco’s oldest gay bar, the Stud; Little Jim’s, the second-oldest gay bar in Chicago. The decline of gay bars started well before the pandemic, in part because increased acceptance of queer people has lessened the need for bars as places of refuge. As many as 37% of LGBTQ bars shut down between 2007 and 2019, according to a study by Greggor Greggor Mattson, a sociology professor at Oberlin College in Ohio. The trend is even starker among bars serving people of color, with nearly 60% having closed by 2019. Mattson said bars serving working-class queer people are more likely to be pushed out by gentrification than those catering to middle-class and white gay men, he said. Historically, transgender and nonwhite people were unwelcome in many gay bars that served white men, Mattson said. “The irony is that just as gay bars have become more inclusive, they’re starting to go away,” he said. The owners of Jalisco are struggling struggling to ensure their closure isn’t permanent. Maria Rosa Garcia, 53, started as a bartender there in 1992. It was her first job in L.A. a few months after immigrating from Mexico City as a 24-year-old with her two daughters. Jalisco sits off Main and 2nd Street, across from the Vibiana, an arts center. Back then it was a billiards bar called Jalisco Inn. Garcia, outgoing and friendly, often threw back a beer or two with patrons as they exchanged stories and jokes. At the time, there was only one gay bar downtown: the Score. So when a few gay men started coming coming in, she welcomed them. As the owner got older, he left Garcia to manage the bar by herself. herself. When he died in 2005, Jalisco became hers officially. By then she had married Sergio Hernandez, who left his job as another bar’s security guard to help Garcia at Jalisco. Los Angeles in the 1990s was racially and politically tense. California California voters had approved Proposition Proposition 187, which sought to deny undocumented immigrants access access to services, including public healthcare and education. Then-President Clinton unveiled unveiled the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which prevented service members from being openly gay, lesbian or bisexual without the threat of being discharged. And the prevalence of AIDS among Latinos nationwide skyrocketed skyrocketed by 130% between 1993 and 2001 . At Jalisco, some patrons unaccustomed unaccustomed to seeing same-sex couples turned aggressive toward the new customers. After the Score closed in the early 2000s, LGBTQ patrons urged Garcia to dedicate her space to the community she had so openly accepted. “We have to recognize that this is a gay bar,” Hernandez told his wife. So they hung a rainbow flag outside. After that, the number of straight patrons decreased while LGBTQ patrons increased. Shunned or unwelcome elsewhere elsewhere in less tolerant times, queer people could gather in bars, which for generations served as the community’s public squares and remain hubs for organizing and fundraising. “Even still, in this era where we Average daily U.S. vims cases dip below100,000 By Sudhin Thanawala and Kate Brumback ATLANTA — Average daily new coronavims cases in the United States dipped below 100,000 in recent days for the first time in months, but experts cautioned Sunday Sunday that infections remain high and precautions to slow the COVID-19 pandemic must remain in place.

The cases are more than two-and-ahalf-fold two-and-ahalf-fold times what we saw over the summer,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Disease Control and Prevention, Prevention, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It’s encouraging to see these trends coming down, but they’re coming down from an extraordinarily high Steven Bernal DRAG PERFORMER Patty La Tres Pisos sings as Tina Turner during a show at the New Jalisco Bar.

Every queer person can tell you the first time they went to a gay bar. It’s still a rite of passage.” Mattson is sure the bars won’t entirely disappear. “Gay bars have survived political political oppression, the AIDS crisis, previous recessions, so they will survive this pandemic,” he said. “But there is something special lost when a bar of 30 years goes under, because it takes with it a local history and a staff that knows people’s names.” In recent years, roaming circuit parties have become popular among queer youth. And more bars that cater to the broader LGBTQ community, including Micky’s in West Hollywood, dedicate dedicate certain nights of the week to Latinos and other ethnic groups. But just as there’s no substitute for a queer bar, there’s no substitute substitute for those catering to Latinos, says Eddy Francisco Alvarez Jr., an assistant professor of Chicana and Chicano studies at Cal State Fullerton whose research includes queer Latinx history. What the community needs, he said, are more “joteria spaces” — places where queer Latinos “don’t have to compartmentalize different different parts of who we are,” he said. “We can show up and be Latino, Chicano, immigrant, Afro-Latino, femme and trans — all of those place.” On Saturday, the sevenday sevenday rolling average for deaths was around 2,500. That number peaked at more than 3,300 earlier in the winter, according to Johns Hopkins. The U.S. saw a spike of more than 5,400 deaths reported reported Friday — nearly half from Ohio, where authorities authorities said earlier in the week that they planned to add deaths to the state’s tally over the course of a few days after discovering as many as 4,000 unreported COVID-19 fatalities. Walensky added that new variants, including one first detected in the United Kingdom Kingdom that appears to be more intersecting identities — and just be who we want to be. And be messy.” Above the entrance to Jalisco, a mural depicts people dancing against a lavender background — two women, two cowboys, singers Celia Cruz and Juan Gabriel, as well as Ignacio “Nacho” Nava Jr., a local queer nightlife icon who died in 2019. Ruiz, the performance artist, painted the mural along with the artist Rafa Esparza. They took inspiration from a Mexican newspaper newspaper illustration from 1901 called “The Dance of the 41,” based on a scandal in which police raided a dance attended by men, some of whom were wearing dresses. Nightlife spaces are often trivialized, trivialized, Alvarez said, but they are places not only of diversion and celebration, but also where sorrow can be shared and hardships eased. During the AIDS crisis, showing up at the club meant you had survived, he said. “We can’t do that now,” he said. “We can’t go to the club and grieve out the loss of our loved ones dying from this pandemic. There’s that conundrum of not being able to congregate and be with each other, bailando.” At Jalisco, among the many economic casualties of the pandemic pandemic is Vanessa Antonely, a drag performer who specialized in lip syncing as Adele and Amanda Miguel. Antonely, 44, had hustled between between Jalisco, another job charging charging entry at Club Cobra in North Hollywood and side gigs as a makeup artist. She had transmissible and has already already been recorded in more than 30 states, will probably lead to more cases and more deaths. “All of it really wraps up into we can’t let our guard down,” she said. “We have to continue wearing masks. We have to continue with our current mitigation measures. measures. And we have to continue continue getting vaccinated as soon as that vaccine is available available to us.” The U.S. has recorded more than 27.5 million coronavirus coronavirus cases and more than 485,000 deaths, according according to the Johns Hopkins data. With parents and political political leaders eager to have quinceaheras and weddings lined up for all of 2020. Then everything ground to a halt. Cobra, which also catered to LGBTQ Latinos, closed in May. Recently, she started assisting her partner in running a mobile dog grooming business. Antonely had always been an optimist; the lighthearted, funny friend in the group. But as she watched her $13,000 in savings dwindle to zero, knowing she lacked the legal status necessary to qualify for unemployment and other benefits, she fell into a deep depression. “When you are trans, people think you’ll either cut hair or become become a prostitute,” she said. “They limit you to that.” But she had always wanted to perform. Working Working at LGBTQ spaces was a lifeline. lifeline. Jalisco had 20 employees — Garcia, Hernandez and three bartenders, plus the drag performers performers and D Js, who were gig workers. Most of them are trans, and around half are without papers. Every employee was left jobless March 16, the day that Los Angeles County officials mandated the closure of bars and gyms. Garcia and Hernandez took advantage of the initial closure and invested their $10,000 savings in renovations, re-tiling and upgrading upgrading the old plumbing in the women’s bathroom, and creating a dressing room so drag performers wouldn’t have to get ready in a small storage closet. Hangers were placed on a clothing rack tall enough to keep gowns off the floor. children around the country back in school for in-person learning, it is important that people continue to observe precautions, Walensky Walensky said. “We need to all take responsibility responsibility to decrease that community spread, including including mask wearing, sothat we can get our kids and our society society back,” she said. The CDC released guidance guidance on Friday outlining mitigation strategies necessary necessary to reopen schools or to keep them open. Some teachers have expressed expressed concern about returning returning to the classroom without having been vaccinated, vaccinated, but the guidelines do not say that’s necessary. But the grand reopening never came. Instead, Garcia and Hernandez Hernandez visited their beloved bar once a week to check the mail, holding their breath each time for bills. Inside, the exposed brick walls are decorated with portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. A small sign behind the long bar, easy to miss in the dark glow lighting, depicts a woman in a sombrero pointing two guns. “Yo naci cabrona porque pendejas pendejas ya habia muchas, ” it reads. I was born a badass because there were already too many idiots. Yellow duct tape Xs on the tile floor mark where tables would have gone when indoor service briefly resumed in June. But before before Garcia and Hernandez could follow through, Gov. Gavin Newsom Newsom ordered bars in Los Angeles to close again as COVID-19 cases escalated. On a recent visit, Hernandez opened up a metal cooler and removed a bottle of Miller Lite. He put on his glasses to read the small, gold-stamped expiration date: Aug. 3,2020. They owe $55,000 in rent alone. Almost $5,000 in beer and other alcohol has expired and must be tossed. Standing behind the bar, with dozens of envelopes stacked on the counter in front of her, Garcia picked up a bill from the Los Angeles Angeles Department of Water and Power and ripped the seal. The total: $5,954.42. Garcia and Hernandez know intimately the struggles of Antonely Antonely and the other undocumented undocumented workers. Because they, too, lack legal status, they’ve been ineligible for the small-business loans and other COVID-related federal government relief. Instead, Hernandez took a job at a moving company and Garcia has taken to slinging tacos and quesadillas in front of their South L.A. home. Just before Christmas, Ruiz reached out to see how they were doing. Saddened by the thought that Jalisco could close for good, she helped them create an online fundraiser. It is now past halfway to the $80,000 goal. Donors shared memories and gratitude. “The New Jalisco has been there for me when I needed a queer space to feel safe,” one person wrote. Jalisco “is a community space as much as it is a bar,” said another. another. While significant, the amount raised points to the socioeconomic gap between patrons of Jalisco and places such as the Silver Lake mainstay Akbar, which was on the verge of closing before its owners raised $230,000 in donations. If Jalisco survives the pandemic, pandemic, Garcia and Hernandez will still have the gentrification of their neighborhood to contend with. Garcia said they pay half the rent of some of their new neighbors. On a Thursday night last month, Garcia stood before a grill set up under a canopy on the dark street in front of her house. A small LED sign in one comer flashed “tacos.” She squeezed fresh tortillas on a wooden press. A deep fryer made a hollow crackling noise as quesadillas quesadillas cooked. Antonely, the drag dancer, soon pulled up with other Jalisco workers: workers: Marco Ortiz, known for impressions impressions of Juan Gabriel and Vicente Fernandez; Lluvia Guzman, Guzman, who directed the shows and performed as Jenni Rivera; and Chantal Fernandez, who imitated Cher and Katy Perry. The group said they had become become closer friends during the pandemic. Despite their own struggles with joblessness, they reunited a few times a week for dinner at Garcia’s. She had given them work, they reasoned, so now it was their turn to support her. Garcia set mugs of hot cafe de olla and plates of buttered bolillos on the table for her friends. “No te preocupes, Rosita, ” Antonely told her. Don’t worry. We will all go back to work at Jalisco. Dr. Anthony Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that it would be “optimal” “optimal” if teachers were vaccinated vaccinated but that other measures measures laid out in the 24-page document can lessen their risk. “Practically speaking, when you balance the benefit benefit of getting the children back to school with the fact that the risks are being mitigated, mitigated, if you follow the recommendations recommendations and these new guidelines from the CDC, hopefully, I think that will alleviate the concerns on both sides,” he said.

He was wrong. The Tulsa Race Massacre was a little-known chapter of the country’s troubling history of race relations, in which a prosperous and independent independent Black community called Greenwood Greenwood was savaged by angry white people who killed hundreds of Black residents and set fires to numerous homes and businesses. The attack, ignited by a false accusation of assault, has been ignored or downplayed for decades in school curricula, which Silvers thought would give a documentary examination even greater value. “I was saddened beyond words that our country had suppressed a key component of our history, a dark era that helps us understand where we are now and who we are now,” Silvers said of his interest in making the film. But when he and his producing team started pitching the project in 2019, he ran into a wall. “We tried for at least a year to interest a number of broadcasters in the project, and none of them at the time recognized the nature of what we were doing,” Silver said. “We weren’t just exposing a mass atrocity, atrocity, but a mass atrocity that had The biggest news.

Adapted from Alan Moore’s hit graphic novel, “Watchmen” reinterpreted reinterpreted its tale about a group of ragged superheroes by mixing science science fiction, contemporary themes and real historical events. The first episode begins with an explosive reenactment of the attack on Greenwood, Greenwood, including Black men being dragged by cars through the streets and planes dropping bombs on the community. This Memorial Day weekend, the centennial of the riot, will be marked by at least four in-depth documentaries, documentaries, including “Tulsa: The Fire and the Forgotten,” Silvers’ project that he developed with veteran Washington Post reporter DeNeen L. Brown and preeminent war crimes investigator Eric Stover. The film will air Monday on PBS. The other documentaries airing this weekend are “Tulsa Burning: The 1921 Race Massacre” (History, Sunday), a two-hour film directed by Emmy winner Stanley Nelson (whose films include “Freedom Riders”) and Marco Williams and executive produced by NBA star Russell Westbrook, among others; “Dreamland: The Burning of Black Wall Street” (CNN, Monday), a two-hour film from director Salima Koroma (“Bad Rap”), produced in collaboration with NBA superstar LeBron James’ Springhill Entertainment Entertainment Co.; and the two-part docuseries “The Legacy of Black Wall Street” (premiering Tuesday on Discovery-i- and OWN). On June 18, National Geographic will air another project featuring Brown, “Rise Again: Tulsa and the Jonathan Silvers Saybrook Productions Ltd. Red Summer.” Silvers was not the only filmmaker filmmaker to meet resistance to a Tulsa documentary in just the last few years. “Nobody wanted it. Everyone seemed scared or claimed that the demographics were not right,” said Koroma, who started pitching her project in 2017. “One response that really stuck with me was someone telling me that the demographic of 30- to 55-year-old white men would not relate to the story.” Using different approaches and perspectives that occasionally overlap, overlap, the documentaries dive not only into Tulsa’s horrific past, but also the efforts to cover it up through the decades and how the riot relates to the Black Lives Matter protests that were reignited last year after the killing of George Floyd. Several include interviews with descendants of victims of the massacre. massacre. Also featured are black-andwhite black-andwhite photographs and film footage of Greenwood in its prime before the riot, as well as some of its most prominent entrepreneurs, who built successful hotels, theaters, stores and other businesses. Some of the filmmakers said the examination of the riot has become THE 1921 aftermath, top, as seen in “Tulsa Burning.” DeNeen Brown, a producer of “Tulsa: The Fire and the Forgotten,” at the site of suspected mass graves. Illllllllllllllll even more timely due to the fiery racial tensions that have erupted in the last year, sparked by ongoing police brutality against unarmed Black people, a divisive presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic’s pandemic’s disproportionate effect on Black and Latino people. “I hope people will be moved by the systematic destruction and devastation and see the parallels with today, which are obvious and evident,” Nelson said. “Watchmen” creator Damon Lindelof, whose series helped spark the new wave of interest, said he learned of the attack from the writing writing of African American author Ta-Nehisi Coates (“Between the World and Me”), a frequent chronicler chronicler of Black identity and white supremacy. “I consider myself a student of U.S. history and I thought, ‘How did this slip through the cracks?’ ” Lindelof Lindelof said in an interview when the drama premiered. “I felt incredible shame and guilt.” Brown called “Watchmen” a “catalyst” “catalyst” that made a big difference in the riot getting more attention. Since then, the massacre also has been depicted in HBO’s “Lovecraft Country,” and MTV Entertainment Studios announced last week that a scripted limited series on the subject subject is in the works, with actors Courtney B. Vance and Angela Bassett signed on as producers. “When ‘Watchmen’ aired, there were a lot of smart people who said, ‘How come I never heard about this?’ ” Brown said. “They said, ‘Did this really happen?’ ” Brown was one of the first journalists who started digging into Tulsa’s troubled past, and the covemp thereof, when she visited her father in Tulsa in 2018. She recalled being disturbed by the gentrification of the community that was once hit by rioters. “I saw a yoga studio, all this development, development, and I thought it was strange to see this on the site of this horrific incident,” she said. She wrote a story about unmarked mass graves of victims of the carnage that wound up on the front page. Regina King, who starred in “Watchmen,” tweeted out that story when folks asked her if the events shown in the series were true. Silvers said, “ ‘Watchmen’ changed things a little bit. I’m deeply conflicted about the cartooning cartooning of American history and culture, but people started paying attention. It made them curious. And when the protests of last summer made it concrete that racial violence is not an episode but a continuum of the Black experience, that’s when everyone everyone started to pay attention.” Most of the filmmakers did not seem to be concerned about so many documentaries on the Tulsa Race Massacre appearing at the same time, feeling that the films would more likely complement each other. “There are many films about other events such as the Holocaust,” Nelson said. “I’m not concerned at all.” Added Koroma: “In America, we often tell Black stories one way, while other stories are told several different ways. My film is not able to tell the whole story. It helps my film to have these other films because it gives it a greater context. I don’t see them as competing, and I can’t wait to see the other ones.”",5/30/2021,"('disturbed', 'by', 'the')","('the', 'community', 'that')",[' She recalled being disturbed by the gentrification of the community that was once hit by rioters.'], She recalled being disturbed by the gentrification of the community that was once hit by rioters

While Paramount-!- has a broad array of material, it doesn’t have the brand awareness of some of its rivals rivals such as HBO/HBO Max (69.4 million subscribers), Disney+ (116 million) and Netflix (214 million), said Steven Cahall, senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.

That deal was signed in September September 2019, after Viacom and CB S agreed to merge but before before the transaction closed and plans for Paramount+ took shape. It had a similar problem with “South Park,” which is licensed to HBO Max for streaming. To alleviate that issue, McCarthy signed “South Park” creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker to a deal for two movies a year through 2027 for Paramount-!- that are based on the beloved, foul-mouthed animated show. The “South Park” pact, which includes additional additional seasons of the Comedy Comedy Central staple, is valued at $900 million. “He believes in franchises,” franchises,” ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish said of McCarthy. “We have some franchises that were, call it ‘encumbered,’ in streaming.

He rose through the ranks to become become president of VH1 and Logo TV in 2016, shortly before before also taking over MTV, where he was tasked with turning around the struggling struggling brands. In a key early move, McCarthy McCarthy revived the “Jersey Shore” franchise with “Floribama “Floribama Shore” and “Jersey Shore: Family Vacation,” which have both run for four seasons. Also in unscripted, he launched “The Challenge: Challenge: All Stars” for Paramount-!-, Paramount-!-, a spinoff from the MTV reality competition show. “I think having grown up at MTV, you really learn how to thrive in chaos and complicated complicated times,” McCarthy said. “Everything is constantly constantly changing. It ended up being an incredible skill as I matured throughout the company.” Overseeing a portfolio of scripted dramas is a relatively relatively new area for McCarthy, McCarthy, who made his mark by expanding reality franchises such as “Love & Hip Hop” and “Black Ink Crew.” But the growing audience audience for “Yellowstone” gave executives confidence. Once McCarthy’s group took over Paramount Network, they decided to promote the show, which had an olderskewing olderskewing audience, on its youth-focused networks, including including MTV and VH1. Season 3 viewership averaged averaged 6.2 million, up 22% from the second season, culminating culminating in 7.6 million for the finale, according to Nielsen data. The company also saw significant growth of digital download sales, which totaled totaled $60 million last year, equal to 1 million to 3 million viewers, according to people familiar with the financials. Plus, the series reaches demos that were underserved underserved by prestigious dramas dramas that are popular in Los Angeles and New York. The show is popular in cities in the South and Midwest, including including Dallas, Denver and Kansas City, and over-indexes over-indexes in smaller counties. The demographics also overlapped with CBS’ NFL audience. SIMILAR THEMES While “Mayor of Kingstown” Kingstown” and the upcoming oil industry drama are not directly directly related to “Yellowstone,” “Yellowstone,” Sheridan’s shows tend to explore similar themes, which are universal but also relevant to specific regions of the country. Those often include the gentrification gentrification of the American West and the failure of institutions, institutions, whether it’s the oil industry, local government or the penal system. “What we’re doing is serving serving audiences that are really starving for content,” McCarthy McCarthy said. “We are in the business of driving massive commercial hits. We can’t survive on just the coasts.” David C. Glasser, chief executive of “Yellowstone” production company 101 Studios, credited McCarthy with doubling down on the series despite the risks. “Their reputation for turning around businesses and world-building is terrific, terrific, but it’s been chiefly in the unscripted space,” said Glasser, previously Weinstein Weinstein Co.'s president and chief operating officer, of McCarthy’s McCarthy’s group. “Rather than change course, [they] did just the opposite by immediately immediately doubling down on ‘Yellowstone’ and Taylor.” The franchise’s growth was partly the result of a period period of creative productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic pandemic for Sheridan. In four months, he said, he turned in a slew of scripts for the overall overall deal he signed with ViacomCBS ViacomCBS in 2020. The company company wanted more. “I think they saw an opportunity opportunity to build a bigger world, at the same time people people had a lot of time to sort of reassess, and they decided to really double down on Paramount-!- Paramount-!- and the kind of content I make,” Sheridan said. “And so I talked to Chris about a lot of ambitious ambitious ideas, and he bet on them.” McCarthy was sold on the idea of an expanded “ Yellowstone""-related Yellowstone""-related franchise after hearing Sheridan explain explain his ideas, including the one for “1883,” which he saw as a grand-scale expansion on the world and themes established established by the original series. series. While Sheridan’s work is steeped in classic western drama, his films and shows complicate the traditional good guy-versus-bad guy narratives of the genre. “This was a conversation he was already having with himself,” McCarthy said. “When you listen to him tell a story, it’s like telling the story of America gone West, the fight for the last frontier. ...

Whipping her long red hair as her hips shimmied under a pair of billowing harem harem pants, she sang about searching for pleasure in tunes that moved fluidly from sparkly disco to plush R&B. The mode was seductive yet hardly accommodating: Near the end of her brief set — at Jingle Ball you get about 20 minutes to do your thing— Doja Cat did ferocious renditions renditions of her songs “Tia Tarnera” Tarnera” and “Need to Know,” spitting densely phrased lyrics as her drummer pushed the music toward growling rap-rock. Lil Nas X was equally forthright in showcasing gay Black desire as he and his troupe of male dancers writhed through songs such songs as “Industry Baby,” “Scoop” and the chart-topping chart-topping “Montero (Call Me by Your Name),” which he remade remade as a heavy-breathing mashup with Beyonce’s “Baby Boy.” Like Doja Cat’s, Lil Nas X’s music roams genres freely; “Lost in the Citadel” was crisp pop-punk, while “Holiday” sounded like oldschool oldschool ’N Sync. And as suits someone who came of age on the internet, he can toggle cleanly among emotional registers: Before “That’s What I Want,” a yearning number about needing “a boy who can cuddle with me all night,” Lil Nas X asked the crowd, “Who wants love?” — then added with perfect coming coming timing, “Well, you’re never gonna get it.” In addition to these new stars, Jingle Ball made room for old ones: Ed Sheeran was there to do a couple of his sappy acoustic love songs, and the Black Eyed Peas closed the show with a rapidfire rapidfire run through big, dumb stadium-rave jams like “I Gotta Feeling.” (Dua Lipa, the British dance-pop singer who represents a sort of intergenerational figure, canceled canceled because of laryngitis.)

This fall, she hosted several several events in the park where people from the community could get linked up to mental health services, and in the future she hopes to open a workshop where people with disabilities and those experiencing experiencing homelessness can make a living. “There is so much we can do!” she said. Both in her personal connection connection to the issue of homelessness homelessness and her hopeful outlook about future solutions, solutions, Cauich is emblematic of a larger trend borne out in a new poll of Los Angeles County voters: While Latino and Black respondents were the most likely to have either experienced homelessness or housing insecurity in the last year or to have known someone who had, they were also more optimistic about solving homelessness than their white and Asian American counterparts. The poll, which was conducted conducted by the Los Angeles Business Council Institute in cooperation with The Times, found that 94% of voters view homelessness as a serious or very serious problem. There were, however, however, demonstrable differences differences in outlook that broke down along racial and ethnic lines. While white voters most often cited lack of access to healthcare as the root cause of homelessness, Black, Latino Latino and Asian American voters voters most often pointed to soaring housing costs and low wages. Black and Latino voters were also more likely to say they thought officials should prioritize providing services over clearing encampments. “When we talk about the population of homeless in skid row and the amount of the homeless that are people of color, you’ve got to understand understand this: It’s a direct relationship relationship to the lack of opportunity opportunity that is there for people people in L.A.,” said Shirley Raines, founder of Beauty 2 the Streetz, a nonprofit that provides hot meals and makeovers to people on skid row. Every Saturday for the last four years, Raines, 52, has risen before the sun, put on her trademark colorful makeup and packed her car with supplies. She arrives with food, hygiene kits, sleeping bags, blankets and, these days, hand sanitizer and face masks. For several hours, she gives haircuts, Emmett Till investigation is closed Justice Department makes no new charges after inquiry into 1955 murder of Black teen. ASSOCIATED PRESS JACKSON, Miss. — The U.S. Justice Department on Monday told relatives of Emmett Till that it is ending its latest investigation into the 1955 lynching of the Black teenager from Chicago, Chicago, who was abducted, tortured and killed after witnesses witnesses said he whistled at a white woman in Mississippi. Till’s family members said they were disappointed that there will continue to be no accountability for the killing, with no charges being filed against Carolyn Bryant Donham, the woman accused of lying about whether Till touched her. “Today is a day we will never forget,” Till’s cousin, the Rev. Wheeler Parker, said during a news conference conference in Chicago. “For 66 years we have suffered pain. ...I suffered tremendously.” The killing galvanized the civil rights movement after Till’s mother insisted on an open casket, and Jet magazine published photos of his brutalized body. The Justice Department braids hair and does people’s people’s makeup, a process that lifts their spirits — and her own. She grew up in Compton, an environment that she says was rife with trauma and “negative talk,” and because because of her upbringing, she said, she identifies deeply with the homeless people she meets. She knows that many of them got the same message from the world that she did: “You will never be nothing, never have nothing. You’ve come too far in your trauma, that there’s no way of coming coming back from it.” Raines’ 2-year-old son died in 1990 after accidentally accidentally ingesting medication, and she was stricken by grief for years. On the anniversary anniversary of his death in 2017, her twin sister suggested she channel her hurt into a cause and she began serving Meals on Wheels and joined a support group for women who lost children. She found that too painful, but soon took her first volunteer trip to skid row. “I just felt at home, I felt like I didn’t have to change. I didn’t have to put on a facade,” she said. “I could go out there and be myself. And they could be themselves without any judgment.” The volunteer work she does now brings back memories memories of her grandmother and other matriarchs in the community who lived in service to their neighbors in Compton. “If your parents were at work, my grandmother was watching you,” she said. “If you couldn’t eat, my grandmother grandmother was feeding you.” The work she does on skid row often requires her to enforce boundaries and to grow comfortable with disappointment, disappointment, Raines said, but it is also deeply encouraging. encouraging. “I don’t have a lot of stories stories about getting people off the street,” she said. “But I do have a lot of stories about people still waking up despite despite the circumstances that they’re in and coming to see us.” In a trend that plays out across the nation and worsened worsened during the pandemic, Los Angeles’ homeless population is shaped by steep racial inequities. Black residents account for roughly 8% of L.A.

And those intractable inequalities inequalities are often cited by local officials — who during the pandemic made an ambitious ambitious but faltering push to move homeless people into Associated Press EMMETT TILL, 14, was killed following accusations accusations by a white woman. reopened the investigation after a 2017 book quoted Donham as saying she lied when she claimed that 14year-old 14year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances while she was working in a store in the community of Money, Miss.

Respondents to the recent recent poll were asked to choose words describing how they felt about homelessness, homelessness, including “sympathetic,” “sympathetic,” “unsafe,” “angry,” “indifferent,” “hopeful,” “disappointed” “disappointed” and “sad.” Black and Latino voters reported feeling “sad,” “disappointed” “disappointed” and “sympathetic” at higher rates than white and Asian American respondents, respondents, who were more likely than Black and Latino voters voters to feel “unsafe.” “Sad” is the first thing that comes to Blanca Rodriguez’s Rodriguez’s mind. “I feel a deep sadness,” the 69-year-old said through tears on a recent afternoon while standing in the doorway doorway of her shop, Blanca’s Beauty Salon, off a strip of Whittier Boulevard that weaves beneath the 60 Freeway. Freeway. There, in the shadowed underpass, three people slept on tattered mattresses as cars zipped by. Rodriguez said one man who used to live there often meandered the sidewalk outside her shop, frequently bending down as if to pick up something even though nothing was there. His mind had betrayed him, she could see, and she often said a quick prayer asking God to 2017’s “The Blood of Emmett Till,” was unable to produce any recordings or transcripts transcripts in which Donham admitted to lying about her encounter with the teen. “In closing this matter without prosecution, the government does not take the position that the state court testimony the woman gave in 1955 was truthful or accurate,” the news release said. “There remains considerable considerable doubt as to the credibility credibility of her version of events, which is contradicted by others who were with Till at the time, including the account account of a living witness.” Days after Till was killed, his body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River, where it was tossed after being weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Two white men, Roy Bryant Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam, were tried on murder charges about a month after Till was killed; an all-white Mississippi jury acquitted them. Months later, they confessed in a paid interview with Look magazine. Bryant married Donham in 1955. The Justice Department in 2004 opened an investigation investigation into Till’s killing after it received inquiries about whether charges could be brought against anyone still living. The department said the protect him. “We’re all the same,” she said. “We all come from a mother’s womb and we will all die.” Rodriguez knows what it feels like to stress over finances finances — she easily saw 10 customers a day before the pandemic, but now is lucky to give even a single haircut or two a day. Many months, she makes barely enough to cover the $700 payment on her home and has had to dip into her small savings to cover bills and food. She said she hopes that, going forward, politicians will prioritize immediate help for homeless people, including including moving them into vacant apartments or hotel rooms. “The need is now.” Beverly Vasquez, a manager manager at Nimbus Coffee in downtown L.A., said she interacts interacts with unhoused people people almost every day. Some businesses in the area, as well as some residents residents and police, react by shooing the unhoused away, she said, moving them somewhere else — anywhere else. But she and the owners of Nimbus, all women of color, try to take a different approach approach where they can, handing out water during slow hours and sometimes doling out unsold pastries at the end of the day. statute of limitations had run out on any potential federal federal crime, but the FBI worked with state investigators investigators to determine if state charges could be brought. In February 2007, a Mississippi grand jury declined to indict anyone, and the Justice Department Department announced that it was closing the case. Bryant and Milam were not brought to trial again; both have since died. Donham Donham has been living in Raleigh, N.C. The FBI in 2006 began a cold case initiative to investigate investigate racially motivated killings from decades earlier. A federal law named after Till allows a review of killings that had not been solved or prosecuted to the point of a conviction. The Emmett Till Unsolved Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act requires the Justice Department Department to make an annual report to Congress. No report report was filed in 2020, but a report in June of this year indicated indicated that the department department was still investigating Till’s abduction and killing.

One mormng while heading heading into work during a rainstorm, rainstorm, she noticed a woman she’d seen before — a thin, Black woman in her 20s or 30s — and invited her into the shop for a pastry and shelter from the rain. Navigating interactions with unhoused people can be difficult for businesses, Vasquez acknowledged, noting noting that the women who run Nimbus work hard to maintain maintain a pristine storefront and sometimes have anxieties anxieties about their safety early in the morning and late at night. “It is a little unsettling when you see groups of people people living near your business,” business,” Vasquez says, but still she favors a more humane approach over harsh policing policing of unhoused people. “People have to remember remember that can easily be you.” Back in Hollenbeck Park, a 44-year-old woman, who introduced herself using only her first name, Lourdes, sat in the shade of a palm tree, folding clothes. She’d been homeless for three months, she said, and had come to the park that morning to change in the bathroom and relax somewhere somewhere she felt safe — a place where the paranoid thoughts that sometimes run through her mind would slow. She picked up a T-shirt and ripped it in half, tying the strip of fabric around her head to cover several scabs — reminders, she said, of a meth addiction she desperately desperately wants to break. “I just need help,” she said, “real help.” Brenda Martinez, the homeless liaison for the Boyle Heights Neighborhood Neighborhood Council, said she beNYC beNYC is set to impose vaccination mandate on private employers ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK — Private employers in New York City will have to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their workers under new rules announced Monday by Mayor Bill de Blasio. The vaccination mandate mandate for private businesses will take effect Dec. 27 and is aimed at preventing a spike in coronavirus infections during the holiday season and the rest of the winter, the mayor said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “We in New York City have decided to use a preemptive preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of COVID and the dangers it’s causing to all of us,” De Blasio said. “All private-sector employers employers in New York City will be covered by this vaccine mandate mandate as of Dec. 27.” Vaccinations are already required for workers at hospitals hospitals and nursing homes and for city employees, including including teachers, police officers officers and firefighters. A vaccination mandate for employees of private and religious schools was announced announced last week. The city was moving to impose the mandate on private-sector private-sector businesses even as federal courts have temporarily temporarily blocked an attempt by President Biden to do the same nationally for larger companies. De Blasio said he expects lieves more opportunities for drug addiction treatment treatment and more sustainable housing options are key components to reducing homelessness. “This problem is just going going to get bigger and bigger,” she said, adding that most people in the neighborhood are renters and will only have a harder time staying in their homes given the rapid gentrification of the area and stagnation of wages. Although Boyle Heights doesn’t get nearly the same amount of resources as nearby skid row, many of the problems from that stretch of downtown spill over into Boyle Heights, said Martinez, Martinez, who added that she believes the truest solution lies in increasing wages for workers in low-income communities. communities. “Families here are very proud. They want to be able to afford their food,” she said. “They want work. They want better wages.” She finds a lot of hope in the work of people in her community, like Cauich, her close friend. For Cauich, her deep passion passion for giving back grew out of understanding. She vividly vividly remembers the day years ago when she came home to her apartment and found new locks on the door. She was going through a divorce divorce and had lost her job as a cashier, so for a time she slept sitting up on a bench outside in Koreatown with her two children, then 3 and 4, asleep beneath a blanket in a stroller. Now, whenever a homeless homeless friend flashes a look of bewilderment and asks why she does what she does, she gives a variation of the same answer. “I was in your shoes once.” the new mandate to survive any legal challenges. A spokesperson for the mayor said the mandate would apply apply to about 184,000 businesses. businesses. Current New York rules demand at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose for access to indoor restaurant dining, entertainment venues venues and fitness centers. Under new mandates for indoor dining, entertainment entertainment and gyms, two shots will be required for people over 12. One shot will be required required for 5- to 11-year-olds, who are not covered by the current mandate, De Blasio said.

But Kevin Shaw’s “Let the Little Light Shine” ends with such a “power of filmmaking” filmmaking” bang that it’s a struggle not to lead with it. With great reluctance, I will not. “Let the Little Light Shine,” which had its world premiere at the recent True/ False Film Fest in Columbia, Mo., and will be available on PBS’ “POV” series in December, December, is the story of the battle to save the National Teachers Academy, a South Chicago K-8 school serving mostly Black fam ili es. Shaw’s ability to maintain maintain a propulsive beat while making a movie that involves involves a fair number of school board meetings borders borders on the miraculous. Documenting an evolving evolving story forces a filmmaker to give up all control of the two things he or she feels most strongly about — the picture’s ending and its message. As the fate of the school hung in the balance, Shaw was prepared to make what would be, essentially, two movies. One would be a story of struggle and mourning; school closures, he says, put people through stages of grief similar to those surrounding surrounding death. The other would be a real-life example of a favored Hollywood narrative — struggle and triumph. During its premiere at True/False, where it was chosen as the Show Me True/False honoree, “Little Light” regularly moved members of the audience to groans, gasps, cheers, tears and, finally, a standing ovation. ovation. You can read that as a spoiler, but in any case, such audible emotional engagement engagement is not something one typically encounters while watching a documentary, even at a film festival, and Pixar embraces teenage panda-monium [‘Turning Red,’ from El] oversized plush toy (and the latest merchandising boon to the Walt Disney Co.), but she’s also one hell of a menstrual menstrual metaphor. Which is not to say that “Turning Red” — a cheeky title title for a movie that sometimes sometimes plays like “Carrie” with the cutes, or “The Joy Luck Club” meets “Ginger Snaps” — deals purely in the metaphorical. After decades of Disney animated entertainments entertainments that thrive on the emotions (but not the effluvia) effluvia) of young womanhood, this charming comic fantasy — arriving this week on Disney-!- Disney-!- but not, regrettably, in theaters — marks something something of a messy pubescent milestone. It’s surely the first movie of its kind to introduce introduce sanitary pads as a plot device, which is scarcely the least of its many key precedents. It also happens to be the first to boast a Chinese Chinese Canadian girl protagonist protagonist who keeps a Tamagotchi Tamagotchi (it’s set in the early 2000s), fawns over a boy band and still manages to get straight As. (Mei twerks hard, but she works harder.) Perhaps not coincidentally, coincidentally, it’s also the first Pixar feature directed solely by a woman: Domee Shi, here confidently expanding on the images and ideas of her scrumptious 2018 Oscarwinning Oscarwinning short, “Bao.” That gender precedent is more depressing than laudable, laudable, and in appreciating the taboo-busting, culturally inclusive inclusive virtues of “Turning Red,” we should be cautious about overpraising a corporate corporate giant that’s always been quicker to congratulate itself itself than to evolve. Still, as Mei (delightfully voiced by Rosalie Chiang) rightly enthuses, enthuses, “Nothing stays the same forever” — not hidebound hidebound movie studios, and certainly not teen girls. When we first meet Mei, an eighth-grader with round glasses and a garlic-bulb nose, she’s already on the cusp of major change. For 13 years she’s been the picture of filial obedience, an eagerto-please eagerto-please overachiever who helps her parents run their ancestral temple in Toronto’s Toronto’s Chinatown. But her True / False Film Fest EFFORTS to save a beloved Chicago public school are the focus of documentary “Let the Little Light Shine.” certainly not one about a public school. But then, NTA is not a typical public school. Built in 2006 near the now defunct Harold Ickes public housing project, the academy was, when Shaw began filming in 2017, top ranked, with a beloved beloved and devoted staff, dedicated parents and highly motivated students. (If you love “Abbott Elementary,” Elementary,” you will love this film.) Then, it became the fulcrum fulcrum of tensions surrounding surrounding the ongoing gentrification gentrification of the South Loop. For years, white families had been moving into the neighborhood neighborhood in growing numbers, numbers, but many refused to Disney / Pixar IN “TURNING RED,” Mei Lee’s giant red panda is a metaphor for menstruation and her Chinese heritage. ‘Turning Red* Rated: PG, for thematic material, suggestive content and language Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes Playing: Available for streaming Friday on Disney+ perfect-daughter devotion is increasingly at odds with other interests: her pop culture culture enthusiasms, intense crushes and supercool friends. (Her terrific trio of besties is voiced by Ava Morse, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan Ramakrishnan and Hyein Park.) And so when Mei awakens awakens and finds herself pandafied pandafied for the first time, she’s unsurprisingly mortified at this bizarre outward manifestation manifestation of her inner unrest. Part of the charm of “Turning “Turning Red” is the way it initially refuses to explain what’s happening to Mei, trusting the potency of its hormonal subtext and our ease with the whimsical story logic of the Pixar universe. Just as the color red has many associations, so the send their children to NTA. As a result, the film argues, other local schools, including including South Loop Elementary, became overcrowded. When members of the Prairie District District Neighborhood Alliance asked Chicago Public Schools to build a new high school, their request was denied. denied. So the group proposed that the city combine the two elementary schools and turn NTA into a high school. The students, staff and parents of the academy were outraged, alarmed and resolute. resolute. They said “no.” In many different ways, including — in the scene that opens the film — protesting outside then-Chicago Mayor Rahm panda functions, ingeniously, ingeniously, as both a symbol of adolescent awkwardness and a relic of the family’s Chinese heritage. Mei becomes becomes a panda whenever she feels intense emotion, and she can ward off the transformation by staying calm. Repress, repress, repress, repress, in other words — a lesson lesson that’s already been drilled into her for years by her overbearing mother, Ming (a terrific and unmistakable unmistakable Sandra Oh), and, by extension, her sensitive, stay-out-of-the-way father (Orion Lee). Not that Ming would describe describe her behavior — her strict policing of her daughter’s daughter’s academics and social life, her belief that everyone and everything outside their home is a contaminating influence influence — as overbearing. Shi and her co-writer, Julia Cho, play deftly if sometimes exaggeratedly with the figure figure of the Asian tiger mom, pushing Ming to an outlandish outlandish comic extreme early on when she publicly humiliates humiliates Mei after a misunderstanding. misunderstanding. You might scoff or wince at that moment (I did a little of both), which occupies occupies that perplexing zone Emanuel’s house. Shaw, who made “The Street Stops Here” and was a director and cinematographer cinematographer for the acclaimed series “America to Me,” grew up in Chicago. Fittingly, he became aware of NT As situation situation when he saw an elementary elementary school friend, Elisabeth Elisabeth Greer, post about it on social media. Greer took him to a meeting and introduced him to then-Principal Isaac Castelaz. “I knew it was a good story,” Shaw said. “But I wouldn’t be able to tell it without getting access. Isaac is a historian, and he wanted it documented, if only to help other schools in where truth and stereotype meet. But you might also appreciate appreciate the cultural dimension dimension that makes Mei’s mortification mortification so personal. Helicopter Helicopter parents and rebellious rebellious kids clash every day, but it’s specifically Ming’s Chinese-ness, her perceived outsider status, that gives her “psycho mom” reputation reputation such a sharp sting. While “Turning Red” has the fanciful, farcical complications complications you might recognize from other Pixar movies — supernatural twists, clever coincidences — its busy narrative narrative machinery is driven by the inordinate pressure Mei feels to keep her worlds separate. Here, the horrors of bodily transformation and the challenges of cultural cultural assimilation become one and the same. At school, Mei soon realizes realizes that her friends, far from being weirded out by her panda avatar, might in fact consider it, like, the coolest thing ever. At home, the big red monster must be suppressed, suppressed, along with her goofy personality and raging libido. That of course means downplaying her obsession with 4*Town, a boy band similar situations, so he let me film.” For two years, the filmmaker filmmaker had unlimited access as the academy fought to avoid becoming one of the hundreds of Chicago public schools shuttered in the last 10 years. Castelaz, along with parents Greer and Audrey Audrey Johnson, became three of the film’s main characters. But interviews with students students and scenes from the school and the many protests protests make the tightness of NTA’s community and its larger significance very clear. Gentrification, and the racism that almost inevitably inevitably accompanies it, has whose pelvic gyrations and confusingly punctuated moniker are clearly modeled on ’N Sync (N*Sync? *NSYNC?) at the peak of its early-aughts popularity. It’s probably not revealing too much to note that a badly timed 4*Town concert will factor heavily into the plot, or that the band’s songs are velvety earworms of the highest order. (Billie Eilish and Finneas wrote the songs; Ludwig Goransson composed the score.) There is something particularly pleasing about the harmony that “Turning Red” achieves between the lyricism of ancient ancient Chinese legend and the synthetic creaminess of teenybopperpop. But then, the conscious merging of Eastern and Western traditions is hardly incidental to Shi’s project. The influence of Hayao Miyazaki, a touchstone for more than a few Pixar artists, artists, can be discerned in everything from the Totoroesque Totoroesque dimensions of Mei’s panda to the oval shape of her toothy human grin. In an era that predates Snapchat, the blissful scenes of Mei hanging with her girlfriends recall the rainbow-and-glitbecome rainbow-and-glitbecome a hot topic in television television and film, but no other story has made that troubling troubling relationship so clear. NTA, a top performing school with an overwhelmingly overwhelmingly Black student body, faces closure because an increasingly increasingly white population has created overcrowding in part by refusing to send their children to a top-performing school with an overwhelmingly overwhelmingly Black student body. The need for a new high school is no doubt sincere, but the proposed solution reeks of racism. Classism too, but mostly racism. Shaw had a hard time finding anyone who would speak to him in favor of turning turning NTA into a high school. The two who did talked about improving the neighborhood neighborhood and ensuring that those who had more recently moved in — young families with children in particular— did not move out. “I don’t think they understood understood what NTA was, and what it meant to the community,” community,” Shaw says, “because “because it had been misrepresented misrepresented for so long, and they had never visited the school. NTA should be a model school, and instead, they were willing to close it down.” Watching this David and Goliath tale unfold is not always always easy — “I feel like we keep losing,” Greer tearfully tells the camera at one point — but if there ever were a school worth fighting for, it was this one. Greer and Castelaz joined Shaw at the premiere; they seemed shocked and overwhelmed by the applause applause and the number of people who approached them with praise and gratitude gratitude after the screening. “I have been to festivals before,” said Shaw, “but I wasn’t prepared for this. I’m just happy to see how the wave of emotion has affected affected the participants. They worked so hard, were so brave, and now they get to feel the love.” As for the ending, well, as Shaw said: “Thank God I was filming when it happened.” happened.” ter aesthetics of purikura photo booths. (One of those friends, Abby, recalls a cruder era of anime character character design.) The climactic action scenes owe something something to classic kaiju movies; the more lyrical moments — a dreamlike interlude in a bamboo forest, a scene of Mei’s panda leaping over the moonlit rooftops of Toronto — are pure wuxia epic. All these flavorsome cultural cultural underpinnings have been marshaled in service of familiar Disney/Pixar themes: the importance of finding your own way through the world, of learning learning to embrace emotion and relinquish control. The ending ending could be a rejoinder to — or a confirmation of — that passage from Amy Chua’s “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother” in which she specifically specifically derided the Disneymovie Disneymovie tradition where “the ‘good’ daughter always has to have a breakdown and realize realize that life is not all about following rules and winning prizes.” Those same Disney movies movies are of course teeming with bad moms (or at least stepmoms), a trope that “Turning Red” slyly turns on its head. In seeing both the villainy and the vulnerability in Ming’s outsize rage, it suggests suggests that mothers and daughters — good, bad and mostly in between—exist on a shared moral, cultural and generational continuum. There’s a lot to argue about there. There’s also the usual built-in Pixar contradiction, contradiction, namely that a company company that routinely encourages encourages us to abandon the pursuit pursuit of perfectionism continues continues to be run by some of the proudest control freaks in the business. That’s mostly a compliment, though not an unqualified one. “Turning Red” is a delight delight and, I suspect, an endlessly endlessly replayable one, though in its eagerness to clean up its own impressively impressively messy emotions in the final stretch, it falls short of the catharsis it’s aiming for. Let’s score it a solid B-plus.

But some progressives view the legacy of that time, with its more frequent police-citizen interactions, as oppressive for the city’s most vulnerable people. “I am the only candidate that has ever headed up a police department,” Caruso said in an interview, “who hired senior leadership at a police department, reformed reformed a police department, got it out of a federal consent decree and brought it back to civilian control ... hired 800 officers and dropped crime by 30%.” Records and interviews suggest that, while Caruso had an important hand in changes at the LAPD, his role was more nuanced, some of his accomplishments accomplishments more modest and the changes dependent on more players than the candidate’s narrative suggests. As Police Commission president, Caruso did not head the LAPD but, rather, led the panel of five civilians who ended Parks’ reign and helped make Bratton the new chief, a choice ultimately ultimately made by Hahn. He and four other commissioners commissioners set some department department policies, but the most critical civil rights correctives correctives were ordered by U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess. Rather than ending the judicial decree, the LAPD remained under Feess’ oversight for years after after Caruso left the commission. commission. The LAPD may have hired 800 officers on Caruso’s Caruso’s watch, but attrition meant that the force grew less, by roughly 370 officers, well short of the 1,000 increase increase the Hahn administration administration had promised. Crime did drop by 30% over four years, as Caruso claims, with experts crediting many factors factors — including the LAPD’s tactics, an improving economy economy and the gentrification of some crime-plagued neighborhoods. neighborhoods. Hahn appointed Caruso to the Police Commission in 2001. His most memorable moments as president came during the 2002 showdown with Parks, the department’s department’s second Black chief, whom Hahn had previously lauded for his insistence on high standards and for a marked drop in crime in his first years in office. By 2002, despite Parks’ persistent claims that his strong hand would improve the department, he took criticism on several fronts: for an increase in violent crime, for meting out overly harsh and indiscriminate punishment; for insisting he could guide reform, rather embracing the monitoring (including on racial profiling) profiling) that the city had agreed to conduct as part of the federal federal court order. Still, a furor erupted in early 2002, when Hahn announced announced he did not support a second term for the chief. Black leaders said they felt betrayed. Radio host Tavis Smiley called Hahn’s decision decision “a slap in the face of African African American voters, without without whom Jimmy Hahn would never have become mayor.” Parks’ allies said the mayor’s announcement tilted the debate against the chief, despite a City Charter requirement that the Police Commission make the final decision. Trump endorses 'Hillbilly Elegy’ author J.D. Vance in Ohio The backing was highly sought in the heated Republican Senate primary race. ASSOCIATED PRESS COLUMBUS, Ohio — Former President Trump is endorsing “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance in Ohio’s competitive Republican Senate primary, a race in which the backing could be pivotal. In a statement, Trump described Vance as “the candidate candidate most qualified and ready to win in November.” “We cannot play games. It is all about winning!” he wrote. The decision is a blow to Clarence Williams Los Angeles Times RICK CARUSO, left, then head of the Police Commission, which oversees the LAPD, prepares to speak at a news conference in 2002. On a 4-1 vote, the panel rejected Chief Bernard Parks’ bid for a second five-year term. Hahn, now a Superior Court judge, declined to be interviewed, saying he was constrained from discussing political matters. But one of his closest aides said he deserved deserved most of the credit for changing chiefs. Richard Drooyan, a former former federal prosecutor who twice served on panels examining examining the LAPD’s failures, failures, said in an interview that Hahn’s move to a new chief represented “a profile in courage, because Jimmy Hahn knew if he replaced Parks it could jeopardize his reelection.” Then and now, Caruso said the commission acted independently. Asked in 2002 whether he feared breaking with Hahn on the issue, Caruso told The Times: “What’s the worst thing that can happen, that I get fired? Then I get more personal time for my family and my business.” The conflict between Parks and Caruso became personal. The commission president accused the chief of providing misleading information. information. The chief denied it and countered that Caruso Caruso and other commissioners commissioners had merely followed the dictates of the mayor who, in turn, was bowing to the demands demands of the police officers’ union. Protesters shut down work at the Grove, the shopping shopping center then on the verge of opening in the Fairfax district. district. A leader of the Grove protest called Caruso “extremely “extremely smug and arrogant.” arrogant.” The developer countered countered that he would not give into “extortion.” The emotional tempest spiked when Caruso reportedly referred to U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) as a “bitch” when he met privately with a group of police commanders. commanders. The congresswoman had been planning a rally in support of Parks. Leaders in the Black community demanded demanded that Caruso be ousted. Hahn refused. Caruso declined to comment comment on whether heusedthe word. He calls the Waters furor nothing more than “a diversionary tactic, part of a strategy to undercut me.” If elected, he adds: “I look forward forward to working with the congresswoman.” The commission commission voted 4 to 1 to deny Parks a second term. “I took the slings and arPaul arPaul Vernon Associated Press J.D.

Villaraigosa.) Parks went on to serve 12 years on the City Council. Now retired, the 78-year-old Parks still speaks at length about the unfairness of the outcome. He says Caruso’s focus on ending his time as chief shouldn’t be viewed as a strength, adding: “If that’s your one major accomplishment accomplishment that you claim, then you’ve not done much in the last 20 years.” Connie Rice, a civil rights attorney who has closely monitored the LAPD for decades, said that Hahn led the way for the important change but that Caruso played a key role. “It took real leadership by Rick to shepherd that commission through that kind of confrontation with a very powerful chief,” said Rice, who has endorsed Rep. Karen Bass for mayor. “On a scale of leadership, I give him an H out of 10.” Though Caruso now touts the hiring of Bratton as one of his most important actions, he initially looked to LAPD insiders to fill the job. “It was ironic that he ended up supporting me, because it was my understanding he was not for me initially,” Bratton said in a recent interview. interview. Caruso said his thoughts shifted after more research, including a talk with former President Clinton. “Clearly, I was convinced that [Bratton] [Bratton] was the best law enforcement enforcement executive in the country,” Caruso said. Caruso also impressed one of his commission colleagues, colleagues, Silvia Saucedo, with making a variety of people people feel heard in public hearings hearings about the chief’s job. Even as some of the sessions grew heated, Caruso would give out his mobile phone number. “I was like, ‘Wow, Rick is for real,’ ” Saucedo said. Caruso’s campaign website website calls Bratton “the most transformational figure in the history of policing in the city of Los Angeles.” And Bratton has returned the compliment, endorsing Caruso Caruso as an effective manager who “talks the talk and Beatrice De Gea Los Angeles Times WILLIAM J. BRATTON, Parks’ successor, is confirmed confirmed by the City Council in 2002. He presided over more agreeable relations with overseers of reform. walks the walk.” Though many past Police Commissions were viewed as rubber stamps for the police police chief, the panel Caruso led in 2001 and 2002 acted more independently in some areas. The group moved to bolster the “senior lead officer” officer” community policing program, to limit high-speed chases, to replace the dilapidated dilapidated headquarters at Parker Center and to create an independent commission to review the department’s response to the Rampart corruption scandal. Jim McDonnell, a former top deputy to Bratton and later L.A. County sheriff, said Caruso “looked out for the cops, but always in light of what was best for the community.” community.” Experts credit L.A.’s crime dip during that time to a relatively strong economy and gentrification of oncedangerous oncedangerous neighborhoods. Bratton cited more assertive policing—using statistics to move extra detectives and officers into high-crime areas and focusing on the small number of people who committed the majority of offenses. A 2009 Harvard study, commissioned by Bratton, found that public satisfaction satisfaction with the LAPD increased, increased, with 83% of residents residents saying the department department was doing a good or excellent excellent job. The study also found that stops of pedestrians pedestrians and drivers had increased increased sharply over six years from 587,200 in 2002 to 875,204 in 2008. The Harvard researchers approved of the “quality” of the stops because because a higher proportion of those questioned were arrested arrested and prosecuted. former state treasurer Josh Mandel, investment banker Mike Gibbons and former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken, who have been in a heated race for both the nomination and for Trump’s backing in a primary primary that is less than three weeks away. On Thursday night, dozens of Republican leaders in Ohio mounted an effort to urge Trump not to endorse Vance following a report that said the former president was planning to do just that. Although Gibbons and Mandel had been leading in recent polls, officials backing backing various candidates had long conceded that Trump’s support would probably push his pick to the front of the pack. In addition to trips to Former state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) argued in an article in the Nation that the LAPD was in danger of mimicking the New York Police Department’s Department’s controversial “stop and frisk” policies. Hayden wrote that the numbers “point toward racial profiling profiling and a possible ticking time bomb.” Jody Armour, a USC law professor who focuses on racial justice, pointed to studies that showed that increased increased stops, similar to those in the Bratton era, did not lead to a decrease in serious serious crimes. But he said damage damage in poor communities of color was real. “A reservoir of resentment resentment grows and festers and it shatters the trust and confidence confidence that members of the community have in law enforcement,” enforcement,” Armour said. “And, most importantly, it does not make the communities communities safer.” Caruso said the crime decreases decreases of his era speak to the LAPD’s successes. “On the face of it, I think you want to have officers engaged engaged and you want to have officers making arrests for crimes,” he said. “But you want to make sure they are doing it in the right way.” As to Caruso’s claim of reforming reforming the LAPD, those around the department 20 years ago say the most important important driver of change was the court order, imposed after after the U.S. Justice Department Department concluded there was a “pattern or practice” of civil rights abuses by officers. officers. Drooyan, himself a Police Commission president years after Caruso, said the consent decree “made the Mar-a-Lago, the candidates and their affiliated super PACs have spent millions trying to paint one another as insufficiently loyal to the former president, who remains remains deeply popular with the GOP base, despite being impeached twice, and won the state in 2016 and 2020. Vance, in particular, has come under fire for old audio and since-deleted tweets in which he called himself a “never-Trump guy,” called Trump an idiot and said he might have to hold his nose and vote for Democrat Hillary Hillary Clinton in 2016. But Vance changed his tune, saying he regrets his comments. He has aligned himself with the former president, making frequent appearances on Fox News and former Trump stratedepartment stratedepartment accountable to the federal judge, more than to any other single person.” (Drooyan is supporting City Atty. Mike Feuer for mayor.) Caruso said he got the LAPD out of the consent decree, decree, citing claims by Bratton Bratton and others that the order order was largely fulfilled not long after he left the commission. commission. But that diverges sharply from Feess’ view at the time. In 2006, the judge angrily rebuked the department for what he found was the slow pace of reform. He extended the degree, finally handing oversight back to the Police Commission in 2009 before lifting the order entirely in 2013, eight years after Caruso left the commission. Another important duty for Police Commission members is judging whether police used force appropriately. appropriately. Regular observers of the commission viewed Caruso Caruso as a fair arbiter, willing to hold officers accountable when the facts demanded it. The commissioners sometimes saw their findings findings overruled, however, by internal LAPD panels known as boards of rights. Caruso argued that allowing civilian commissioners to be overruled by panels that included included LAPD supervisors “made no sense.” He continues continues to say the system should be reexamined. A central component of Caruso’s current public safety safety plan is adding 1,500 officers officers to a police force that now stands at about 9,500. Caruso’s campaign chastised chastised the “cowardly” L.A. City Council for temporarily cutting LAPD funding last year. While putting himself at the center of many past public public safety initiatives, Caruso now distances himself from others — notably his support support of sales tax and trash fee increases to pay for more police and a shift of more healthcare costs to city employees, employees, to stretch the city budget further. The businessman suggests suggests he was merely following following Hahn’s lead on the proposal proposal (subsequently enacted enacted under Villaraigosa) to raise the trash fee. Around the same time, late 2004, Caruso Caruso said he would spend his own money to promote a measure imposing a halfcent halfcent sales tax to hire more police. “This would be the best investment I could make,” Caruso said of the sales tax. “Being a Republican, I don’t like taxes, but sometimes you have to do it.” By a single vote, the City Council rejected rejected putting the tax on the ballot. Caruso, who registered as a Democrat earlier this year, now says he wouldn’t need to raise fees and taxes, or cut other services, to hire more cops. He says he would find the money by cutting waste in city departments, which he estimated at about 10%, or $1.1 billion. He also said his reforms would allow businesses to make more money and, thus, generate more tax receipts. Veterans of decades-long fights to expand the LAPD cautioned that a huge portion portion of the city budget is tied up in employee salaries, benefits benefits and pensions. “If it was so easy to find $1 billion in the city budget, someone would have figured it out by now,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, Yaroslavsky, who headed the City Council’s budget committee for more than a decade. “One ought to have a Plan B, in case they can’t find that 10 %.” gist Stephen K. Bannon’s podcast, where he has echoed echoed Trump’s rhetoric on issues such as immigration. In an interview this week, Vance told talk radio host Hugh Hewitt he wasn’t sure if Trump would endorse anyone anyone in the race but thought if he did, it would come before the former president returns to the state for a rally on April 23. “I think that he will. I’m not sure that he will,” Vance said. “He wants to endorse the person he thinks can beat Tim Ryan. He also wants to endorse a winner.” The winner of the May 3 primary is likely to face Democratic front-runner Ryan in November for the seat being vacated by retiring retiring Republican Sen.

I was on a slam poetry team with other young Black, Latinx, Tongan poets who taught me words like ofa atu (I love you in Tongan). We would meet in Ontario at our coach’s house below the railroad tracks, and he would teach us how to modulate our body and voice in relation to the content of the poems. I would also host huge spoken-word poetry readings with drumline, breakdancers and graffiti artists. I would paint and do street art on my own.

I drive along downtown’s streets and wonder which ones were made by chain gangs in the 1880s.

I see military equipment deployed against unarmed civilians at protests, and I remember that the first SWAT unit was created in Los Angeles in response to the Watts Uprising in 1965. AN-S: One of my favorite poems in “Diaries of a Terrorist” is “The Children in Their Little Bullet-Proof Vests,” where you discuss writing workshops for incarcerated youth in California. What struck you most about that experience? CS: Around 2011,1 was living in Long Beach and teaching poetry to incarcerated incarcerated youth at Los Padrinos Juvenile Detention Center in Downey. One teenage girl who was incarcerated there told me that her mom would bring home abusive men. She said that the courts didn’t believe her story. This teenage girl told me that as soon as she was released from Los Padrinos, she would try to get sent back. As we were sitting at a stainless-steel table, preparing to write poems together, this teenage girl said that it was safer to be incarcerated than to return to her mother’s home. When I think about the young people who were incarcerated at Los Padrinos, it challenges challenges the binary thinking of innocence versus criminality. The prison is not a place that protects “survivors” from “perpetrators of violence.” The prison is a place that is filled with survivors, whose trauma is exacerbated by the carceral state and whose needs are continuously ignored. When thinking thinking about youth in Los Padrinos, I am reminded that incarceration itself is an experience of chronic violence. AN-S: You work at UCLA and have organized with UCLA Cops Off Campus. Campus. What is the relation between the university and policing? CS: UCLA finances have long been tied to prisons and policing. From 2015 to 2020, UCLA paid $339,239 to Westlaw and $248,490 to LexisNexis. These companies provide ICE with data needed to conduct raids and deportations. deportations. Then there is the geography of the university that extends from the main UCLA campus itself, into the community community of Westwood, which is also surveilled and harassed by UCPD. And the university university has satellite facilities too, such as Jackie Robinson Stadium, which was used as a “field jail” during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. It has facilities such as Harbor UCLA Hospital in Torrance where a patient was shot and killed by a sheriff’s deputy. If we are thinking more in terms of knowledge production, then I think many departments departments at the university can be tied to perpetuating carceral logic. One example is the fact that Jeffrey Brantingham is employed by the anthropology department department at UCLA. He is the co-founder of the for-profit company PredPol, an acronym for predictive policing, which uses historical crime data (known to be deeply racially biased) to try to predict future crime. AN-S: How has language circumscribed and sanitized the conversation around critical issues such as immigration? CS: Prior to colonization, Southern California was one of the most linguistically linguistically diverse places in the world. There were approximately 90 Indigenous languages spoken in this region. Through the years this has changed but there is one constant: The settler state continues to make vulnerable Indigenous languages, languages, cultures and peoples. For example, example, Dr. Shannon Speed has a book called “Incarcerated Stories: Indigenous Women Women Migrants and Violence in the SettlerCapitalist SettlerCapitalist State,” where she writes about how Indigenous women migrating from Central America may be called Guatemalan Guatemalan and are spoken to in Spanish while being detained. This forced assimilation into Latinidad is especially troublesome for migrants who are, let’s say, Mayan and speak K’iche’ and may not be able to access translators while detained and in need. AN-S: How has L.A.’s carceral topography topography informed your emotional awareness of the city? CS: Carceral history feels very much embedded into the landscapes and buildings of Los Angeles for me. In “City of Inmates: Conquest, Rebellion and the Rise of Human Caging in Los Angeles, 1771-1965,” Dr. Kelly Lytle Hernandez calls Los Angeles the carceral capital of the world. People have been pushing back against police violence in Los Angeles for generations, and reform hasn’t worked. In 1992, again, the city was forced into an uprising after the police had beaten Rodney King. In 2020, again, after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the people of Los Angeles protested police violence en masse. Not enough has changed since then. The police promoted the beautification and the gentrification of Los Angeles with the forced removal of our currently unhoused neighbors at Echo Park Lake in 2021. The city hosted the Super Bowl in 2022 that brought ICE agents to harass undocumented street vendors — our hermanos that always make sure we have a good bacon-wrapped hot dog at the end of a fun night. I drive to work on the 101 Freeway and sit in traffic. The shadow cast by the Metropolitan Detention Center stands over me, almost reaching. AN-S: Elsewhere in the book, you write about hanging out with friends on the beach: “Police said / Are you drunk / Are you high / & We replied / No / We’re Salvadoran.” What do these lines mean to you, especially as they relate to public space in Los Angeles? CS: I think these lines exhibit how even spaces of pleasure and reprieve become the domain of policing. One goes to the beach and is afraid to drink a beer without without being accosted by the police. One plays the music too loud at a family gathering and thinks the police may be called to shut down the party. As a population, population, we embody the paranoia and omnipresence of the police, and then we begin to police ourselves, and then we begin to police others until there is no space that is left for us to dance and laugh in, without surveillance. There is an artist, Tourmaline, who wrote, “When we say abolish police. We also mean the cop in your head and your heart.” AN-S: What does your ideal L.A. look like? CS: In my ideal Los Angeles, we would return the land back to the Tongva peoples peoples and pay reparations. From Spanish to Mexican to American colonization of this land, policing has been used as an eliminatory eliminatory tactic to protect the settler state. It’s time to abolish the police.",5/21/2022,"('beautification', 'and', 'the')","('los', 'angeles', 'with')",[' The police promoted the beautification and the gentrification of Los Angeles with the forced removal of our currently unhoused neighbors at Echo Park Lake in 2021.'], The police promoted the beautification and the gentrification of Los Angeles with the forced removal of our currently unhoused neighbors at Echo Park Lake in 2021
569,2682865568,"HOWTO MAKE MALLS GREAT AGAIN ALEXANDRA LANGE WALKS US THROUGH THE HIGHS AND LOWS BY CAROLINA A. MIRANDA COLUMNIST llllllllllllllllllll I N LOS ANGELES, we find ourselves in a mayoral election that has become about malls. That’s thanks to candidate Rick Caruso, developer developer of glossy “lifestyle centers,” such as the Grove and the Americana at Brand, that have become talking points and press conference backdrops in the squeaker of a race against Rep. Karen Bass for L.A.’s top office. T Naturally, there have been plenty of questions about whether someone like Caruso, known for building semifictional utopias/dystopias of consumerism — remember those $1,000 dinners atop a moving moving trolley? — can govern something that is more than a simulacrum of public space. Malls are central to public life, even as they keep public life at arm’s length. Some may resemble town squares, but everything about that square is controlled — or, as the promotional literature likes to say, “curated.” That control extends to aesthetics, music and, of course, the selection of retail and dining options, which in turn control the class of consumer a mall attracts. Private maintenance and security help relegate the eruptions of city life—waste, homelessness, those who don’t adhere to codes of behavior — to the periphery. The mayoral race, along with a pandemic that is hopefully winding down, makes it a good time to think about malls and the purposes they serve. Enter New York-based architecture architecture critic Alexandra Lange’s latest book, “Meet Me by the Fountain: Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall.” Lange provides a smart and accessible accessible cultural history — outlining the social, economic and architectural forces that led to the creation of U.S. malls as we know them. But she also looks forward. The U.S. is currently “overmailed” — with exponentially more retail square footage per person than China or the United Kingdom. In recent decades, dead malls have proliferated, functioning as sets for zombie flicks and inspiring chroniclers of urban decay. (The hashtag #deadmall features tens of thousands of images on Instagram.) Lange, however, isn’t ready to declare the mall dead. BESTSELLERS Fiction rS 1.

Others have made comebacks in a different guise. Lange cites the case of Plaza Fiesta in suburban Atlanta, which began life in the 1960s as a strip mall, grew into an outlet mall and is now geared toward Latino immigrants. The mall features a single anchor store (Ross) while the rest is given over to Latin American market-style stalls that carry everything everything from quinceahera dresses to parts for Ford F-150s. “Meet Me by the Fountain” kicks off with a history lesson featuring characters characters who helped shape 20th century mall-dom. This includes L.A.-based architect Victor Gruen, whose firm helped pioneer the first suburban mall (the now-shuttered Northland Center outside Detroit), as well as the first enclosed one (Southdale Center near Minneapolis). Another star player is developer James Rouse, who helped turn Boston’s moribund Faneuil Hall into a tourist-friendly marketplace in the 1970s (as well as an early symbol of the SINGULARITY SINGULARITY is a science fiction story concerning the issues mankind will face in the twenty-first century, specifically Global Warming and what mankind has done to avoid extinction.

And, of course, there’s Jon Jerde, whose “experience” malls — including L.A.’s Universal City Walk and Horton Plaza in San Diego — gleefully mashed up the architectures of eras and continents in order to create “the most exciting visual narrative in the minimum quantity of space.” But “Meet Me by the Fountain” isn’t just a timeline of dudes with visions of malls dancing in their heads. Lange has a perceptive eye for how spaces are designed — and for whom. Her previous book, “The Design of Childhood” (2018), examined examined the ways in which children and their needs have influenced design. Last year, in a memorable dispatch for Bloomberg CityLab, she wrote about how public space fails teen girls. In the new book, Lange examines what malls have meant for women as sites of professional advancement and how mall design — with its broad doors, gentle ramps, plentiful seating and generous air conditioning—can make them hospitable places for seniors to socialize. She outlines malls’ conflicted relationships with teenagers, some of their most loyal customers. Over the years, Malls have beckoned them with arcades and Hot Topics; they have also chased them off with “No Loitering” Loitering” signs. “Commercial imperatives accidentally accidentally created an architecture that accommodates those who often have the least societal power: the young, the old, the disabled, and the poor,” writes Lange. As malls evolve, she wonders whether they can accommodate accommodate these cultural roles “with less ambivalence and more democracy.” A particularly intriguing thread in “Meet Me by the Fountain” examines malls’ complicity in segregation—de Cos Angeles Climes Presented by City National Bank AN RBC COMPANY WE’RE COOKING UP MOUTH-WATERING EVENTS THIS SEPTEMBER.

Mark Wickens CRITIC Alexandra Lange looks at the impact of malls such as Universal CityWalk, top, in a new book. Illllllllllllllllll facto if not de jure. In the early years, many suburban malls were only accessible by car, which frequently made them off limits to working-class Black and Latino communities. “In proposing a downtown outside downtown, protected from the elements, elements, ringed by parking lots, designed designed for a single use and rigidly planned,” writes Lange, “Victor Gruen had also created a mechanism to protect white, upwardly mobile homeowners from those unlike themselves.” themselves.” The white middle-class shopper, in fact, remains the idealized mall customer customer to this day. (Caruso’s malls are mostly located in upper-class, majority majority white enclaves.) This is true even for owners of malls that serve nonwhite communities. “The Black mall became Black not with intention but by default,” writes Lange. “Investment capital fled to chase white shoppers, and malls built for their use ended up serving the Black consumer ...private equity wants to make it back into a white mall.” In Los Angeles, that scenario is playing out at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Crenshaw Plaza, a mall that has served a Black customer base for decades. A Black community group, Downtown Crenshaw Rising, made a bid for the mall, but the owners ultimately sold the complex to Harridge Development Development Group, a luxury developer that wants to add apartments, condos condos and a hotel to the site. As Damien Goodman, who sits on the board of Downtown Crenshaw Rising, wrote in a letter to The Times about the sale: “Too often, modernization modernization is code for displacement.” The luxury arms race is not the only way to revive a mall. This is the topic to which Lange devotes the last chapter of her book—looking beyond the US. to malls in Latin America and Philippines, where they are booming. “To survive,” she writes, “the American mall has to shed many of the qualities that defined it for decades: decades: no department store anchor, less catering to an imagined middleaged, middleaged, middle-class white female shopper, more public transportation, more density.” Lange doesn’t have a false nostalgia nostalgia for malls. “Meet Me by the Fountain” Fountain” is frank about how they have usurped public space. But at a time when malls still serve the function of bringing us together, Lange’s book is a thoughtful guide to helping them do what the best of them already have.",6/19/2022,"('kos', 'angeles', 'aimes')","('downtowns', 'and', 'of')",['com/tastingnotes kos Angeles aimes gentrification of downtowns).'],comtastingnotes kos Angeles aimes gentrification of downtowns
83,2686544747,"Ignore TikTok. Here’s how to be a real L.A. Cool Girl ANGELENOS TAKE BACK THE TITLE AFTER A STRING OF SATIRICAL VIDEOS STOKED OLD TENSIONS BY JESSICA BENDA llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll C hances are, you’ve seen an L.A. Cool Girl. Better than that, you know an L.A. Cool Girl. Or, best of all, you are an L.A. Cool Girl. She supports the community community and she’s engaged with the city’s cultural roots. If you need to know a good Thai or burger spot, she’s your girl. She doesn’t take herself too seriously, kind of knows Metro bus routes and might still be living with her parents while in her 20s. If nothing nothing else, she’s unapologetically herself. At least, that’s according to L.A. County natives who are frustrated with how the socalled socalled L.A. Cool Girl has been branded recently on TikTok. The term can be traced back to a string of satirical TikToks that detail the L.A. Cool Girl lifestyle based on various neighborhoods. neighborhoods. Paired with filtered photos, they follow the L.A. Cool Girl’s fashion, dating life and daily routine to craft a West Coast Gossip Girl aesthetic. A TikTok of the “L.A. Cool Girl, eastside edition” featuring pictures of ritzy white women in Los Feliz struck a nerve, prompting so much backlash that the original creator, who is from L.A., turned off the video’s comments (it’s been viewed more than 670,000 times). Though the video included Los Feliz and Silver Lake hashtags, many of the critiques focused on gentrification and privilege throughout L.A., opening up old wounds in an ever-developing city The satirical version of the L.A. Cool Girl — a crystal enthusiast enthusiast who sips coffee next to celebrities and goes horseback riding in Anguilla like it’s no big deal — is elusive for many who grew up in L.A., and those locals have turned to TikTok to take back the title. Sign of an L.A. Cool Girl #1: She speaks up In a seven-story building in Koreatown, Raquel Santizo once shared a one-bedroom apartment with two sisters and her mother. Any lack of privacy was compensated by a strong sense of community — she knew the names of her neighbors, kids watched movies on the floor and she always felt safe walking down the street. Now 25 and living in San Francisco, things aren’t quite as they used to be when she returns returns to her birthplace. While the community and love are still there, the streets don’t feel as familiar. As a child, she watched the “lightning-speed” gentrification of Echo Park. Now she feels it coming for Koreatown. “It’s tricky to see something you love change,” Santizo said. “All I hope is that the residents who have been there for threeplus threeplus decades, like my mom, can still call home their home and feel safe and not get pushed out.” When Santizo saw the original original L. A. Cool Girl TikTok, she was quick to craft her own series of videos designed for a more diverse audience. While the original depicts a wealthier lifestyle, Santizo presents a life of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and art exhibits. She’s not an expert on the Metro, but she can find her way around, Santizo details on TikTok. She probably loves gold jewelry, wearing neutrals (but not in a boring way) and has a favorite taco truck in a gas station station parking lot. Chances are, the L.A. Cool Girl is working-class. “A majority of L.A. is, if we’re being real,” Santizo said. “A lot of us are first-gen Americans, so I think there’s some kind of pride in that and in essentially starting your own American story, community, identity within a city that is so frickin’ diverse and awesome.” Sign of an L.A. Cool Girl #2: She represents As these women revise the L.A. Cool Girl, they want to ensure she’s accessible. Often, being the reimagined Cool Girl boils down to simply being a decent human being. “She shares resources. She doesn’t gatekeep. She supports others. She doesn’t try hard because she knows who she is. She respects the culture. She’s healing from generational trauma, which I feel like is a quite common thing these days,” said Silver Lake resident Amanda Tovar. Tovar, 26, outlines accessible criteria to be an L.A. Cool Girl on TikTok, careful not to include include things that would require wealth. Like many Angelenos, she has struggled to pay rent before and can’t always invest in a pricy lifestyle. Her vision of the L.A. Cool Girl doesn’t require a heavy wallet. More than that, she doesn’t want the L.A. Cool Girl to erase the diverse community here. Tovar grew up watching Britney Spears, Mandy Moore and Cinderella Cinderella —which, while all popular, popular, were also all white. Tovar is Mexican Korean, and felt like she only really saw herself in a popular figure when the doll line Bratz came along in the early 2000s. She refuses to let the same thing happen to kids looking at the L.A. Cool Girl. “I just don’t want young people to grow up thinking that you have to be this one way to be a cool girl when you could just be yourself,” Tovar said. Sign of an L.A. Cool Girl #3: She’s concerned about gentrification Before the elote man was priced out of Highland Park and returned returned to Mexico, his loyal fans came to say goodbye, said Vanessa Acosta, a 32-year-old designer. They flocked to Figueroa Street to buy their last elotes and wish him well — and worried that, one day, they might have to leave too. Acosta, who’s called Highland Highland Park, Boyle Heights and Eagle Rock home at one point or another, has watched street vendors disappear, trendy new Photographs by Mariah Tauger Los Angeles Times shops replace mom-and-pop stores and families of color get evicted as transplants drive rents up. Before the pandemic, she and her fiance frequented a small plant shop owned by a Latina mother and her family. When Acosta returned after quarantine restrictions eased, it was gone. “White transplants who have way more money with that generational wealth are coming in and taking these businesses, retail spaces and even homes away,” Acosta said. “It just seems kind of hopeless. The people in this community and these communities have fought and tried to keep this stuff, but it’s just such a hard fight.” The fight has spanned decades, decades, but the L.A. Cool Girl has spurred fresh activism. Kathrine Braxton, a 26-yearold 26-yearold L.A. County resident with a B.A. in sociology, knows there’s nuance to be found within controversy. controversy.

If nothing else, the L.A. Cool Girl has cracked open these conversations on TikTok—or at least bundled them up in a hashtag. Braxton has seen the controversial aesthetic drive important discussions on a platform that isn’t always seen as deep. “The biggest thing that I don’t think people realize is that she did start a trend of people like me and other people of color who are reclaiming the L.A. Cool Girls for ourselves,” Braxton said. Sign of an L.A. Cool Girl #4: She contains multitudes The authentic L.A. Cool Girl is being reborn out of satire. And like Los Angeles itself, she’s multilayered. L.A.’s socioeconomic socioeconomic differences means she looks different to everyone, Braxton pointed out. The real L.A. Cool Girl is not someone to aspire to be — she’s someone Los Angeles women already are. “When I think of an L.A. Cool Girl, I think of the diversity,” Acosta said. “There’s so many pockets in L.A. There’s that cool girl in East L.A., there’s that cool girl in South Central, there’s that cool girl in Koreatown Koreatown or the Valley, or that cool girl in Glendale.

The report, obtained by The Times on Wednesday, provides the most thorough account to date of how Officer Officer Houston Tipping died, and comes after weeks of secrecy by Los Angeles Police Police Department officials, who have refused to provide details of what occurred. The report’s findings contradict contradict allegations by Tipping’s Tipping’s mother that he was beaten by a group of overzealous overzealous officers attempting to “simulate a mob.” An attorney representing Tipping’s mother has publicly publicly highlighted a laceration to Tipping’s head as evidence evidence supporting their claim.

By Alexandra Del Rosario and Kenan Draughorne T ony Dow, the actor actor who was best known as Wally Cleaver in the beloved 1950s sitcom sitcom “Leave It to Beaver,” has died. He was 77. Dow died Wednesday morning, his son, Christopher Christopher Dow, confirmed in a post on the actor’s official Facebook account. No cause of death was revealed, but Dow had previously been diagnosed diagnosed with cancer. “We have received confirmation confirmation from Christopher, Tony’s son, that Tony passed away earlier this morning, with his loving family at his side to see him through this journey,” the Facebook post said.

Add to that L.A.’s notoriously notoriously speculative real estate market, and corporate developers and fly-by-night investors have been circling. The risk of displacement has never been more real for longtime residents and business owners. And so, to turn his dream of community ownership into anything resembling reality, West has had to fight. Fight for financing. Fight to be taken seriously. Fight the slumlord who waffled about selling the building. Fight some of the tenants who had different ideas about how to proceed. And even fight some of the very Leimert Park residents he hopes to help. But late Tuesday, West and his business partner, developer Prophet Walker, finally caught a break. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed to launch a pilot program to help stabilize small businesses, tapping federal COVID-19 stimulus dollars to buy buildings along commercial corridors in gentrifying communities of color. The first recipient will be West’s nonprofit, Black Owned and Operated Community Community Land Trust. The $2-million loan, coupled with previous financial financial commitments from Wells Fargo, Snap Foundation Foundation and the nonprofit community community lender Genesis LA, will be enough to complete the $6.5-million purchase of the building on Degnan Boulevard. “Basically, there’s been a mountain of skepticism across the board that we’ve had to deal with,” Walker told me before the vote. “Now I think that skepticism skepticism has completely washed away. It’s inevitable.” Well, mostly inevitable. The supervisors instructed the county’s director of economic opportunity to vet the deal and relevant stakeholders stakeholders before releasing any funds. But assuming everything is on the up and up, this deal puts a crucial comer of Leimert Park in Black hands. In addition to West, in control of the land tmst are three of the seven tenants in the Degnan Boulevard building, including Adrian Dove of the Congress of Racial Equality of California, California, Ade Neff of Ride On! Bike Shop/Co-Op and Tony Jolly of Hot and Cool Cafe. That, in and of itself, won’t prevent gentrification. gentrification. The broader market pressures driving speculation speculation and sky-high housing prices in Leimert Park are likely to remain, give or take a recession.

Hussle encouraged his fans to build generational wealth in their communities. that gentrification from a position of power — and do it at the front end rather than after the fact, which is what too often happens in communities of color. It’s all about ownership. Done right, Supervisor Holly Mitchell said the county’s pilot program, which she created, will prevent displacement. “L.A. County is home to 1.3 million small businesses, close to 60% of which are owned by and operated by people of color,” she said during Tuesday’s meeting. meeting. “And we know that the rising cost of commercial commercial rent is a critical challenge.” challenge.” Under the program, none of the businesses on Degnan Boulevard — even the ones that aren’t in the land tmst — can be forced out. Rent increases are capped and some of the money from the loan will go toward making immediate repairs. Still, not everyone in Leimert Park is happy about the Board of Supervisors Supervisors blessing West and his land tmst. Rumors are swirling in Leimert Park about West, his character and his plans for the building on Degnan Boulevard. Some are predicting predicting that market-rate apartments are on the way. Others insist that the businesses businesses would be forced to close. Before the vote, one person even called to warn the supervisors that approving approving the pilot program would send “a message that developers can carefully come into any institution with a plan for redevelopment, redevelopment, legally evict those that disagree with that plan and move forward with gentrification of the neighborhood.” neighborhood.” Mitchell was unmoved and unbothered. Instead, she clarified that there no immediate plans to redevelop the buildDow’s buildDow’s onscreen brother, paid tribute to the actor with a Facebook post on Wednesday. Mathers praised Dow as “the kindest, most generous, gentle, loving, sincere, and humble man,” whom he had the honor of knowing for nearly 65 years. “Tony was not only my brother on TV, but in many ways in life as well. He leaves an empty place in my heart that won’t be filled,” Mathing Mathing on Degnan Boulevard. But even if that does happen, happen, the land trust would be required to provide commercial commercial and residential spaces at below-market rents. Plus, there would have to be “a robust community community engagement process.” Everything else is just erroneous speculation. “I was bom and raised in Leimert Park and Leimert Park has struggled for a long time,” Mitchell told me. “I have seen the closure of amazing businesses, and folks couldn’t pay the rent. There’s been a long history of conflict and I look at this as an opportunity.” For West, with the supervisors’ supervisors’ unanimous vote in favor of the pilot program, program, the hardest part is over. On Monday morning, the day before the vote, he sat hunched over at Hamn Coffee, across Degnan Boulevard from the building he will soon own. He was stressed out, fmstrated and exhausted. It shouldn’t have to be this hard. Across the United States, the average Black household is worth just 12 cents for every $1 the average average white household is worth. It’s a persistent gap that goes back to the decades of redlining and restrictive covenants that prevented Black Americans from buying property and building generational wealth. One way to close the gap is for more Black people to own homes. But another way, the one West favors, is for more Black people to own commercial buildings where Black-owned businesses businesses operate, as a way of anchoring and strengthening strengthening the economic life of Black communities. Hence, Hussle’s mantra.

The U.S. Federal Federal Reserve found that Black entrepreneurs are denied loans nearly twice as often as white entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, and when approved, pay higher interest interest rates. Knowing all of this has fueled West’s plans for the building on Degnan Boulevard. Boulevard. He wants to turn the building into a live/work, artist-focused complex with apartments, ground-floor commercial space and a rooftop restaurant. “We want to create spaces spaces where we can actually teach our community how to raise money and how to develop entrepreneurial programs,” he said. The second floor would have small retail spaces. It would also include small commercial kitchens so people who normally sell food on the street could try out a bricks-and-mortar space to expand their businesses. businesses. “I think it’s notable to create a space that’s designed designed for actual entrepreneurs entrepreneurs who’ve been out here grinding,” West told me. Any future plans to redevelop redevelop the building would require the approval of multiple people. But Walker, who has worked on several high-profile projects in Los Angeles, has no doubt it can be done and is excited about the possibilities. So is Mitchell. “I want us to own the Leimert Park Village,” she said, listing the many reasons reasons her pilot program is so important. “I want us to be prepared for the opportunity opportunity that the Vision Theatre, with that public investment, and the Metro stop, with that public investment, will bring to the businesses along the Crenshaw corridor.” corridor.” “Ownership,” she added, “is important.” Theodore “Beaver” Cleaver. The two fostered a relatable brotherly chemistry; as Wally, Dow helped younger brother Beaver understand the ways of the world and charmed viewers with memorable memorable one-liners. When best friend Eddie Haskell (Ken Osmond) asked Wally to tell his father that he’s a “big, stupid dope,” Wally playfully scoffed: “Don’t worry about it, Eddie. I think he’s kind of suspected it for years.” After the series concluded concluded in 1963, Dow appeared appeared in television shows including “The Greatest Show on Earth,” “Mr. Novak” Novak” and “Never Too Young.” Dow took a break from acting to join the California National Guard in 1965.

B3 Lottery .B3 Sale of Cathay Manor building opposed Marchers urge HUD to block transaction and rent hike planned for Chinatown site. By Connor Sheets For decades, living conditions conditions at Cathay Manor Apartments have deteriorated deteriorated as its elderly, low-income low-income residents have grown more isolated amid the rising rising rents and gentrification of booming Chinatown. Dingy hallways and rundown rundown communal spaces lead to modest apartments, many of which haven’t been updated in years. Clogged vents blow tepid, foulsmelling foulsmelling air. Malfunctioning elevators have repeatedly gone unfixed for days on end, leaving many of the vulnerable, vulnerable, mostly Chinese American residents marooned marooned on their floors. The 38-year-old complex on a busy stretch of North Broadway is a far cry from the gleaming luxury towers that have gone up across the neighborhood since the turn of the century. Yet its owners see it as a potential moneymaker. moneymaker. They hope to sell the federally federally subsidized housing complex for about $108 million, million, a high valuation for the area based in part on a massive rent increase that would need to first be approved approved by the U.S. Department Department of Housing and Urban Development. Advocates for the aging residents are raising the alarm over the proposed transaction. They are also voicing concerns about subpar subpar living conditions at Cathay Cathay Manor, which benefits from millions of dollars in federal housing subsidies each year and was built for $30 million financed primarily primarily by a 40-year federal loan. They allege that its owner, the Chinese Committee Committee on Aging Housing Corp., and its chief executive and president, Donald Toy, have neglected the building and its residents. The advocates are urging HUD to block the proposed sale and deny a request request by its would-be buyer, a nonprofit called Lutheran Gardens Corp., to raise rents to $2,700 per month, a hike of more than 146%. That increase would be paid by HUD — and therefore by taxpayers — not by residents, residents, who pay only a third of their income for housing under the federal Section 8 program. There’s nothing wrong with making a profit. But the concern is that allowing the sale of Cathay Manor on the proposed terms would reward reward its current owners for accepting federal funds for low-income housing while neglecting the property and its residents. “The finances of the sale do not hold up to scrutiny, and could obligate HUD to commit millions in public resources resources to bail out a negligent, negligent, abusive property owner,” representatives of the Committee of Chinatown Chinatown Coalition for Cathay Manor wrote in an August memo to HUD officials and members of Congress. Residents and advocates marched Thursday morning about half a mile from Cathay Cathay Manor to HUD’s L.A. field office to protest the proposed proposed sale of the building and rent increase.
