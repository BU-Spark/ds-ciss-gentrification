Then we learn firsthand about the hopefully hopefully temporary state of an airline that statistically has lagged behind its competitors competitors in recent weeks for delays and cancellations. My experience came in late September, when awakening to an email from American that said my 2:05 p.m. flight to Denver Denver in two weeks had become an 8:45 p.m. flight. Even by today?s flying standards, being delayed six-plus hours more than two weeks before flying seemed absurd. My call to the airline ended up being a lesson in navigating what the company is politely calling “operational challenges.? challenges.? An endlessly pleasant operator with a thick Texas accent told me that, sure enough, labor issues were the likely culprit, but that I had options. First, she said, I could have a full refund without a penalty. American also is offering refunds for any flights delayed more than two hours on the day of flying. Although no-strings refunds are a staggering thought these days, I declined. declined. I had scored a great fare and still needed to get to Denver. Well, she said, though I had been rebooked on that later flight, she would gladly get me on the 10:35 a.m. flight. The 4:10 was sold out, but I also could take the 1:55 p.m. with a layover in Dallas. None of those quite worked for me, so the 8:45 p.m. it was. Still, I would be flying six hours later than what I had paid for.

Its original building now flaunts an architecturally daring new entry to its fun, farout farout and refreshing exhibits. While Amsterdam spiffs up its museum quarter, the skyline across the water from its train station has a new focal point: the Film Museum, nicknamed “The Eye.” This striking and sleek modem building on the waterfront waterfront heralds the coming gentrification gentrification of the north side of the IJ, which is a body of water that separates Amsterdam from its northern suburbs. The building is a complex of four theaters and a trendy cafe with great riverside seating.

Along with its new and refurbished refurbished museums, Amsterdam’s JOE RAEDLE/GETTY PHOTO Although ?operational challenges? at American Airlines have led to some inconveniences, the airline is usually willing to make some accommodations, if you ask politely.

Two days later, I was told that I would be awarded 5,000 bonus frequent-flier miles. That’s no bounty, perhaps, but it seemed fair for the hassle. All this is to say: The airlines don’t hesitate to inconvenience us, but passengers have rights and, when things go wrong, often more options than it might first appear.

But there’s one major project that won’t be ready next year or the year after that: a new subway line. The North-South line, to open in 2017, will greatly expand Amsterdam’s limited system. And though it sounded like a fine idea back in the “Golden ’90s” when the project was started, better economic times are gone, it’s been riddled with delays, and today many think it is bleeding the city economically. The challenge is digging a subway tunnel under ancient buildings that stand on pilings driven centuries ago into the mud. In the Middle Ages, buildings buildings were made of wood, but devastating fires repeatedly wiped out entire neighborhoods, so stone became the building material of choice. Stone was too heavy for a foundation set in mud, so pilings were driven 30 feet through the mud and into more stable sand. (The wood survives if kept wet and out of the air.) Today’s Today’s biggest buildings have concrete concrete foundations that go down as much as 120 feet deep.

694,1949296897,"Director Kristy Guevara-Flanagan’s new movie takes a look at Wonder Woman’s evolution and Influence since her debut In 1941. The back story on Wonder Woman Nina Metz Chicago Close-up If comic book characters are a driving force in Hollywood, Hollywood, it?s worth noting that Wonder Woman, one of the most iconic characters of the last 70 years, has yet to star in her own live-action movie. She hasn’t been completely completely ignored. Two years ago, David E. Kelley teamed with NBC for a reboot of the 1970s TV series, which was roundly mocked from all comers of the Internet when production photos leaked online. NBC canceled canceled their efforts before the show even made it to air. Perhaps it was for the best The website Den of Geek got a look at the unaired unaired pilot and deemed it depressing; “She just exists and is still heartbroken over choosing to fight evil, instead instead of setting up home with Steve Trevor.” Well, now, that is depressing The character?s evolution evolution and influence since her debut in 1941 is the basis of the new documentary, “Wonder Women! The Untold Story of American Superheroines,” which screens twice next week, each show followed by a panel discussion with local comic book artists, including including Lyra Hill. “I think about sex and femininity and comics a lot,” Hill said when we spoke this week. “Wonder Woman definitely influenced influenced me even though 1 don’t follow mainstream comics. I’ve never read her comics, and I’ve never watched the show, but she’s important to me because she exists — and actually because of the story of her creation.” Bingo. If only the film had been about that and only that. Director Kristy Guevara-Flanagan does spend time exploring the Wonder Woman back story, but not enough, and the film often feels overly broad as it strains to make a larger point about female empowerment. The story of Wonder Woman’s creators, on the other hand — a threesome who lived in a polyamorous relationship — is a far more intriguing thread, left largely largely unexplored in the film. Officially, Wonder Woman Woman was the work of William Moulton Marston, a Harvard Harvard inventor with degrees in both law and psychology. Unofficially (and more interestingly), Wonder Woman sprang to life largely largely because of the influence of two women in his household. household. The first was his wife, Elizabeth, a career woman who was very much Marston’s Marston’s equal at a time, the 1910s and ’20s, when such a thing was rare. (Her degrees degrees in law and psychology psychology were from Boston University University because, as she later told The New York Times, “those dumb bunnies at Harvard wouldn’t take women.”) The final piece of the puzzle was a former student student and researcher named Olive Byrne, who was also Marston’s mistress. She moved in with the couple in the 1920s, and by all accounts it was a happy arrangement Each woman bore two children by Marston. Marston. (Their professional and personal lives sound as complex and fascinating as that of the Kinseys.) “Olive stayed home with the kids, while Mom continued to work,” Elizabeth’s son Pete told BU’s alumni magazine in 2001. “It was a wonderful wonderful situation, a win-win deal for everyone.” (The Marstons Marstons legally adopted Olive?s Olive?s boys as well.) During their time in academia, Marston and Elizabeth’s research focused focused on exposing deception. deception. It was Elizabeth who suggested they devise a blood pressure test based on the realization that “when she got mad or excited, her blood pressure seemed to climb,” (according (according to son Pete). That eventually led Marston to invent the polygraph, aka the lie detector test Suddenly, Suddenly, Wonder Woman’s Lasso of Truth seems very much of a piece with Marston’s Marston’s agenda He later constructed a personality test outlined in the book “The Emotions of Normal People.” Marston also put forth a premise that presumed women to be more honest, reliable and levelheaded than men: “When women rule, there won?t be any more (war) because the girls won’t want to waste time killing men.” The idea for Wonder Woman’s persona was slowly coming together. After leaving academia for a short stint at Universal Pictures, Marston gave an interview to Family Circle magazine (conducted by Olive — yes, that Olive — who kept the nature of their relationship concealed concealed from readers under the pen name Olive Richard). Richard). The piece ran with the headline “Don’t Laugh at the Comics” and it paved the way for a job at AllAmerican AllAmerican Comics (a precursor precursor to DC Comics), where Marston put his theories to work. When he talked with Elizabeth about creating a new superhero, she reportedly told him, “Fine, but make her a woman.” woman.” He didn’t need much convincing. “Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lack force, strength and power,” Marston wrote in 1943. “The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman, plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.” She was originally to be called Suprema before an editor changed her name to Wonder Woman. Her Lynda Carter appears In the documentary “Wonder Women! Women! The Untold Story of American Superheroines.? qualities were based on those of both Elizabeth and Olive (particularly Olive’s appearance). Then there is what I’ll call the “50 Shades of Wonder Woman” bondage bondage and submission themes. ‘?Marston believed that submission to ‘loving authority? authority? was the key to overcoming mankind’s violent urges,” according to the website Comic Book Resources. “That strong, self-realized women were the hope for a better future. Wonder Woman was very consciously Marston’s means of spreading these notions to impressionable young minds... (and) with this unusual brand of feminism feminism as his stated aim, Marston filled his stories with bondage (both male and female), spanking, sorority initiation rituals, cross-dressing, infantilism, and playful domination.” Boys, Marston said, would eat it up and then some: “Give them an alluring alluring woman stronger than themselves to submit to, and they?ll be proud to become her willing slaves!” Hill, who will be at Wednesday’s screening said: “What?s so interesting was that he wanted little boys to read this comic and feel that submitting to a woman was a positive and strengthening experience. To see woman as a dominant dominant gender was his view for world peace.” (Not surprisingly, Marston’s comics stoked the ire of certain segments of those including psychologist Frednc Wertham, who deemed Wonder Woman a threat to masculinity, among other crimes, in his 1954 book “Seduction of the Innocent”) Marston would continue to write for the Wonder Woman series until his death in 1947, after which the bondage themes (and Wonder Woman’s singular strength and equanimity) became less pronounced. As for Elizabeth and Olive, they remained together until Olive’s death in the late ’80s. Elizabeth supported supported the family with a job at MetLife that (along with Wonder Woman royalties) allowed her to put all four children through college and grad school. She died in 1993 at the age of 100. “She always said, ‘I’m not Wonder Woman,’” her granddaughter Susan Grupposo told her alma mater BU in 2001. “But I always told her, ?You are to me.’?

You wouldn’t go to Seattle now, would you? If you wanted to visit the American American community of the moment, you would visit, say, Portland, Ore. Haven?t you heard: Brooklyn’s compromised, compromised, edge-free; it’s Portland five minutes ago. That said, I remember relatives from Brooklyn, visiting us in New England when I was a kid, muttering muttering that Brooklyn hadn’t been Brooklyn since forever. forever. Certainly, it hadn’t been worth a damn since the schism of1898, when Brooklyn was eaten by New York City, becoming Manhattan’s Manhattan’s troubled brother to the east, a sprawl of mulchcolored mulchcolored warehouses in clay-colored neighborhoods, neighborhoods, dotted with parks, waterfront, ennui and battered charm. But to me it sounded romantic, like undiscovered country. Oddly, to tourists, Brooklyn has remained so — undiscovered. Though tourism to New York City has soared, from 45 million visitors in 2009 to 52 million last year, the bulk of visitors stuck to Manhattan. Yet, with 2.6 million residents, if Brooklyn Brooklyn were still a sovereign city, it would be the fourthlargest fourthlargest in the country, behind behind Chicago. True, six months after superstorm Sandy, some neighborhoods struggle for footing (particularly Red Hook); true, most New York City murders happen in Brooklyn (though across all five boroughs, the murder murder rate is at a 50-year low); and, true, Manhattanites who fled in the past decade for Brooklyn are being priced out (average monthly monthly rent on a Brooklyn studio apartment has hit $1,976). But you?re just visiting You’ve heard a lot of noise out of Brooklyn, and you’re curious: Is Brooklyn worth a trip the next time I am in New York City? With qualifiers, yes. In fact, consider the following a gentle nudge: Just as I used to think it was odd to meet people who had never been to New York, now I think it’s odd to meet people who slap Brooklyn.

681,1949419786,"FOCUS PENTAGON SPENDING How the Pentagon got in a food fight Commissaries would close to save $1B a year, Wal-Mart would fill the void; so what happened? By Rajiv Chandrasi:karan The Washington Post CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. - Motion Motion sensors and razor-wire coils ring the ammunition depot on this vast Marine Corps base. Sentries stand watch in the lobby of the headquarters complex. Military police officers patrol the barracks every few hours. But no building boasts the defenses of the giant, government-run government-run supermarket, whose bright, wide aisles are stocked with seemingly every brand of every food product available in America — Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer bacon, Lay’s chips — all sold at close to wholesale prices. The cost of ordering the goods, filling the shelves and checking out customers is borne by taxpayers. taxpayers. Three summers ago, Richard Spencer, a retired investment banker who serves on a Pentagon advisory board, proposed shutting shutting down the commissar)? at Camp Lejeune and every other domestic military base, a step that would save taxpayers about $1 billion a year. He called several large retailers to see if they would be willing to take over the markets. None were, but Wal-Mart, which has stores within 10 miles of most US. bases, proposed offering equivalent discounts discounts to troops, their spouses and their retired brethren. He figured other national chains would follow suit When the Defense Department bureaucracy that runs the commissaries commissaries learned of Spencer’s plan, it sounded an alarm among allies in industry and in Congress. A trade group whose mission is to represent companies that sell goods in military stores fired off a letter to then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, warning him it would be “ill-advised” to make major changes. Senators and representatives representatives dispatched similar missives. So did veterans groups. As the correspondence stacked up in his inbox, Gates summoned Spencer and other members of the Defense Business Board. “Richard, my fax machine is vomiting letters of complaint,” Spencer recalled Gates telling him. Worried that congressional anger would doom other Pentagon Pentagon cost-cutting initiatives, Gates told Spencer to drop his commissary commissary plan. The commissar)? fight was an opening salvo and a glimpse of the opposition in the next big war facing the US. military: confronting confronting the enormous cost of pay raises, benefits programs and other taxpayer-subsidized services, services, which have increased almost 90 percent since 2001 and have become the fastest-growing part of the Defense Department’s budget. budget. With Pentagon spending set to shrink in the next five years, senior military leaders warn that they will be forced to order reductions in troop strength, training and equipment purchases purchases if personnel expenditures are not curtailed. “We are on an unsustainable course,” said Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine Corps major general general who heads the Reserve Forces Policy Board. ?r We are trading off active-duty combat readiness to protect all of these benefits.” Personnel costs account for more than a quarter of all defense spending, the largest single slice of the federal budget after Social Security. Although no part of the Pentagon’s allotment is easy to cut — it is impossible to eliminate a weapons system or close a base without running into a welter of opposition — military pay and benefits will be among the most difficult to scale back. In an era when private employers employers are reducing health care and pensions, the military? continues continues to offer generous retirement benefits, including to service members who have never spent a day in combat. For troops who remain in uniform for 20 years or more, the military provides an annual pension equivalent to at least half of their final-years salary immediately upon retirement, even if the retiree is 38. Enrollment for a whole family in a military health care plan that is run much like a private health maintenance organization will cost a retiree $539 this year, about one-ninth of what the average nonmilitary family will pay out of pocket in HMO premiums. Booming benefits The cost of military pay raises and benefits programs, which have increased almost 90 percent since 2001, have become the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon’s budget and now account for more than a quarter of all defense spending. Here is a look at the types of compensation provided to active-duty troops and retirees, how those costs have grown and where they are headed. WHATTHEY RECEIVE Active duty ■ Salary ■ Food allowance (tax-free) ■ Housing allowance (tax-free) ■ Commissaries TOTAL OUTLAYS FROM THE MILITARY RETIREMENT TRUST FUND (In 2013 dollars) Though the number of new retirees each year is holding steady, those who already have retired are living longer, raising the overall cost of paying lifetime pensions. SURGING HEALTH CARE COSTS The cost of health care for active-duty troops and retirees is growing faster than that of any other part of the base defense budget. The biggest driver of costs over the past decade has been Tricare for Life, a program created by Congress, which offers secondary coverage to Medicare for all military retirees age 65 and older. In 2013 dollars Tricare for Life has driven military health care costs higher 2013: $51 billion 2020 2025 2030 medical personnel NOTE. All projections calculated by the Congressional Budget Office SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office, Defense Business Board, Department of Defense, Kaiser Family Foundation THE WASHINGTON POST BILL O?LEARY/WASHINGTON POST PHOTO Those on active duty also have bucked national trends. During the past decade, military military salaries have grown at a faster rate than those of civilian workers. The average enlisted soldier earns more than 90 percent percent of Americans who have less than two years of college. Most Army captains — the third-mostjunior third-mostjunior rank of officer — will take home more than $90,000 this year. That compensation does not take into account a raft of other services subsidized by taxpayers: commissaries, child care, schools on domestic bases, and morale and recreation programs. The tab for those will reach about $5 billion this year. Many active-duty personnel and retirees contend that their compensation and benefits are well-deserved, given the risks associated with a military career. “We’re not overpaying these folks by any measure. We’re not giving them a sweetheart deal on health care,” said Norb Ryan, a retired vice admiral who runs the Military. Officers Association of America, a 380,000-member organization organization that lobbies on behalf of active and retired personnel. “We owe it to them because they’ve put in decades of extraordinary extraordinary sacrifice on behalf of our nation.” But military leaders argue that they have no choice. Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary until February, warned last year that if the growth in personnel costs is not brought under control, “then we won’t be able to afford the training and equipment our troops need in order to succeed on the battlefield.” battlefield.” At current trends, the military’s health care spending will grow from $51 billion this year to $95 billion in 2030, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The military’s retirement system costs the federal government more than $100 billion a year. In two decades, the annual sum is projected projected to reach $217 billion. The benefits crisis is the result of more than shrinking budgets. ■ Free health care ■ Defense schools (on some bases) ■ Subsidized child care ■ Education (tuition assistance andGI Bill) Retirees are living longer, and health care is becoming more expensive. But the biggest reason, according to military leaders and independent analysts, is Congress, Congress, which has sweetened pay and benefits packages over the past decade, often against the Pentagon’s wishes. “Nobody up here wants to be tarred as anti-military, and they don’t want to say no to the veterans groups,” said a senior aide to a Republican representative representative on the House Armed Services Committee who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Those guys are organized, and they vote.” The commissar)- proposal, as envisaged by Spencer, would have provided a greater benefit to retirees. They would have received received the same commissary discount discount at large retailers closer to their homes, saving them from driving onto bases. “Nobody was going to have to pay more,” he said. “It was just a more efficient way to deliver the service.” The story of how the plan was developed — and how it died — is instructive, Punaro said, because “it shows just how broken the system has become.” When Spencer was a Marine Corps officer in the 1970s, commissaries commissaries sold basic staples on steel racks, much of it leftovers from the mess halls. Extra bags of pork chops. Loaves of sliced white bread. ?Subsistence food,” he said. The commissar)? at Lejeune now rivals the nicest US. supermarkets. supermarkets.

In 1990, the Pentagon decided to consolidate the separate grocery grocery stores run by the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines into a joint enterprise, reasoning that combining buying power and sharing overhead would reduce costs. A new bureaucracy, the Defense Commissar)’ Agency, was created to run the operation. The new management set out to transform the base stores into modem supermarkets. Pharmacy items were added, as were fresh baked goods and organic foods. Commissaries now stock an average average of 11,000 items. Because commissaries continue continue to sell goods at cost and everything is tax exempt, prices are, on average, about 30 percent less than at grocer)? stores offbase. offbase. Customers do pay a 5 percent surcharge to fund the construction and renovation of stores, but none of that covers labor and overhead costs. “It’s a tremendous deal,” said Jeffrey O’Brien, a retired Marine Corps master gunner)? sergeant who works at Camp Lejeune as a contractor. “There’s no way you’ll find stuff in town this cheap.” In 2009, when Gates asked the business board to find ways for the Pentagon to operate more efficiently, Bayer, the group’s chairman, turned to Spencer. Bayer needed to say only one word: “commissaries.” “It was low-hanging fruit,” Spencer recalled. Bayer and Spencer agreed that the project would not start as an official Defense Business Board venture — at least not until they came up with a credible alternative. alternative. Spencer limited his focus to the 179 commissaries in the US.

What he learned stunned him. The agency’s antiquated financial systems, he learned, are not compliant compliant with the federal government?s government?s accounting standards. Its workforce was bloated compared with other retailers. It refused to collaborate with the massive Defense Defense Logistics Agency, which buys food for mess halls, to get better prices. Spencer also discovered that the agency’s annual subsidy did not include other hidden costs. Commissaries don’t pay rent. Security Security is provided by military police. It didn’t take Spencer long to come to a basic conclusion: “Running “Running a chain of grocer)? stores is not a core competency of the Defense Department.” He thought about proposing that a private company be hired to run the stores. But when he called several large national retailers, including Wal-Mart, Costco and three grocery chains, he got the same response. “We don’t want this,” he recalled being told. Two days later, an executive at Wal-Mart reached out to Spencer with a proposal: The massive retailer would provide activeduty activeduty troops, their spouses and retirees with a discount equivalent equivalent to the commissary’s prices on the same goods in its stores. The company would apply the discount discount by scanning a shopper?s military identification card at the cash register. The Wal-Mart executive also sent Spencer data showing that the company has stores less than 10 miles from 70 percent of domestic commissaries. Spencer figured other retailers close to those facilities would agree to establish similar cashregister cashregister discount programs because because offering discounts to service service members and veterans would make them look patriotic. “It was a win-win-win plan,” he said. But Spencer never had a chance to make that case to Gates. Before he could work out the details, defenders of the status quo pounced. Spencer’s queries to the commissar)? commissar)? agency for financial data aroused suspicion. Fearing attack, the agency got the word out to members of Congress whose districts districts are home to large numbers of veterans — and commissaries. They, in turn, sent letters to Gates, telling him to leave the commissaries alone. The American Logistics Association, Association, a Washington-based trade group representing 250 firms that sell goods at on-base stores, wrote to Gates. Its letter was co-signed by the leaders of two other organizations with similar purposes, purposes, the Armed Forces Marketing Marketing Council and the Coalition of Militar)? Distributors. “Commissaries are core to the high standards of military quality of life,” the groups wrote. “They represent a reciprocal commitment commitment from the taxpayer to the militar)? people for their dedication dedication and sacrifice.” Patrick Nixon, president of the logistics association, contends that militar)? personnel should not be forced to shop for groceries in civilian stores. “The militar)? community is different from the rest of the nation,” Nixon said. “These stores are manned by people who are familiar with their situation, who appreciate what they’re doing for our country.” Nixon, a lobbyist, served as the director of the commissary agency agency before joining the logistics association. His previous employment, employment, he said, provided him with “firsthand knowledge of how valuable commissaries are.” Although Spencer’s plan intrigued intrigued Gates’ senior advisers, the incoming correspondence revealed revealed opposition. They’d have to take on Congress, powerful veterans veterans groups and some of the largest American companies. Spencer understood. “He had to pick his fights,” he said of Gates. Gates retired the following summer. His successor, Panetta, had been in office for less than a month when he received a letter signed by four dozen members of Congress. It put him on notice. “We recognize military resale benefits have been targeted with cavalier rhetoric by budgetminded budgetminded advocates questioning the need for the militar)? to operate grocery and department stores.” they wrote. “We would ask you to look past the rhetoric.” In April, new Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel sent his proposed budget for the 2014 fiscal year to Congress.

784,1949482096,"TEPRENCE ANTONIO JAMES/TRIBUNE PHOTO Actor Nick Frost, from left, director Edgar Wright and actor Simon Pegg collaborated on “The World’s End,” a story of six friends who reunite 20 years after a failed pub crawl to finish it. ‘World’s End’ stars battle the crawl toward sameness Christopher Borrelli did a celebration of friendship turn into a night of interchangeable, cherrywooded cherrywooded Lakeview bars and British soccer on flat-screens? “The World?s End,” the latest collaboration from British director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, best known for their classic “Shaun of the Dead” (2004), has a poignant, well-reasoned response: Body snatchers. “The World’s End,” opening Friday, tells the story of six friends who reunite 20 years after a failed pub crawl to finish the 12-pub binge they couldn’t finish as teenagers. But, really, it’s about body snatchers. In the original sci-fi sense — and in the larger, metaphorical, gentrification-is-afour-letter-word gentrification-is-afour-letter-word sense. Indeed, the film is yet another reminder that the 1956 film “Invasion “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” — the first of many takes on Jack Finney’s 1954 novel, “The Body Snatchers,” recycled in countless permutations, from the Borg to the Stepford Wives to Stephenie Meyer’s “The Host” — has become become the great American narrative. narrative. Or, now, a globalization parable A tale of individuality flattened. In Wright’s film, his characters become increasingly suspicious of the people in their small British hometown, who seem to say and do the same things, seem to have lost all idiosyncrasies and, when challenged, say that it’s better to relax and allow oneself to succumb succumb to the larger, easier conventional conventional wisdom. The “Blanks,” as the heroes call the assimilated, are not insistent but friendly, quietly influential. Scary, but funny. One of the great sight gags is how Pegg and Co., as they make their way through the pubs of their youth, realize the pubs have come to look exactly alike. And so it was with great irony that I met Wright, Pegg and Frost recently at a Streeterville Irish pub so alarmingly devoid of S uirks that at first I wondered if le film’s publicists, who picked the place, were being cheeky. Climbing into a semicircular leather tooth, the bright morning light streaming through the pub’s floor-to-ceiling windows, the TVs all showing ESPN, I said to Wright (unruly hair, youthful looking, albeit 39), Pegg (who had gone blond for a new movie, looked a bit like Tintin) and Frost (reserved and collected): “Well, here we are, in a genuine, genuine, well-lighted, glass-enclosed Chicago Irish pub... named D4.” Pegg “ ‘D4’ is not an Irish pub.” Frost:? ‘D4’ is a unit number.” Wright: “Still, you think they will ever make enough to reach D12? Then we’d have the Chicago remake of our movie. Though it would sound like a John Carpenter Carpenter movie: ‘We need to get from D4 to D12, right away!’ ” Frost: “D4 is the name of the Finally, Chicago, a movie that asks relevant questions. Like, why has your annual pub crawl gone stale? Is it the gentrilying neighborhood? Or the gentrifying keep? How Irish pub on the Death Star. Enlisted Enlisted Storm Troopers go there.” Before we move on, I should explain a couple of things. No.l: In defense of D4 Irish Pub ? Cafe on Ohio Street, home of a very tasty, coronary-friendly fried egg and banger sandwich served on a toasted New England lobster roll, the owner is a man named Brendan Brendan McNeill. He has a thick Irish brogue and explained to me later that his pub is actually named after the ZIP code of his former Dublin neighborhood. And, yes, his pub is toxlike, more right angles than cherry wood “But the Irish pub, even the British pub, is not as cloistered or dark as it used to be,” he said. “People ask me if this is an Irish { )ub, because they don’t see a eprechaun or shillelagh, but this is an Irish pub in 2013.” And No. 2: Wright, Pegg and Frost are culturally nostalgic, late-30- and early 40-somethings, relating everything back to a moment of their youth, when Spielbergian-Lucasian forces formed them into pop nerds. Wright turned to me. “Do you know pub crawls?” he asked. I’m familiar, I said. Wright: “The pub crawl is a quest By agreeing to do a pub crawl, you are saying to the universe universe that ‘I am agreeing to go into oblivion.’ Which is why the last bar in the film is the World’s End. There is no day after.” Simon: “ ‘Day After,’ directed by the same guy (Nicholas Meyer) who did ‘Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.’ ” Wright ?Right.? Pegg and Frost met first, through Pegg’s then-girlfriend; then they met Wright and asked him to direct “Spaced,” their hit Channel 4 series in the UK., which led to the zombie comedy “Shaun of the Dead,” the cop comedy “Hot Fuzz,” which led to success, particularly for Pegg, who is now Scotty in the “Star Trek” reboots, and Wright, who wrote Steven Spielberg’s “The Adventures of Tintin” and is set to direct Marvel’s “Ant-Man.” These are not the credits of gentrification warriors. Yet in conversation they are unrelenting on how much warmth and personality matter: railing (Pegg) against the recent remake of “The Evil Dead” for “getting the obvious stuff, forgetting forgetting the mischievousness”; complaining complaining (Wright) about a screenwriter screenwriter who suggested he snip the LAURIE SPARHAM/FOCUS FEATURES PHOTO Longtime pals Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine). Gary (Simon Pegg), Andy (Nick Frost) and Peter (Eddie Marsan) down a pint of beer in their 12-stop pub crawl In “The World?s End.” personable first half-hour of “Shaun of the Dead” leading to the first zombie attack “Which is wrong,” Wright said, “pulling the one part that makes it different” On the subject of pub culture, they’ve become borderline activist, activist, explaining pub names in the film — Old Familiar, Two-Headed Dog, etc. — had to be taken from real pubs in England, flinching as I mentioned a few Chicago pubs: Timothy O’Toole’s, O’Callaghan’s, Johnny O’Hagan’s. When I said the original plan for this interview interview was to go on a pub crawl, they shuddered, saying everyone wants a pub crawl with them. Wright: “I am a lightweight.” Pegg “And I don’t even drink! The thing we get all the time is, ‘I would love to go out for a pint with you guys.’ But, in reality, it would be terrible. It’s kind of ridiculous to do a pub crawl in the first place. Why not let the beer “You know, this movie, itTs based on something I did at 19.? — Edgar Wright, director come to you? When I did drink, I used to sit in one pub. A pub crawl would be an excuse to drink more than you should while disguising it under the banner of fun, like a land of project.” Frost: “Maybe stay at your favorite pub and ask them to install a treadmill?” Wright: “You know, this movie, it’s based on something I did at 19. I liked the idea of watching adults try to re-create something only students and young people should try. I never even made it through my pub crawl.” How far did you get, I asked. Wright: “Six out of 15 pubs.” Frost: “Or less than half a kilometer.” kilometer.” I asked if, on a four-week publicity publicity tour for a pub crawl film, they became students of American American pubs. They shuddered again. Pegg “In America, the pub is a different proposition altogether. You guys have bars. What pubs you have are sort of Irish or approximate approximate what England has. But it’s a cultural divide. This, for instance, is not a pub. This is a warehouse with chairs. A pub is a public house, you drink there, but it’s like a friend’s living room.” Frost: “A real pub, they hate you until they know you. They distrust anyone who isn’t a regular. regular. We ensconced at this pub in North London that became the basis for the pub in ‘Shaun of the Dead,’ and it was very close to our house. But we spent a good three years there before they got comfortable. comfortable. It was like getting chimps to trust you. You have to let them look at you, touch you. Eventually they warm to you.” Pegg “We became close to the owners, actually. So much so it was hard going anywhere else.” Frost: “Become a local, you realize that it’s you in the hotel photo at the end of‘The Shining’ Shining’ ” They laughed. Pegg “I like this conversation. The difference between a bar and a pub, in the British-American sense, is that in America, a bar is a place you go to drink. And you don’t see families in bars. At least I haven’t. The (British) pub is more of the social nexus. It has much more of a social, definitely community, meaning in England.” But, wait, I said, there’s no gentrification of the English pub? Wright: “Absolutely, there is! Our joke about them looking the same now is right Our pubs are being streamlined, like your bars. The rough edges are coming off. Even the sense of history, the beautiful old buildings, bulldozed. The signage, menus, all exactly the same. It’s sad. In the movie, our pub crawl is like an M.C. Escher trap, and that’s kind of right: Pubs, down to their names, once had a florid eccentricity. Occasionally, an actual historical link. Now it all seems pulled out of a hat somewhere else.” Pegg “Actually, what’s happening, happening, the gentrification, the rebranding, rebranding, is we’re watching the familiar neighborhood meeting place eroded by, arguably, the Americanization of the British high street. Big chains are trying to re-create the pub and entice families back, and, as a result, the pubs become McDonald’s.” Even where you live, I asked? Pegg “Absolutely, but you —” he points at Frost — “you still have nice ones near you.” Frost: “I do. I live in a place called Twickenham (a former 1 suburb, south of central London), and I have counted the pubs there, and there are exactly 21 in town. People don’t go to the homogenized homogenized ones. The thing is, we have a sports stadium in town. Holds 85,000. They play rugby there. Even bad pubs are bursting at the seams on game days. It’s how they survive. Outside those matches, the locals don’t go.” You guys realize that you’ve made three films now about fear of losing one’s identity? I said. Wright: “Or growing up or losing perpetual adolescence or being scared that you are going to miss something you think you can’t do without I look in my suitcase... it reminds of me how little I need! How many books and DVDs I thought I couldn’t live without when I was younger don’t mean anything at this age. It’s a fear of losing what you think made you unique, becoming part of a homogenizing system.” Pegg “I think that’s true. But just as crucially, what you’re talking about is being British. We are a small island in the North Sea. A minority community, in a way. Something about being British leaves one feeling always under siege, expecting to be subsumed subsumed by American culture. It’s not a criticism. England embraces the dominant culture. I’m in ‘Star Trek,’ Edgar is doing a Marvel movie, Nick did ‘Tintin’ and ?Snow White and the Huntsman,’ all willingly. But being British, we feel on the fringe, always about to be gentrified.” Wright jumped in. “Perhaps I should say something something to the people of Chicago,” he said, directly into my recorder. He cleared his throat. “People of Chicago, please enjoy our movie and prepare to make us feel welcome when our country is underwater in 20 years. In return, when we arrive here in boats, we promise to enjoy all of your fake Irish pubs.” cborrelli@tribune.com Twitter @borrelli Borrelli e-book “Artists, Obsessives and Chicago Originals,? a collection of Christopher Borrelll?s best profiles, Is available for purchase at chlcagotrlbune.com/ebooks (free to dlgltalPLUS members).",8/18/2013,"('there', 's', 'no')","('the', 'english', 'pub')","['” But, wait, I said, there’s no gentrification of the English pub?

537,1949661353,"A return to blue-collar Lincoln Park Nina Metz Chicago Close-Up Midway through the 1974 documentary “Now We Live on Clifton,” which captures the early gentrification of Lincoln Park, a group of boys fling themselves off the roof of a house down onto a flimsy mattress. The diversion has “broken ankle” written all over it, but no one seems worse for wear. ?That’s one of my favorite scenes in the movie,” co-director Jerry Blumenthal said when I reached him this week. He describes Lincoln Park in those years as a “down-and-dirty inner-city neighborhood.” Even so, an old mattress left abandoned like that in an empty lot next to someone?s garage was unusual. ?But it was OK. It wasn’t the end of the world. It was a place for the kids to jump off the roof and test their courage. That’s what urban neighborhoods are all about.” You don’t see preteens left to their own devices in quite the same way any more. The 26minute 26minute documentary screens Sunday in a program of 16 mm films called “Vanishing Neighborhoods,” Neighborhoods,” curated by the Chicago Chicago Film Archives. It’s a real find. The lineup also includes “Good Night, Socrates” (34 minutes), a black-and-white educational film from 1962 that looks at the residential residential upheaval in Greektown when immigrant families were edged out to make room for expressways and the University of Illinois at Chicago. It’s a staged documentary of sorts, with narration that lays it on thick. Though formal and occasionally a bit hokey, there’s footage here that captures the imagination, such as the noisy coffeehouse where the floors are hardwood and the conversation centers on politics and Turkish coffee. “It was a w r orld of men.” the narrator intones. “A world of which I was not yet a member. A world I would be expected to join.” Well, not in this particular location, at any rate. The tliird film in the program is 1968’s “A Place to Live,” a 28minute 28minute industrial film from the city’s Department of Urban Renewal. Renewal. Rethinking blight is the overall message. Initially you wonder if the film might be something something of a spin job. Architecture critic Lee Bey wrote about the doc last year on his blog for WBEZ: “The city of Chicago in 1968 had to know what people — particularly black people — were calling urban renewal then: Negro removal.” Filmmaker DeWitt Beall was in no hurry to sweep that subtext under the carpet, though he does feature white people affected as well: “Each year, 3,000 families Other venues BACinema Beverly Arts Center 2407W.mthSt. 773-445-3838 beverlyartcenter.org “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom” ★★★ (U.K./South Africa; Justin Chadwick. 2013) The work of British actors Idris Elba and Naomie Harris as Nelson Mandela and his second wife.

It is an early work from Kartemquin Films (the production company that is home to Steve James, director director of the new Roger Ebert documentary, ‘?Life Itself”), and it chucks the omniscient narrator altogether and lets the kids — 10-year-old Pam, her 12-year-old brother, Scott, and their pals Wally and Mario — tell their own story. “Kartemquin was this fledgling group,” Blumenthal said. “Some of us had come up from Hyde Park out of an academic world that was not very welcoming to the land of thing that we wanted to do. They wanted to see sociological sociological studies that were very quiet and middle-of-the-road and objective. And we wanted to do films that advocated change and taking a new look at the world.” Economic shifts were just starting to affect Lincoln Park. ?It had been a very gritty, workingclass workingclass neighborhood that was in some ways gang-infested in the ’50s and ’60s and was now being gentrified in a gentle but nonetheless nonetheless insidious way,” Blumenthal Blumenthal said. “That was haring an impact on a lot of families who came from that working-class stock, who made the neighborhood neighborhood what it was.” The kids are seen roughhousing. roughhousing.

We’ve usually heard about gentrification as a good news/bad news urban urban story in recent decades. Depressed neighborhoods have found new vigor as numerous low-income renters are sent packing like urban nomads. Now it’s happening among the people who talk about food the way that Bill Hader?s Stefon character on ?Saturday Night Live” reveals the latest u^trahip nightclub. MICHAEL TERCHA/TRIBUNE Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis dropped her widely anticipated run for mayor because of health reasons. BRIAN CASSELLA/TRIBUNE Mayor Rahm Emanuel had trailed Lewis in several polls. and talent while returning generally mediocre results, as critics claim? Or is it providing bracing and innovative competition that improves individual and overall educational “Collards Are the New Kale,” raved a January headline in a Whole Foods blog, which is a great food chain if you’re not worried about prices. The headline has since turned up in promotional signs in Whole Foods stores. Can it be? It seemed like only yesterday, although actually it was July 2012, that fashion writer and author Derek Blasberg tweeted, “What’s the biggest biggest trend in fashion right now? Kale. Yes, I’m talking about the vegetable. It’s so hot right now.” Ah, when the smart set came for the kale, I said nothing. I was not a fan of kale. But now they’re coming coming for the collard greens. That hits closer to home. I grew up on collard greens, whether I wanted to or not. In our household, as in countless other African-American African-American families, collards were a basic food group all by themselves. I ate greens at home, in church basements and in other people’s homes cooked into soups or stews with butter, tomatoes and spices or simply as a side dish — with or without com braid. • ? ??■  outcomes, as supporters argue? It appeared that Emanuel Emanuel was already trying to blunt the issue somewhat when, the week before Lewis was hospitalized, a GETTY PHOTO The chic crowd suddenly thinks collard greens are cool. And ironically I hated greens. Being forced to eat them only motivated me to get a good education so that someday I could afford to avoid them forever. Little did I expect that, as a young reporter in the 1970s, collard greens, chitterlings chitterlings (properly pronounced pronounced “chit’lins,” y’all,) and other “soul food” from which I had liberated myself myself would become all the rage in mainstream America, America, which, to me, was what the media called white folks. As one of the few African-American African-American reporters in the newsroom, rfound ABEL URIBE/TRIBUNE Cook County head Toni Preckwinkle has said she won?t run. Chicago Public Schools spokesman announced that the district won’t be accepting accepting new proposals for charters charters for the 2015-16 school year (though two already under consideration might myself assigned occasionally occasionally to report, review and, essentially, explain soul food restaurants to our predominantly white audience. audience. I grew to love greens. My taste buds had matured. Besides, this time I was getting paid for it. Now, decades later, collard collard greens are coming back as a thoroughly mainstream mainstream “Southern dish.” But not everybody’s pleased. For example, on Columbus Day, writer Diamond Sharp at the black-oriented The Root website listed collard greens among “8 Things That Have Been ‘Columopen ‘Columopen in the fall). Yes, there was a bit of “let’s you and him fight!” in how some of us were trying to egg Lewis into the race (including my Feb. 21 column column “Run. Karen, run!”). A bused’ This Year” — meaning meaning fixtures of black America America that suddenly have been “discovered” by mainstream mainstream America. Other examples from Sharp included “bae” as a term of endearment, Timberlands as a fashion statement and twerking, the dance craze that Miley Cyrus may have destroyed with her notorious “MTV Video Music Awards” appearance. But Mikki Kendall, a black feminist writer who tweets as Kamythia, is concerned about more than mere cultural hijacking. Credited with creating the hashtag #FoodGentrification, #FoodGentrification, she has raised alarm bells about a trend that, as she writes in The Grio website, “may well put traditional meals out of reach for those who created created the recipes.” She has a point. Cuts in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) food stamp benefits, benefits, even as wages have stagnated for lower-income workers, puts low-income families in an even tighter squeeze to buy nutritious fopd. But Ryan Cooper, who political donnybrook is great theater, great material for the media. But it’s also great civics, as I argued all along. Hardfought Hardfought campaigns are when incumbents have to answer the concerns of the voters and when challengers get a chance to prove that they have better ideas. Should Chicago keep opening new charters, headed toward a goal of nearly 200 such schools by 2017, even as it’s closing underutilized traditional schools? A Tribune poll taken in early August found 72 percent of 800 registered voters surveyed said no and only 18 percent said yes. Nearly two-thirds said they disapproved of Emanuel’s Emanuel’s handling of school issues. But now, so what? Yes, Aid. Bob Fioretti, 2nd, and municipal development consultant Amara Enyia, the two most prominent remaining mayoral hopefuls, hopefuls, are calling for a moratorium moratorium on charters. But even combined they don’t look to have what it will take even to begin turning this election into referendum on Emanuel’s policies — not only on education but also on crime, development (really, a new basketball arena for DePaul?) and traffic enforcement. enforcement. That same Tribune poll showed two-thirds of Chicago Chicago voters don’t like the red light camera system, and that Emanuel’s overall job approval rating has fallen from 50 percent in 2013 to 35 percent in 2014. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Preckwinkle, a skeptic on charter schools who docs have what it will take to haul Emanuel into the court of public opinion, has been emphatic, even after Lewis’ health setback, in saying she’s not going to enter the mayoral race. I’m not saying she’d be a better mayor than Emanuel. Emanuel. I’m saying I’d like to see Emanuel have to make his case for re-election. Run, Toni, run! Hey, it worked once before. Twitter @ericzom Comments on this column: chicagotribune.com/zom writes for TheWeek.com, argues with charts and graphs that other factors, such as drought, crop failures, failures, increased worldwide demand and deregulation of Wall Street speculators in commodities futures, have a much bigger impact. No doubt. I think history shows the appropriation of various ethnic cultural creations into the mainstream mainstream is as old as the American melting pot, which I prefer to call a Mulligan stew. Every community community contributes some flavor to the pot, just as every community absorbs the flavors of others. That’s how we got rock n? roll, among other potboilers. But the notion of “food gentrification” highlights a much larger problem that afflicts low-income families. families.

31,1949968472,"Why chefs obsess over food awards By Christopher Borrelli Tribune reporter Until recently, I was a voting member of the James Beard Foundation, which gives out a number of highly valued annual awards to chefs and restaurants. And yet I was not a very active member; certainly, while eating out, membership never came up. Restaurants never seemed particularly particularly aware: I can’t recall a time being treated egregiously well. Alinea never left extra garlic bread. The other day, however, now shorn of influence, I had a power fantasy while eating at a restaurant with clear pretense toward a Beard award or Michelin Michelin star. It was brunch. My dish came with an over-easy egg. But since it was brunch, at the risk of upsetting the integrity of the dish, I asked for my egg scrambled. Not possible, the server said. You don?t scramble eggs, I said. Sony?, she said. Why? I asked. The server went away, then returned: The chef can’t scramble the egg because the chef is not “set up for that.” Which was code for: The chef doesn’t want to scramble the egg because, if he did, the dish would have a scrambled egg. I was more amused and impressed than annoyed, annoyed, but also briefly daydreamed of bringing bringing the whole place to a standstill by pretending pretending to be a Beard member. Or a Michelin Michelin critic. Or better, I pick Food ? Wine’s best new chefs list. Of course, no journalist worth a damn would do that But if I had... scrambled eggs. Sure, there are those chefs with self-esteem who would never buckle before a philistine, who might even take any request as a test of their integrity, delivered to a control-freak chef by a clandestine clandestine critic. And yet, if there is anything that many an ambitious, unbendable chef — particularly one with a large ego — is worried about, it’s awards, best-of lists, who has one Michelin star, who has two Michelin stars, why does this gastronomic toilet receive a Beard and this castle of innovation innovation get ignored. Chefs are obsessed obsessed with validation the way Harvey Weinstein is obsessed with wnning Oscars. Ches have become so preoccupied preoccupied wth chasing accolades that there a e restaurants now that seem like the food equivalent of Oscar bait, sprung less from a fresh idea or need to do something something vital than an eagerness to be competitive. “Or,” said Sarah Freeman, a food writer best known as the Chicago editor for the Zagat food guides, “maybe it’s not so much the restaurant is designed to win awards, but the awards seem designed to recognize recognize a certain kind of restaurant. It becomes a circular thing. A chef being pushed to do their best work isn’t necessarily a bad thing for consumers, of course.

In the next few days, Chicago gets a gala dinner to celebrate the 2015 Michelin Guide (presumably attended by the 25 local chefs who landed at least one star); on Friday, in New York, the Beard Foundation hosts a gala dedicated to the late Charlie Trotter, who received two Michelin stars and 12 Beards during his career. Michelin’s Bib Gourmands, the runner-up nods to restaurants that fall shy of stars, were announced announced last week and noted 59 local establishments. The organization’s organization’s stars were awarded to 24 restaurants Tuesday. And there are myriad end-of-year lists. In May, the Beard Awards will be held in Chicago (its first step outside New York in the ceremony’s ceremony’s 25-year history). And in January, the Jean Banchet Awards for Culinary? Excellence, given by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Foundation. A year ago, Freeman was brought in to help gather highcaliber highcaliber chefs for the Jean Banhave Banhave become so key to the identity of the high-end chef that no less than Gordon Ramsay, arguably everyone’s contemporary contemporary go-to image of the intense chef, told a Norwegian TV show earlier this year that losing two of his Michelin stars in 2013 resulted resulted in a crying jag. “It’s like losing a girlfriend,” he said. “You want her back.” Don’t weep for Ramsay: He still holds 14 stars for 12 restaurants. Fret, instead, oh, for Phillip Foss, chef-owner of tiny El Ideas on West 14th Street. The restaurant recendy received one Michelin star. Foss admitted that he would “curl into a fetal position” if he were to lose that star in 2015. He said: “I’m not going to tell you I’m not obsessed with this stuff. But there is no better way to know how we compare to other restaurants. restaurants. I hate it, I absolutely hate that I care about it and I hate the not knowing what I could do to effect any change. I hate the obsession. obsession. The Bristol, they don’t get a Bib, everyone assumes they’re getting a star, they don’t get a star.” For his part, chef Chris Pandel of The Bristol said he is not obsessive: obsessive: “We ask ourselves all the time why we didn’t get a Bib or star. There are a million answers, and I couldn’t tell you what the right one is.” Because awards are subjective. There are no check boxes of do’s and don’ts. But in a practical sense, say you are a chef starting out or an established chef mainchets. mainchets. “The award component of the event is important,? she said, “but this is a charity event, and I have had to remind chefs of that. I have found myself saying: ‘No, I can’t guarantee you will win an award if you cook for the gala.’... Some only want to cook if they’re nominated.” Awards and stars BRIAN CASSELLA/TRIBUNE 2013 Phillip Foss, chef-owner of tiny El Ideas, said that he hates that he cares so much about the Michelin ratings JOHN J. KIM/TPIBUNE 2013 Bruce Sherman of North Pond said that awards can, provide motivation. taining your status: Accolades can attract business, separate you from the pack or merely keep you relevant Rich Melman of the Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group said: “The problem of high-end dining is getting people in the door. Food can be worked out, but having customers covers a lot of sins in this business, and if you are a kid, these awards get people in the door. You can’t fault them for being obsessive.” Which is a healthy point. But then, Melman Melman just announced he is closing L20, his two-star restaurant in Lincoln Park; it was “not making lots of money, not losing lots.” He just wanted to do something new; it never occurred to him that he was closing a two-star spot, only that he had a better idea. That’s called the long view; Melman has owned restaurants since the Nixon administration. Acclaim comes and goes. For a young chef like Iliana Regan of Elizabeth Restaurant, which earned its first Michelin star last fall, the past year has been about trying to figure out what a restaurant has to do to gather more acclaim. She wants two stars the way Gollum wanted that ring. “Awards are not a motivating motivating factor for why I cook,” she said, ‘hut it drives competition, so Michelin is on my mind. All day, all night, all year. Every customer who comes in, I tell staff ‘Probably ‘Probably Michelin.’ Romantic relationships, relationships, walking down a street, I suddenly think out loud: ‘And another tiling about Michelin...’ Michelin...’ I’m convinced the health department, FBI and Michelin have spy cameras in my place.” She said her star resulted in a “pop-in business,? so the fretting is justified: “In the past year I have been to several tw o-star Michelin places around the country, trying to figure out what two stars mean.? And? “Cleanliness in the presentation? presentation? On-point seasoning? I have no idea. But worrying: It affects your brain.” The upside of awards, presumably, presumably, is better food, more innovation, better service; if a good restaurant has no idea who you are, you are an honor-inwaiting. honor-inwaiting. “Awards can be a great carrot for a restaurant,” said Bruce Sherman of North Pond whose inability to land a Michelin star until this year struck many food watchers as a grave oversight — but the dowmside, he added, “is when acclaim becomes a confirmation confirmation of your genius.” There’s also the potential gentrification of fine-dining (the tweaks made to conform to a better rating); the chefs who grow more businessoriented. businessoriented. Michelin itself, a decade decade ago, warned against what one of its critics described as chefs innovating for the sake of innovating, not the sake of customers. customers. Not a bad lesson. Earlier this year, the restaurant 42 grams opened in Uptown. Chef Jake Bickelhaupt had worked at Alinea and Charlie Trotter. He dreamed of haring a similarly accomplished restaurant. restaurant. “I have come to a realization realization to just dedicate myself to guests, because the rest is out of my control,” he said, day s before the announcement that his restaurant restaurant received two Michelin stars. Or as Andrew Zimmerman of the one-star Sepia put it: “You le«m to understand that you never know how long the praise will last anyway.” Next year is the 10th anniversary anniversary of Alinea, a three-star Michelin Michelin experience. Nick Kokonas, the co-owner, tells a story: The restaurant had been open less than two years when Gourmet magazine declared it the best restaurant in the country. “Grant (Achatz, its celebrated chef) called and told me. T said right away: ‘It’s too soon.’ And Grant said, ‘Dude, let me enjoy it.’ ” But Kokonas was right: The cycle of a great restaurant’s rise and decline decline was coming much too quickly. A decade on, the restaurant restaurant is planning a redesign of its dining room sometime next year. “Our theory,” Kokonas said, “is that at some point, no matter how good you are, you (end up with) your grandparents’ living room. At some point, the experience experience feels old. We’re not there, but once you are, it’s already too late.” It has nothing to do with retaining retaining those stars, he said. “Our Michelin doesn’t even hang for the public to see. It hangs in the kitchen, for our cooks to see. Because we have a three-star kitchen, and what there are only 90 three-star kitchens in the entire world, I guess.” cborrelha?tribpub.com IWitter (d?borrelli",11/13/2014,"('also', 'the', 'potential')","('finedining', 'the', 'tweaks')",['” There’s also the potential gentrification of fine-dining (the tweaks made to conform to a better rating); the chefs who grow more businessoriented.'], Theres also the potential gentrification of finedining the tweaks made to conform to a better rating the chefs who grow more businessoriented

My pick for one of Europe’s Europe’s most impressive urban overhauls is London’s London’s Docklands.

Several decades later, investors realized the area was ripe for redevelopment, redevelopment, construction took off, and the neighborhood called Canary Wharf was bom.

While it’s difficult to determine determine the 606’s exact impact impact on that trend, Nolan said, “any kind of touted amenity” can drive up prices. And though rising property values can be good for those who own property, property, she said, only about 35 percent of units are owneroccupied owneroccupied in Logan Square and Humboldt Park. That means renters make up about 65 percent Nolan said, and they’re particularly particularly vulnerable to being priced out. Maldonado said he has been talking to residents about eventually introducing introducing a City Council ordinance ordinance to deal with the situation. Property tax relief provisions and a package to protect existing two-flats with affordable rent near the trail could be ways to keep the neighborhoods from getting overrun with luxury condos, he said. “The real estate people love (the 606) because they can build these multimillion-dollar multimillion-dollar developments nearby, but longtime residents residents have lots of fears that NANCY STONE/CHICAGO TRIBUNE PHOTOS A CTA Blue Line train nears the 606, in foreground, at Milwaukee Avenue.

Aid. Proco “Joe” Moreno, 1st, said he, too, is talking to Logan Square community groups about trying to find a way to provide property tax abatements for people who have owned property near the route of the 606 for many years. “We’re looking at it to see if there’s any precedent for that, and how it would work,” Moreno said. “You’re seeing home values going up, which, obviously, will be increased taxes. You’re seeing seeing people advertise their homes in real estate sections, sections, ‘Hey, close to the 606, close to the Bloomingdale Trail.’ It’s definitely an asset.” asset.” Greg Viti, a real estate agent at Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty, is thrilled for the 606 opening, for personal and professional professional reasons, and called the new park system “a very important thing for Chicago.” Chicago.” A Bucktown resident Viti Viti can see the trail from his house and looks forward to using it year-round. The project has definitely driven up prices within a few blocks of the trail, Viti said, and accelerated the gentrification gentrification occurring in Logan Square. But the community will also be safer and healthier as a result, he said. “If you live near the trail and don’t like it then ... sell, because you’re going to make a lot of money.

Like good schools and public transportation, parks generally increase the value of surrounding property, property, experts say. Emanuel’s endorsement of the rising property values as “not a bad thing” could leave him in an awkward place politically coming off a first term and re-election campaign in which opponents opponents tagged him with the nickname “Mayor 1 Percent” Percent” for what they said was his focus on programs and policies that benefit wealthy Chicagoans. The mayor has placed much emphasis on attracting attracting young, well-educated workers prized for hightech hightech jobs to live in hip Chicago neighborhoods like those near the 606, and the new urban playground is just the kind of postindustrial postindustrial repurposing that will lend the area even greater cachet with that set.

I drove to the Worcester Centrum (now the DCU Center) in Massachusetts with a friend to see Bruce Springsteen on opening night of his “Tunnel of Love” tour. This was a few years after the blockbuster “Bom in the U.S.A.” tour, so tickets were seemingly nonexistent. We didn’t have any ourselves ourselves but decided to try our luck, to wander the periphery of the arena and see what scalpers were asking. It’s what you did before Craigslist. We knew how useless our trip would probably be, and within minutes, our suspicions appeared to be correct: A scalper offered two tickets for $2,000 (that’s 1988 dollars); another more saintly scalper wanted $750 for one. Just as we decided to call it a night, a man casually asked: “How many?” Two, I said guardedly, guardedly, expecting to hear a Pentagon-like price. He handed me two tickets tickets and. though it was February, February, said, “Merry Christmas” Christmas” and walked off. We didn’t ask questions. We got in line, halfexpecting halfexpecting to be arrested for passing what were probably probably fraudulent tickets. Instead, we sailed through the gate and found our seats (lower arena, near the back) and noticed that others around us were holding similarly confused smiles and kibitzing, assembling assembling how they had gotten so lucky. Turns out that man, a representative from Springsteen’s management, management, gave away rows of seats. And he did it at every Springsteen concert, to undermine the insanely inflated prices of predatory scalpers, as a show of decency. decency. He was the miracle man.

Not in the religious sense (though it did instill some faith in mankind), if that world existed. And yet, a lot of Deadheads Deadheads will be praying for a miracle this week, when the Grateful Dead perform three sold-out shows at Soldier Field, billed as the final concerts in the band’s 50-year run. Indeed. Deadheads Deadheads pioneered the concept concept of the concert miracle, the unlikely free ticket, gifted by a friend or a stranger, a left-field act of kindness to remind you that experiencing a live performance shouldn’t just be about having enough cash. It can be about community, community, and generosity. And though I have never been much of a fan of the Grateful Dead. I have always always been a fan of Deadheads, Deadheads, and in particular of this anachronistically earnest earnest code, which states that a concert ticket should not be just another opportunity to fleece your fellow man. As Linda Engels, of Edgebrook, Edgebrook, a veteran of some 100 Dead and Jerry Garcia shows, put it: “Basically, you do your best to get your friends into shows. Someone Someone has kind eyes? You try to help them, too. And unless they are going through a personal crisis, the true Deadhead would never ask you more than face value for their ticket. “That would be. you know, immoral.” But it’s a free market, I said. “And I get that,” she said. “But it’s not just a concert you’re messing with. It’s a culture.” That is a brave argument MICHAEL TERCHA/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Deadheads pioneered the concept of the concert miracle, the unlikely free ticket, gifted by a friend or a stranger, a left-field act of kindness to remind you that experiencing a live performance shouldn’t just be about having enough cash. It can be about community, and generosity. for 2015. One that cuts philosophically philosophically deeper than the Dead and its erstwhile community. community. To paraphrase Engels: When selling a concert ticket, it is not morally OK to ask more than what you paid for that ticket. And it’s not OK because, as the argument goes, art is for everyone, and if you believe that everyone deserves the same opportunity to enjoy the music that you enjoy, then you have a responsibility responsibility to promote community. community. Is this a hippy-dippy argument? Yes. Is it realistic? realistic? No, and you will not get far with this line of reasoning — why, after all. CENTURY STRATFORD SQUARE F Army Trail ?

When I called Max Waisvisz, Waisvisz, founder of Gold Coast Tickets, Chicago?s largest local ticket broker, and wondered if it was morally or ethically wrong to charge more than face value for tickets, it took all of his strength not to laugh: “Look, this is a pure form of capitalism and everything now is a commodity.” Emma Leggat, the head of U.S. communications for leading ticket resale site StubHub, said that the company offers no moral judgments or guidelines for the prices that the ticket sellers on its website set. She said that possibly because because ticket resale “was handled in the past in an unsavory way.” people tended to draw distinctions between the legitimacy of reselling concert tickets and the reselling of, say, a house or car. “But millennials millennials rarely make that same distinction between secondary secondary and primary markets. markets. And with a show like the Dead, they are just thrilled to have access at all.? In other words, the Deadhead argument for selling tickets at face value is now quaint, improbable nonsense. David Browne, a longtime contributor to Rolling Stone and author of the new Dead history “So Many Roads,? said there’s a point to be made that the Deadhead ?code of civility?? itself has been eroding since the band’s late ’80s popularity attracted a broad audience: ?Then Jerry died in 1995 and having a community was hard.” But maybe this is also an argument worth having, the kind that questions conventional conventional wisdom. You might even say it’s the best thing to come out of the Dead ticket fiasco this winter, that awkward mash of old school (mail order) and conventional (Ticketmaster) ticketing that resulted in a land rush for 150,000 seats — and a lot of bad vibes. Engels told me she and many of her fellow Chicago Deadheads went the mailorder mailorder route assuming they would get tickets; they always had that way before. Plane tickets were bought and vacation days planned, then no one landed a single ticket. They turned online briefly, but prices were “nuts.” so they fell back on fellow Deadheads. Old bonds were cemented again and everyone found tickets. At face value. To hear her tell this is to hear an idealistic community community grappling with a 21stcentury 21stcentury gentrification of concertgoing. When they started attending concerts, selling tickets was called “scalping” and now it’s called “resale.?

Wiseman’s 40th film, it continues his obsession with the institutions, the juices and the peculiarities peculiarities of American life and the democratic democratic process. It’s a very good thing to experience around the Thanksgiving holidays; some of us give thanks to Wiseman Wiseman with each new project the 85-yearold 85-yearold master brings to fruition. Jackson Heights sits not far yet a world away from Manhattan. Formerly known as Trains Meadow, the neighborhood neighborhood is a multiethnic mosaic of a Queens, N.Y., landmark where, as one resident says, 167 languages fill the air. True to Wiseman’s form, “In Jackson Heights” contains no on-screen identification identification of camera subjects, no voice-over narration and little in the way of overt polemics. By the end, you arrive at the essential paradox found in every Wiseman Wiseman portrait: a clear sense of just how cloudy our world and our environments have become.

Packaged to recall 1970s sci-fi classics (like “Phase IV” and the ’78 “Invasion of the Body Snatchers”), goodhumored goodhumored but not campy in its regard of some genuinely fascinating research, and full of trippy visuals, this science-fair bonanza would have been a midnight staple in the era of “The Hellstrom Chronicle.” Today, Tim Grabham and Jasper Sharp’s feature will have to build its cult following primarily via download sales, though it certainly rewards bigscreen bigscreen exposure. Thriving mostly out of sight under rotting logs and other places where moisture and bacteria are plentiful, slime molds were long classified as fungi, and briefly as an animal form — because unlike most plant life, they not only grow but can move. (In laboratory settings they can “run? a petri-dish maze to get to a food source.) In fact, they are neither, but rather a weird and wonderful if littlestudied littlestudied part of Mother Nature.

In 1950s Enniscorthy, Ireland, young Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) strives for more than what her small town can offer. Without job or marriage prospects prospects at home, she takes the leap across the Atlantic to seek her fortune in New York City. Eilis is desperately homesick until she starts taking accounting classes and meets a charming Italian guy. All too soon, a family death calls her back to the motherland, and Eilis finds that what she left behind wasn’t so bad after all. “Brooklyn” “Brooklyn” is an evergreen, universal story. It captures the struggles and heartache of any immigrant living in and learning a new country, and it also rings entirely, almost painfully true for any young person who’s left behind a small-town life for the siren call of the big city. — Katie Walsh “Room” ★ ★ ★ R, 1:58, drama The premise of director director Lenny Abrahamson?s splendidly acted, if everso-slightly everso-slightly dodgy, film version of the 2010 Emma Donoghue novel, is simple and brutally confining.

Yet theirs are being lived inside a 10-by-10-foot garden shed. For a time, we watch in a state of dread and wonder. The parent/child relationship at the movie’s core is endlessly fascinating And in a key scene, when the shock gives way to old recriminations, the movie reminds us that stories such as these can never end in the middle. — ALP. “Spectra” -kirk PG-13,2:30, action “Spectre” cost nearly $300 million to make, and I suppose it was worth it It’s a good Bond movie, which will be good enough for many millions of fans.

Wojcik brings honesty to the guv?s earnestness, and I like that we don?t know precisely? what is drayving him to the shop. But the tonal sensibility of the character is off Architects operate on their oyvn level of style and cool, and while it might be a more high-end presentation than that of the bike-shop hipsters, it feels like a miscalculation to style this character (in look and outlook) as a middle middle manager type in a cheap suit. Annie Prichard, who play’s his sister, isn?t given much to do beyond her role as a shrill and villainous counterpoint to the more authentic shop workers, which feels like a cheat. The deck shouldn?t be so entirely stacked, not ifyou want an audience to stay with you.

But we only get glimpses of him, and this points to another missing piece — a sense of a whole gang of regulars hanging out at this bike shop, just shooting the breeze and (this is key for an audience) showing us why they might be such appealing company - rather than smug cliches. That said, the casting of Elmourabit as well as Alex Dauphin (as a enigmatic if clenched shop employee) reveals how vital it is to populate a show yvith nonwhite nonwhite actors, thereby creating creating a yvorld that actually resembles the city we lire in.

Jesse Jackson, famous for rhymes like “Down with dope, up with hope,” might label it “Take from the greedy, give to the needy.” I refer to a promising but halfcooked halfcooked proposal floated by Mayor Rahm Emanuel that calls for charging developers more for the right to pack extra square footage into downtown buildings and using that money for projects in economically depressed neighborhoods. neighborhoods. As if to make up for the higher costs, the plan would expand the downtown area, opening new territory where developers could build megaskyscrapers. megaskyscrapers. In concept, the proposal represents represents a smart way to close the “tale of two cities” gap between Chicago’s booming, ever-moreglamorous ever-moreglamorous downtown and its desolate, violence-plagued neighborhoods. neighborhoods. But there are lots of potential pitfalls. An invasion of towers would destroy the cohesive cohesive character of close-to-downtown close-to-downtown neighborhoods like Chinatown. Chinatown. It also could push parts of the city’s already strained transit infrastructure to the breaking point. As always, God (or the devil) will be in the details. For decades, Chicago and other cities have offered developers an economic incentive, or bonus, to provide amenities like outdoor plazas that aimed to enliven the streetscape and benefit the public. public. In exchange, the developers were permitted to add profitable square footage to their nigh-rises, in some cases transforming them into the peaks of Chicago’s manmade manmade mountain range. But the bonuses reflected the priorities of an era when ragged downtowns were sprucing themselves themselves up after the flight of businesses businesses and residents to the suburbs. suburbs. Today, the Loop is a buffed global hub where tech workers live in luxury high-rises and exercise exercise their Chihuahuas along the riverwalk. New circumstances demand new approaches. So credit David Reifman, the city’s recently installed planning commissioner, commissioner, for rethinking the hodgepodge of bonuses that have piled up over the years.

JASON WAMBSGANS/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Under a new proposal, buildings in some areas near downtown could be built even taller than the Kenect Chicago tower on Milwaukee Avenue. the right balance between a desire desire to reform the bonus system and blow it to smithereens. While he wants to eliminate outdated bonuses for winter gardens that provide little public benefit, he still envisions “local impact bonuses” bonuses” that encourage upgrades to CTA stations or plazas near new towers. Yet the new emphasis emphasis is clearly on using downtown as an engine to drive growth to poor neighborhoods. They need necessities more than the downtown downtown needs amenities. Building on the precedent of a bonus that lures developers to pony up for the city’s affordable hoiLsing fund, the proposed neighborhood opportunity bonus would help underwrite grocery stores in food deserts or pharmacy/convenience pharmacy/convenience stores along barren commercial strips. Developers Developers would pay an amount that is still to be determined in exchange exchange for the right to make their towers taller, bigger or both. Such details will emerge when Reifman Reifman presents the complete plan, probably next month. I asked Reifman how the plan would avoid problems associated with tax increment financing districts, which critics say provide pots of money that city officials spend arbitrarily. worry about shelter. “They want to push us out to the suburbs. I don’t want to go to the suburbs. I want to live in the city I grew up in.” About 50 people joined the demonstration, and many carried palm branches in commemoration commemoration of Palm Sunday. “As Christians, we believe housing housing is a human right,” said the Rev.

He cited an under-construction shopping center at 63rd and Halsted streets that will include a Whole Foods supermarket, saying that the city supported the project because of its location near an “L” station and Kennedy-King College. When finished, he said, the center will have a “catalytic impact.” Trouble is, such impacts may be limited. When Emanuel unveiled the plan last month, he estimated it would generate about $40 million to $50 million in the next three of four years. At best, that works out to $16.7 million annually, a minuscule minuscule amount compared with the $372 million the city collected last year from tax increment finance districts. The “spread the wealth” optics of the neighborhood bonus, which seemed designed to bolster Emanuel’s standing after the Laquan McDonald crisis, may be better than its outcomes. Other optics could be downright downright ugly.

Moreno, whose 1st Ward includes lathrop, has rejected the suggestion that he did not ensure CHA would commit to replacing the lost public housing units. stretch of Milwaukee Avenue, the Near West Side and Chinatown. In theory?, developers in those zones could ask to more than double or triple the amount of square footage they’re currently allowed to build on a given site. Imagine sticking the next Willis Tower amid the pagoda-style roofs in the heart of Chinatown, and you have some idea of the urban design chaos the plan could bring. Reifman and Aid. Danny Solis, 25th, chair of the City Council’s zoning committee, insist such outcomes won’t happen because of the city?s extensive review process for large-scale projects. But why open the door to such a possibility? It would be better to treat the expanded downtown districts as transition zones between between the peaks of downtown and the plains of the neighborhoods. neighborhoods. In other words, it’s fine to build a 10- or 15-storv apartment highrise, highrise, particularly if it?s near a transit stop, but not the next Trump Tower. Another threat is overburdened overburdened infrastructure, according to Roosevelt University real estate expert Jon B. DeVries, co-author of the book ?Planning Chicago.” I le cites the city’s Central Area Moreno pointed to a letter from Eugene Jones, CEO of the housing authority, written shortly before the proposal was presented to the Plan Commission. ?CHA is c ommitted to produc - ing 525 new housing opportunities, opportunities, in general and opportunity areas in the North Side of the city, understanding that the timing will be based on the availability and price of properties, which must be in accordance with existing law,” Jones wrote Feb. 17. That isn’t enough for the community community members, who said CHA has yet to detail when and where those units would be constructed. Opponents of the redevelopment redevelopment long have criticized the CHA for failing to rehabilitate or rent hundreds of units vacated by former residents who used private vouchers to move to private housing. housing. They say the units could be used to house people in need but instead much of the complex is boarded up. ?It’s a shame and a disgrace that the city with all of these empty units and such a long waiting list of families that need housing they do so little about it,” said Miguel Suarez, 65, who has lived at Lathrop Homes for nearly three decades. “With all of the marketrate marketrate housing surrounding us, there’s really no need for mixedincome mixedincome housing.” Said Rindfleisch: “Whether it’s here, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park or I lumboldt Park, (developers) just further displace low-income and vulnerable residents.” cdrhodes?tribpub.com Twitter {drhodes-dawn Action Plan of2009, which urged that billions of dollars be spent on new subways and other transit projects to handle the crowds that are an inevitable byproduct of new high-rises. But few of those improvements have been made, and jam-packed “L” trains show what happens when density expands and transit capacity doesn?t. “If you’re not continuing to increase transit capacitywhile you’re increasing land-use density, density, you risk shutting the whole merry-go-round down,” DeVries said “You kill the goose that’s laying the egg.” And so the debate goes. They who draw the zoning map shape the city. But zoning ideally is a tool to achieve the aims of careful urban planning. At this stage in its development, the neighborhood bonus reflects a laudable desire to make the marketplace work for both the haves and the have-nots. Yet refinement and redrawing of the zoning map are needed before this plan achieves the related goals of good design and social equity.

104,1945260713,"TURN IT UP By Gkkc; Kot CHICAGO TRIBUNE Moby, shown at the North Coast Music Festival in Chicago in 2010. has written a memoir. “Porcelain.? about his days as a struggling musician in New York in the 1990s. Moby’s New York state of mind Rock memoirs rarely live up to expectations, hut Moby’s forthcoming forthcoming “Porcelain” (Penguin Ifress) is an exception. It ranks with Kim Gordon?s “Girl in a Band” and a handful of others in recent years as a particularly incisive look at not just a life in music, but at the cultural and social circumstances that helped shape it. It is by turns self-deprecating, hilarious and moving, particularly? when Moby describes the ecstatic sense of community he would find at an underground rave or how the tears came when he finished a track such as “God Moving Over the Face of the Waters.” “Porcelain” focuses on the ’90s, a decade when Moby graduated from his punk-rock days in Connecticut Connecticut to become an electronicmusician electronicmusician living barely above the poverty line in lower Manhattan in New York City. He scored a major club hit in 1991 with “Go,” which brought Madonna and even a pre-fall-from-grace O.J. Simpson to his performances, and then fell from favor as the club scene shifted from joyous rave music to something darker. Moby recovered in 1995 with his breakthrough album, “Everything “Everything is Wrong,” which blended ambient music, techno and punk into an alluring overview of his wide-ranging tastes. I Ie nearly scuttled his career again in 1996 with the abrasive “Animal Rights,” a punishing rock album released just as electronic music* LOCAL SOUNDS Maren Celest is bringing joy By Britt Juijous Chicago Tribune Unlike the saying, Maren Celest Celest is more than just a jack of all trades. Rather than dabble in different pursuits, she has excelled excelled in a variety of mediums. She primarily considers herself a visual artist and has built a strong local following as a photographer of other musicians. ?I really love portray-ing people in an unexpected way,” Celest said about her practice. But she does not limit herself, and so although she has built a robust c areer as a photographer, she also continues to explore and intertwine intertwine other artistic mediums to connect to her laiger narrative of bringing joy to followers. I Ier professional music career, whic-h began with the now-de funct band Photographers, was also an immersive experience that taught her how to be a musician. musician. She learned while on stage, and her time in that group gave her the inspiration to pursue music on her own. “It made me really fearless so I can see how bad things can go and how gocxl things can go,? Celest said. Now, as a solo artist, her music* is a testament to confronting and exposing personal vulnerabilities. ?Writing is so vulnerable because because you?re basic ally trying to describe what’s in your mind,” she said. “That vulnerability is not was booming again with the Prodigy, Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. The memoir takes the reader to the doorstep of the musician’s biggest-selling album, “Play,” which he wrote and recorded recorded while thinking his career was essentially over. In an interview interview (excerpted below), Moby looks back on his New York years: Q: Why focus on these 10 years? A: I was at a party? five years ago in Bushwiek (Brooklyn), sharing my old-guy New York stories when rents were cheap and crack was everywhere, and I felt a little like Grandpa Simpson, telling these young people these ancient stories. Someone said that I should write them down, and I started writing down New York memories.... I wanted each chapter chapter to hold up as a bar-room story-, so that even if someone didn’t like me or know who I was, they could still find something entertaining. entertaining. ... There’s also something about New York during that time. I went to a screening of a documentary- documentary- a few years ago about the Ix)wer East Side in the late ’80s, early ’90s, and everyone who went to the screening was lamenting lamenting the gentrification of New York and waxing rhapsodic* about that time. What we re really saying saying is that we’re sad that we’re old.... There’s a romanticism attac hed to living in squalor in a dangerous c*rack neighborhood but somehow emeiging unscathed. unscathed. It was the first time we’d When: 8:30 p.m. Wednesday Where: Constellation. 3111 N. Western Ave. Tickets: $10.18+: www.constell ation-chicago.com just being emotional and really raw. It’s my writing, it’s my words, it?s my- voicx’.? Whether through her lyrics, her storytelling, her voicx* or even her visage, music* has become an outlet for addressing addressing those parts of herself, she said. Celest said that she’s most fearful on stage and is working toward eradicating that fear, while still connecting to her various various interests. “It’s like a really bitter medicine,” Celest said. ?It’s like really hard when you’re doing it, and it sucks afterward. But later on, it helps to be that vulnerable, vulnerable, as I think that’s an im portant part of art and expression. It helps your art relate to other people.? As an artist, she aims to make her music* and her performances less about the herself and more about the audiencx, she said. In her latest efforts, she plans to incorporate different perform ancx* art elements and make the experience more interactive, effectively breaking the onstage singer songwriter narrative. ?I’m trying to bridge* the gap between performance art and singer-songwriter stuff, and I When: 7:30 p.m. May 24 Where: City Winery. 1200 W. Randolph St. Tickets: $12; www.citywinery .com ever left college and had our own spaces and c ould congratulate ourselves on being able to get by on $4,000 a year. Q: It’s your first tmyor writing writing project. Did you know what you were up against? A: I’d read a lot of other memoirs, memoirs, and I found them either anodyne or not very generous. You read a classic-rock memoir, and the guy spends 20 pages on minutiae that no one cares about. They obviously didn’t have an editor because someone should have said, ‘No one cares what strings you used on your guitar.’ Maybe 10 people do. You want emotional resonance. Q: Why end the hook on the* cusp of your biggest success? A: That’s suc h a valid question. I would love to have a second book, and I’ve written 150 pages, but the people I showed it to found it to be salacious. It’s all about fame gone wrong the drugs, the sex, the debauchery-. It’s a much more conventional story: The musician becomes famous, is unprepared for it and then is destroyed by it. Q: There arc a couple of think I’ll fex’l really satisfied once I do that,? she said. “I think I’m trying to break down the barriers and actually surprise people.” That bridge will also help her overcome her fears as a performer, performer, creating a style that is not just her on the stage. She pushed through performance anxiety in her first years and now credits that push outside of her comfort zone as the reason why she has grown as an artist. “Crown maker,” a new single from her latest release, “No Need,? is a quiet, eerie wonder. The track is largely- instrumental, featuring familiar plucked strings that build in urgency. Much of her music is like this. Celest invokes a certain level of minimalism in her work (most evident in the live setting, whic’h often features only Celest?s voice and a ukulele). But a second listen peels bac k layers of precision. Instruments are c-oupled and overlapping into a harmonious end prcxluct that sounds equal parts weird and lovely. It is compelling music* that sounds unlike almost anything else out there. She is at work on her next album, slated for release this fall. But first she has plans to release a new single and accompanying video, the latest cross-medium experiment for her. After attending attending a women’s filmmaking night, Celest left with a new desire to explore video art. The experiencx* points in the book where you describe how you thought your career was over in a very fickle industry. What kept you going? A: A deep love for making music*. When I was growing up in the 70s and ’80s, the musicians I loved all seemed broke. I’d go see Mission of Burma, and they- were not glamorous rock stars. They were sitting on the front of the stage drinking beer before their show. When “Animal Rights” failed, I was still milking a living playing music, so I couldn’t be that much of a failure. Plus, I never had a fallback plan I couldn’t do anything else. Q: So why did you make a punk-metal album just as the dance music you were known for was on the rise commercially? commercially? A: As the mid-’90s happened, I got a little bored with how sophist sophist icated dance music* was becoming. Danc*c music* had become almost like gentleman?s music, more academic. The libidinous libidinous chaos of it, the female celebration celebration in a lot of early dance music*, that was going away. That made me sad. At the same time, I rediscovered a lot of guitar music*. I largely blame Sepultura and Pantera. They were both making amazing records, and I wanted to go in the musical direction that spoke to me more, that I had an emotional connection with.... In hindsight, I should have said to my- managers, ‘I’ll make a punk record under a pseudonym and MAREN CELEST PHOTO Maren Celest is a photographer and musician. “I’m trying to bridge the gap between performance art and singer songwriter stuff,? she said. left her with the knowledge that she iscapabk* of actually explor ingthe medium, that she can create a complete product and that video is, if not inherent to how she thinks as a c*reator, at make a danc*c record under my own mime.’ That’s what a smart person would’ve done. But I?m stubbornly proud of that album. Q: “Play” sold millions of albums, but you didn’t see it coming. You made this beautiful beautiful music while thinking no one would ever hear it, right? A: After the failure of “Animal Rights,” I wanted to make an even darker metal record. But one of my managers said this simple sentence: ?People really like your electronic* music.” There was an emotional aspect to what he said that just struck me. It?s not that people would buy it, they just like it. And I thought if I have the abilitv to make music* that reaches people and touches them emotionally, emotionally, I should probably- focus on that. That turned me off the path of making a super-dark metal album, and making this wistful, winsome electronic record (instead). But, yes, I felt like a bottomed-out has-been. My managers were trying to have meetings with labels, and at least half wouldn’t even return our calls, and the rest were dismissive. When “Play” came out, it was supposed to be a failure, a weird low-fi record that was going to disappear and fade away. Greg Kot co-hasts ?Sound Opinions” Opinions” at 8 pm.

430,1945399907,"The clown’s pratfall from Grace Clowns, from Page 1 came on a Tuesday. There were three. It was early October. According to the eight children at Greenwood Greenwood Elementary School who said they saw them, the clowns stood on the north side of their red bric k school building, just beyond the chain-link fence along Parmalee Parmalee Place, a residential stretch were the homes have vinyl siding and cornstalks decorate front doors and a neighborhcx?dwatch neighborhcx?dwatch sign stands sentinel. The kids came back from afternoon recess and reported to their teachers that one clown held a knife and one fingered his pocket as if carrying a gun and one carried a briefcase. They said the clowns warned them that they would return in a few days and kill them. And then, as clowns do, they sped away in a black SIJV. Nicholas Alajakis, chief of staff of Waukegan Waukegan Public Schools, heard about the clowns soon after. Greenwood was put on lockdown. Parents flooded schools with panicked calls. Rumors spread across Facebook. But Alajakis was skeptical, and perversely, a little nostalgic. I Ie was reminded reminded of when he was a grade-school student himself in Waukegan. In 1991, a rumor had spread across Chicago and into the suburbs: A clown was said to be luring kids into a van That week young Alajakis peddled home from school as fast as he could Three decades later, in his office, he remembered “I was seriously unnerved by that whole thing. And so I get why kids would be freaked by this today. But also, I don’t remember there being nearly as many evil clowns around when I was a ldd It makes me wonder do we even get happy clowns anymore?” How did clowns fall so far? I low did clowns go from red in their hair to blood on their hands? From a friendly smile to fangs? From clumsy to calculated? There are those who saw it coming: In 2008, a survey of250 British children found the majority did not like downs. This past spring at Knox College in downstate Galesburg, Frank McAndrew, McAndrew, a professor of psychology, conducted conducted a study on the nature of creepiness, later published in New Ideas in Psychology: Psychology: He found that, of 1,341 respondents asked to rank the creepiness of 21 professions, professions, including funeral director and taxidermist, taxidermist, clown was No. 1. ?People tended to define ‘creepiness’ as unpredictable behavior, and clowns have this quality in spades,” he said. The Great Clown Scare of 2016 only seemed random. The first reports came from South Carolina: Carolina: Children were claiming clowns were trying to lead them into the woods. A middle-aged woman in a laundromat said a clown was staring ominously at her. From there, reports of threatening clowns spread as fast as local police could debunk them: Clowns were scaring fast-food workers in Detroit; waving machetes in North Carolina; wielding swords in New York. By late September, at least 33 states had bad-clown sightings. Eureka College near Peoria canceled an evening of classes because of threats from supposed clowns on social media. On the South Side of Chicago, parents reported being chased by clowns. Roving clown gangs were rumored rumored in Chicago I Ieights.

Several psychologists, quoted by a winking media, diagnosed a mass, country-wide hysteria. And yet, Bingo, Chuckles, lickles, Squeaky sorry, this was inevitable. Probable even, the trashing of an archetype archetype rarely benign to begin with, ?the modem down having become a perverted rotting husk who once had cultural capital” capital” said Andrew Stott, a professor of English at the University of Buffalo who specializes in comedy history. Even worse: The cultural fault lines at the oversized feet of the down run straight through Chicago. Via ancient Greece. The fool, and later the jester, prototypes of the contemporary clown, were familiar figures in early cultures, a tolerated member member of many a leader’s entourage: The I^akota tribe of the Great Plains have the heyoka, a contrarian, ironic figure allowed to comically intrude cm solemn rituals. Early Chinese and Egyptian courts employed employed their own roguish outsiders who spoke grim truths to power with a smile. In Medieval England, jesters were occasionally occasionally mutilated, their face muscles cut to force permanent grins. Think of Batman’s Batman’s Joker, or any villain delivering bad news with a grin. In the 16th century?, the jester was joined by the harlequin, who in early incarnations was a folk demon known for his jaunts through hell. On stage, in Italy, where the character was popularized, he was not to be trusted, dressed in patched clothes, physically daring, elegant. “The harlequin and jester were inscrutable, sophisticated, razorsharp razorsharp verbal wits,” said Stott. “But the clown, who didn’t yet look the way we think of him, was more of a rustic buffoon, a low character.” In the 18th century?, Regency London, having imported the masked, Italian tradition tradition of commedia dell’arte, found a superstar superstar in Joseph Grimaldi. Before the English English actor began clcjwning, the stage clown wore rouge on his cheeks and a sack. Grimaldi Grimaldi who created the clown we know today, added white foundation to his face, high eyebrows, brightly colored hair and clothes. Also, he was known for his total absorption in the role, said Stott, who wrote a 2009 biography of the entertainer. Emmett Kelly?s sad character was the most popular clown In the 20th century. MCDONALD?S Ronald McDonald (shown with sidekick Grimace) frequently visited children’s hospitals.

But at the same time, the more popular the circus grew, the larger the venues. “Clowns got broader and less nuanced,” said Scott O’Donnell, executive director of the Circus World museum in Baraboo, Wis., and a former Ringling clown. ?You had to play to a whole arena now.

The next morning, kids were bringing clown masks to sc hool. Alajakis Alajakis heard of oleier students three clowns, each a Chicago invention. There’s Bozo, whose WGN-TV show debuted in 1960. He became so beloved that the character, originally played by actor Bob Bell, became an arehety?pe arehety?pe himself: Red nose, red fright wig, ruffled harlequin jumpsuit. Bozo was franchised across the country; In Chicago, the taping of “The Bozo Show” had a 10-year wait for tickets. Bozo was also kind of a jerk, a wise guy. Joey D’Auria, who played Bozo from 1984 to 2001, remembers: remembers: “I didn?t juggle or do balloon animals. Ringling clowns would come to the show and ask me how I got the job. So I would tell them: Because I’m an actor.’ ” letter, Dan Castellaneta, an Oak Park native whose voice for Krusty the Clown on ?The Simpsons” cemented the image of the ethic-ally hollow, bitter children?s entertainer, entertainer, would c laim Bozo, and Bell, as the primary influence.

Ronald not long after Ringling pioneered the practice of using its clowns as a kind of therapy was also a regular visitor to children?s hospitals. hospitals. John Wayne Gacy took advantage of that trust. He wasn’t Chicago?s first killer clown: Charles Conway, a circus performer with a wooden leg, murdered an heiress in 1912 with his clown handkerchief; the story’ became national news. Gacy, however, was prolific: As Pogo the Clown, the Norwcxxl Park resident despite being arrested in 1968 for sexually molesting a teenager worked children?s hospitals and birthday parties around Chicago. He killed at least 33 boys and men, sometimes while dressed as a down, later burying their bodies beneath his home. After he was arrested in 1978, Mary’ I Iickey Panayotou, who had started Chicago Costume a few years earlier, said: “I couldn’t sell clown costumes, not for a long while.” At the end of the 1970s, earnestness lay in tatters. The clown crying in yard-sale paintings, used as a prescription for the blues in the kitsch ballad “Send in the Clowns,” leading children into Nazi gas chambers in Jerry’ lewis’ infamous, unreleased movie “The Day the Clown Cried” now represented schmaltz. They’ seemed like a cynical reminder that nothing was innocent now. They became, as Freud termed “the uncanny,” familiar yet odd in 1970, Japanese Japanese robotics professor Masahiro Mori, describing the feeling that something with human qualities is not quite human, c alled it “the uncanny’ valley.” Today, in describing describing what makes a clown well-suited to horror, psychologists mention this ambiguity: ambiguity: Clowns ?aren’t gocxl at revealing intentions” (Rami Nader, Vancouver anxiety anxiety specialist); they point to our hardwired hardwired understanding that ?the cost of ignoring even vague dinger signals is greater than responding” (Richard Zinbarg, Zinbarg, founder of the anxiety and panic treatment program at Northwestern University’s University’s Family Institute). But Steve Schlozman, a psychiatrist at I larvard l Iniversity’ who teaches the psychology’ of horror, put it best: “Our brain Is good at knowing what something looks like, and horror is all about context. A clown in a circus Is benign. But a clown waving in your backyard is out of context.” The first evil-clown sightings, which c ame just after Gacy went to jail, were around New England in 1981; then Rennsylvania, Rennsylvania, then Missouri. The creepy c lown in Stephen King?s novel “It” (1986) and in the movie ?Poltergeist” (1982) became became a meme. King’s Pennywise may plague Maine every’ 27 years, but in the real world, evil clowns were more prolific, reaching Chic ago in 1991, Texas in 1992. Still, 2016 is different. Kids have been arrested for bringing knives to school to protect themselves from downs. Mobs of college students go “down hunting.” Shriner downs have canceled parade appearances. Wrinkles, a Florida c lown, became a (true) legend among parents for acc epting money to sc are unruly children. King himself in early October, tweeted ?Hey, guys, time to c ool the down hysteria.” ?What’s different,” said Randv Christensen, Christensen, president of the Michigan-based World Clown Association, “is the proliferation proliferation of this idea. A member told me she pulled up in front of first grader’s house to play a birthdiv party and four policemen surrounded the oar.” Steven Finnegan, the Chicago down Shenanigans, has been performing a ?Don’t Be Afraid of Clowns” show for kids for 30 years: ?Walk in as a down, some kids freak, lilt on your makeup makeup in front of t hem” which he does “there?s zero chance of an issue.” And yet, even Shenanigans Is struggling against the sexial media rumor mill, our ingrained celebrity-culture understanding that all performers lead dual lives, evil-clown videos on Facebook that serve as a reminder reminder how fake surveillance-camera and cell-phone footage is a cheap, potent contemporary contemporary horror trope. ?I hate to put it this way,” Stott said “but the happy clown may not recover. I le is an idea in dec line. There?s no going back.” Within 24 hours of the Waukegan clown sighting, police determined it was a hoax. The kids admitted they made up the story’, polict? said Lockdown was lifted. Around the country’, as in Waukegan, a pattern formed c hildren admitted they lied teenagers teenagers were caught in bad make-up.

It placed its bets on fearless young artists overcoming overcoming adversity and never knowing when to stop. It declared itself to be the city where you came to do the thing you love, where the game can still be fun. where hard work pays off better than connections, where you can have the best time of your life doing what you feel like you were born to do. And that there is no point in waiting until next year. The extraordinary autumnal trajectory trajectory of the world champion Chicago Cubs has fit this model precisely. Joe Maddon is a formidable artistic director, a conductor of the Cubs symphony symphony to rival Riccardo Mud, a “yes. and? creative leader who understands that you can?t just tell people what to do and expect them to do it. They have to want to perform their best because they genuinely believe in you and your artistic vision. The players have the skills of the improviser. They have learned how to pass focus to each other. No wonder so many Chicago artists thrill to the Cubs, despite their misgivings misgivings on where so much of their money might actually be going. They?ve also been forgiving about the transformation and gentrification of the area of the city Wrigleyville that the Cubs call home. But at this moment of change, as dive bars give way to the Hotel Zachary and whitetablecloth whitetablecloth dining takes over from Italian Italian beef, it needs asserting that Wrigleyville Wrigleyville has an important artistic history. history. And the clout-heavy Cubs are its keepers. The team has to make sure that the arts keep their long-established long-established place around its storied ballpark. And now?s the time to get this on the Rickettses? agenda. For there is history here. Take, for example, the pivotal role of Wrigleyville in the development of the Chicago music scene.

Presentation Joe Knowles, Sports Mary Ellen Podmolik, Business EDITORIALS Crime’s toll on a neighborhood Violence that crushes lives also crushes parts of Chicago Witnessing the decline of South Shore is sad and frustrating. This attractive neighborhood neighborhood on the lakefront, within easy commuting distance of the Loop, should never have lost its place as a bastion of Chicago’s African-American middle class. “In my mind’s eye, the South Shore of my youth was pristine,” Tribune reporter William Lee wrote last year. ‘With its big old homes and apartments, four grocery stores and doctors’ offices... a black child in the ’80s could feel insulated from the trappings of urban life.” Then the violence intruded. On Tuesday, a Tribune story chronicled the emotional and economic stress on South Shore, where a high crime rate is crushing hopes for what was one of the city’s bedrock black neighborhoods. The report, written by Kathy Bergen, Angela Caputo and Lee, explores an important secondary cost of crime on Chicago’s streets. Beyond the pain and fear that violence violence inflicts on victims and their families, crime sucks vitality out of neighborhoods. Ripple effects leave the city weaker. And South Shore is not alone. City leaders leaders have not acknowledged the particular peril of black flight — middle-class black families moving out of stable city neighborhoods neighborhoods because of rising crime. Joining South Shore on the precipice: Chatham, Washington Park, Woodlawn and to some degree Hyde Park. Farther south, Pullman and Morgan Park. Families are moving to the suburbs, to Southern states, to Indiana. Stability in a community requires investment investment of dollars, time and faith in tomorrow tomorrow That only happens where people with good, steady jobs want to live. The gentrification of Logan Square speaks to that, as does the rising livability of neighborhoods neighborhoods ranging from Bridgeport and Bronzeville to the South Loop and Lakeview. Lakeview. That South Shore is heading in the opposite direction is tragic for Chicago because the neighborhood has the housing stock, location and tradition that families should find desirable. Attacking animal cruelty If this 120-member protection caucus can move Congress Americans are politically divided and riven by cultural conflicts that are enough to make them forget they’re all part of one people. But when it comes to nonhuman creatures, the divisions melt away. In red states and blue states alike, attitudes at the dog park, the pet supply shop or the aquarium aquarium tend to be unified — and passionate. Pretty much everyone loves animals and wants to keep them from being abused. The most disliked player in the NFL, according according to a 2013 Forbes poll? Michael Vick, and not because of anything he did on the gridiron. Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have taken this phenomenon to heart. A raft of proposed legislation aimed at improving the welfare of animals has drawn support on both sides of the aisle. In fact, more than 120 members have joined a group that once would have WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING It’s possible, of course, that the shape of Trump’s emergent emergent presidency will change. His family’s grift and his own callous incompetence could easily be eclipsed by crisis, including events that benefit him politically. But given his obvious unfitness for high office, Trump will most likely continue to be a messy failure, come what may. These are complex and uncertain times. Democrats lack the answers to many difficult questions. They haven’t identified new leaders who can articulate new policies to address new (along with stubborn old) challenges. For now, however, Democrats don’t need the answer to every question. They need only convince voters, by November November 2018, that they have the answer to one question: Who can replace these flailing, Trump-soiled Republicans? Republicans? Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg View For the world’s most dangerously ambitious and threatening threatening tyrannies — from Russia to China, from North Korea to Iran — President Obama’s neutering of American power over the past eight years created a host of opportunities that they eagerly seized. The sorry truth, given the character character of these regimes, is that they would have been fools not to.... All this is part of the Obama legacy: the rising global agglomerate of emboldened tyrannies, with which President President Trump must now deal. Call it the Axis of Opportunism. To this scene, we must also factor in the jihacfi nonstate outfits, which over the past eight years have made the most of the vacuums created created by Obama’s various retreats. These include al-Qaida and the Taliban, both still going concerns; Islamic State, which thrived when Obama withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq and for too long dismissed the dangers; and the terrorist-infested terrorist-infested misery of today’s Libya, where Obama led from behind. Claudia Rosett, The Hill JOHN J. KIM/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Memorials like the one erected after four men were shot to death in March outside a South Shore restaurant show the decline of what once was a bedrock black neighborhood. “It should be like Evanston,” urban historian Beryl Satter told the Tribune. She’s right. Squint and you see what ought to be a consummately livable, attractive neighborhood. That is, you can drive through South Shore or Pullman or any other of Chicago’s struggling neighborhoods, neighborhoods, and you can imagine what should be. You can conjure a lifeblood of busy sidewalks and occupied storefronts. Instead, South shore is suffering. Residents Residents like Jennifer and Jason Parks are going elsewhere to raise their families sounded like the punch line to a joke: the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus. Its new co-chairman, Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida, was honored as the 2015 “legislator of the year” by The Humane Society of the United States. The caucus annually participates in the American American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ “Paws for Love” and “Paws for Celebration” events recognizing the work of animal rescue and shelter facilities. Not many politicians are afraid of being seen as too cozy with critters. The caucus also serves as a base of support for legislation Among the many measures introduced this year and backed by HSUS is a bill to update the federal Horse Protection Act by banning methods involved in a cruel practice known as “soring.” It relies on chemicals, mechanical mechanical devices and other means to cause pain in the hooves of Tennessee walking SCOTT STANTIS ®lnl7 because they don’t feel safe. She is a nurse and homemaker, he is an investment banker. banker. They sold their South Shore brick bungalow bungalow (located on the same block where Michelle Obama grew up) after a shooting, they told Tribune reporters. Those kinds of decisions are costly: Without middle-class families invested in the neighborhood, there is no positive momentum. Many businesses won’t dare come, nor will home rehabbers and condo developers. Rising crime has gradually invaded horses, producing a high-stepping gait. The Pet and Women Safety Act would offer grants to domestic violence shelters that let abused women bring their pets. Both bills have already attracted more than half the members of the House as co-sponsors, a tribute to how uncontroversial such efforts have become. Other proposals deserve the same breadth of support. Bills have been introduced introduced to outlaw the use of animals for cosmetic testing, which inflicts misery on them for an obsolete purpose. It is already forbidden in the European Union, India, Israel, Norway and other countries, and personal beauty standards don’t seem to have collapsed. And the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act would make it illegal to buy and sell shark fins, a measure meant to take aim at the already-illegal practice of severing shark fins and discarding the sharks to die — an South Shore. It ranks sixth among the city’s 77 community areas for incidents where one or more people were killed over the past decade, according to an analysis of Chicago Police Department data. Chicago does an efficient j ob of confining poverty to certain parts of the city. As a result, South Shore is a default destination for lowincome lowincome renters who can’t find housing in more affluent areas. The neighborhood took a big step backward during the Great Recession, hit hard by foreclosures. What ought to boost South Shore is Chicago’s healthy job market, with some suburb-based employers moving to downtown downtown or nearby. With Motorola Solutions and McDonald’s relocating to the city, some workers might choose South Shore. So might workers at Method, a soap factory that thrives in Pullman. And plans (yet again) to redevelop the U.S. Steel South Works site on the lakefront offer hope. But big development to anchor these neighborhoods neighborhoods requires big help from City Hall. A singular focus. A consistent commitment to building employment and stable residential residential streets. Regrettably, though, Loop workers are fleeing South Shore. From 2010 to 2014, South Shore lost the most Loop-located jobs of all 77 community areas in Chicago, according to the Metropolitan Planning Council. That was a loss of 413 jobs, a decline decline of 11.8 percent. More than 400 downtown jobs gone from South Shore: That’s likely hundreds of households that took their disposable income elsewhere. By contrast, MPC statistics statistics show that the Near North Side gained 1,505 jobs, the most of any neighborhood. what Satter says is as accurate as it is unfortunate: South Shore couldbe like Evanston, or one of Chicago’s healthy destinations, if it didn’t frighten people away. That’s another tragic cost of all the violence. The question now: How to rescue South Shore and areas like it? idea that has won support even from some people who survived shark attacks. The Big Cat Public Safety Act would prohibit possession of lions, tigers, leopards and the like by private individuals — like the one in Zanesville, Ohio, whose 38 big cats ended up roaming free in 2011, prompting the closing of schools and forcing forcing police to shoot most of the animals. Anyone want to live on a block where someone is housing a 500-pound Bengal tiger? We didn’t think so. There will always be disagreements on where to draw the line between justifiable use of animals and unconscionable exploitation. exploitation. But proposals like these are a testament testament to the growing awareness of the legitimate needs of animals and the importance importance of protecting them.

So recording engineer Brian Schwab presses a button, and, suddenly, the voice of Green Mill owner Dave Jemilo resonates on the sound system in Schwab’s Chicago recording studio. “George is — when was your birthday, yesterday? — 88 years old,” Jemilo is heard telling the Green Mill crowd, during a show recorded live two years ago. “How about that?” continues Jemilo on the recording. “Is he the hippest guy you know?” The audience roars, and then Freeman’s voice booms forth. “Hold it Dave,” Freeman says on the recording. “Dave, I want you to know I’m still young at heart.” And the club bursts into a spontaneous spontaneous chorus of “Happy Birthday.” Birthday.” “You gotta leave that in there, because that’s the Green Mill,” Freeman calls out to engineer Schwab and guitarist Mike Allemana, Allemana, both of whom nod approvingly. approvingly. Thus they begin their work, putting the final touches on an album to be released digitally and on vinyl Aug. 18: “Live at the Green Mill,” featuring the George Freeman/Mike Allemana Organ Quartet with special guest Bernard Purdie.

The lineage lineage includes Von and George’s brother, drummer Eldridge “Bruz” Freeman, who died in 2006, and Von’s son, tenor saxophonist saxophonist Chico Freeman, who returned to the United States last year after more than a decade in Europe.

Rehberg, an Elgin native, opened Side Street Studio Arts with her husband, Tanner Melvin, after moving back to the city about 35 miles west of Chicago in 2012. At 38, Rehberg was seeking a quieter, less saturated place to live and work, but has since produced or collaborated on numerous events and festivals, including the Elgin Fringe Festival and Battle of the Bands, and the city’s annual Literary Literary Festival. The two now run their business with four staff members and interns from a growing number of storefronts tucked in an alley in the heart of downtown Elgin (hence the name Side Street Studio Arts). For 10 years, Rehberg was the artistic director of Core Project, an interdisciplinary company based in Chicago that was perhaps perhaps best known for Going Dutch, a showcase highlighting the female voice in dance, visual art, music and theater. Now in its seventh year, Going Dutch launches this weekend in its new home in Elgin for three full days of cutting-edge exhibits and performances performances featuring work by ALYSSA POINTER/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Guitarists George Freeman, left, and Mike Allemana listen during a mastering session for their upcoming album, “Live at the Green Mill.” Griffin, Richard “Groove” Holmes — well, you get the idea. But Freeman’s career was tapering down when Chicago drummer Mike Reed, who owns the Constellation arts center on North Western Avenue, in 2013 came up with the idea of teaming him with guitarist Allemana (who had played for years with Von Freeman). “Mike called me and said: ‘George, man, Mike Reed had been over in Italy... and the driver was playing (Freeman’s) record in the car,’ ” remembers Freeman.

That’s right, Elgin is getting another arts festival, but it wasn’t always the hip and vibrant “City in the Suburbs” that earns its slogan today. Nestled along the Fox River at the terminus for the Metra’s Milwaukee District West Line, the downtown district was practically empty when Side Street Studio Arts opened in 2013. It now boasts a gallery and theater theater space, co-working artists’ studio and art supply store. While SSSA provides the space and opportunity for Rehberg and Melvin to keep up on their own artistic practices, the organization is really all about the community: hosting classes and workshops for people of all ages, plus gallery openings, live music and yes, festivals. But in order for all that to work, the community must be willing. When I asked Rehberg if SSSA could be successful in a single artistic discipline, she gave an emphatic “no.” Though willing to try almost anything, Side Street has implemented plenty of ideas that just didn’t work. Following the community’s lead and relying on the projects that are consistently consistently successful have been vital to their sustainability. “I think a lot of people see that what we do is building community,” community,” Rehberg said. “Not just in the arts but by bringing humans together in the same place at the same time....

At some points the recording captures Freeman shouting his famous exhortation to the crowd: “Everybody say, Yeah!’ ” At other moments he’s heard turning up the power on his instrument, maniacally ascending the chromatic chromatic scale as if reaching for the heavens. But as Allemana and engineer Schwab listen to one musical snippet after another, Freeman gets a bit frustrated. “I want to hear one song, at least, in its entirety,” he protests. “I can’t tell what’s what.

Each year has required a restructuring restructuring of the business to meet the demands of the community. At the forefront of that restructuring, restructuring, Rehberg says, is the question of what Side Street is doing to and for the region. “Are we the exact thing that starts the gentrification of an recording of Freeman’s “Hoss.” “Fm just tryingto make it right — right George?” says Allemana. “Fm just tryingto figure out what’s going on,” responds Freeman.

The engineer has a lot to do to bring that sound out,” he says, the Green Mill sets having been recorded by David Zuchowski. Zuchowski. Adds Allemana, “My impression impression is I’m certainly happy that it’s finally going to get released.

They asked me if I knew the term chipster — and I said of course: Chicano hipster. And then they asked me if I knew what gente-fication was. And I had to put it together, and I admit I hadn’t heard the term. But there was an LA Times article that brought it into the mainstream — and what it means is, the gentrification gentrification of a Latinx space by upwardly mobile Latinx. And that was fascinating fascinating to me. Q: You lived in Chicago Chicago for a long time. Did you sense that happening happening here in Pilsen or other neighborhoods? A: Yes, and I think that our theater company, Teatro Luna, when we had our space on Canal and 18th Street — you know how artists come into a neighborhood and then the hipsters follow, then the yuppies and then it’s done? So I feel like as Latinx artists, I have some guilt in that. But I had never heard this term before — gente-fication — which is also happening in Portland, Houston, it’s happening in a lot of cities. It’s upwardly mobile Latinx Latinx who want to come back to their neighborhoods neighborhoods where they grew up — or, it’s Latinx moving to LA and looking for a Latinx Latinx neighborhood to live or open a business. Either way, they still become a gentrifying force. It’s so concentrated and evident in everything that’s happening happening right now in the Eastside of LA. Critics Film Festival readies weeklong run at Music Box By Michael Phillips Chicago Tribune It’s a no-brainer for Brian Tallerico, editor of rogerebert.com and the co-producer of the Chicago Chicago Critics Film Festival. He and his fellow Chic agobased agobased critic, Erik Childress, Childress, have been CCFF’s chief programmers for six years now. It’s a logistical challenge. But, he says, it’s worth it. The nonprofit festival opens Friday at the Music Box Theatre with “Fast Color” starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw (“A Wrinkle in Time,” “Belle”) in a dystopian tale of a woman with supernatural powers and government ops on her trail. The film was co-written and directed by Julia Hart; her co-writer, producer and husband, Jordan Horowitz (“La La Land”), is scheduled to join Mbatha-Raw for the local premiere. The festival, Tallerico says, comes together on a $20,000-$30,000 annual operating budget. (The big one in town, the Chicago International Film Festival, Festival, costs a little more than $2 million annually.) At the Music Box through May 10, the CCFF will present 24 full-length narrative and nonfiction titles plus two shorts programs. ‘We’re just doing it because we’re seeing movTHE movTHE CREATORS OF JUNO AND YOUNG ADULT BRING YOU THE YEAR'S SMARTEST COMEDY! % STARTS TODAY IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE CHECK LOCAL LISTINGS FOR THEATER LOCATIONS AND SHOWTIMES CHARLIZE THERON ""TERRIFICALLY ENTERTAINING.""

A: Yes, but only mostly during the filming of the pilot. And that’s where I really took a look at it really, not in a black and white way — I mean, it’s a theme of the show, really. We were filming on the Eastside and there was some pushback, online especially, and they called us out as a gentrifying force.

I’m just trying to see the 30 most interesting films I can (at a festival).

The festival drew inspiration inspiration from WGN-AM host and film critic Nick Digilio’s screening series out at the Muvico (now called AMC Rosemont 18 ) in Rosemont. The Muvico hosted the CCFF initially. ‘We got incredibly lucky that first year,” Tallerico says. ‘We got Sarah Policy, and William Friedkin came in. A24 (the everhotter everhotter distributor behind “Moonlight” and “Lady Bird”) liked us from the beginning. They’ve been generous. Everyone has.” The Music Box has been a comfortable home in recent years, Tallerico says, though rental fees have increased and “filling that big auditorium is a cause of stress. But the theater’s beautiful, and it’s And it worked out. We turned a 99-cent corner store into the bar. The owner really welcomed us — we paid them rent for three months and they were able to close the store and visit with family during during that break. It’s in a really Central American part of Koreatown, which is why it kind of looks right. Q: Sex is a big part of the show. A: I wanted it to not be glossy and glamorized the way TV sex can be. If I get a second season, I want to keep rolling with that. And the queerness — there are codes that people will pick up on that tell you Emma is a top femme and you see how she has sex with a genderqueer person, a nonbinary person. But again, that’s all coded, and you get it if you get it.

We’ve had filmmakers initially hesitant, hesitant, only to turn around and say yes because it’s the Music Box.” Tallerico acknowledges that CCFF remains a unique entity. “There is no other weeklong curated critics’ film festival of new titles,” he says. Some wonder wonder if there’s a reason for that.

(“There are so many children. It’s like Logan, Utah.”) Most solo shows are about leaning leaning into fame; this one is about the aftermath of its deliberate abandonment. We hear of her ferrying her daughter to school and music lessons, navigating her daughter’s teenage, Trump-voting boyfriend, driver’s ed instruction, volunteering there and everywhere, explaining to Syrian refugees why there is a Leaning Tower of Niles on Touhy Avenue, and almost never being recognized recognized in the Hollywood context. At one point she recounts how her daughter, Mulan, one day tells her that the kids on the playground playground have just told the amazed girl that her own mother used to be famous (“less every day” is Sweeney’s answer), which leads the pair into the basement basement to watch “It’s Pat: The Movie” (yes, the character was that big in 1994), which turns out to be even more awful than Sweeney remembered. remembered.

Watch this piece and you come to realize the great value of that rare clutch of older female comics who are less likely to throw bombs at correspondents’ correspondents’ dinners and more likely to contemplate their own selves with humility, humility, a broad view and the wisdom of time. Sweeney talks a good deal about how younger people treat those who are older, about how gray hair affords a cloak of invisibility. They just talk right through you, rendering rendering eavesdropping moot. Which helps you observe. Her show opens with her watching a show in New York and descending a staircase, only to find herself herself staring quizzically at the older woman struggling physically as she simultaneously simultaneously comes down the other side.

708,2093417494,"‘Blindspotting’ adopts a range of tones Oakland, from Page 7 Lopez Estrada, whose videos with Diggs and Casal prepared him well for this project. Diggs and Casal came through Chicago recently to host a screening of the film. The following is an edited transcript. Some highlights from our own interview: The slam intro: “I was a senior when he was a freshman freshman at Berkeley High,” Diggs says. “We met at a high school poetry slam. I thought he was very good. But then I left for college. We didn’t start working together until I came back in ’04. Mutual friends had been suggesting we hang out. Rafael was renting a studio by then, so I went over and we stayed up all night making songs. And we’ve been doing that ever since.” The light turns on: Discovering Discovering the spoken-word poetry and performance scene flourishing in the Bay Area, says Casal, meant “finding that thing I was good at, something that felt good to do. I had so many questions growing up about why school was structured the way it was, and how our community was dealing with everything it was dealing with. Spoken word was away to share ideas, and to hold court among your peers. We were just teenagers trying to figure ourselves out. In the competitive competitive poetry world, I’d work all year, refine, refine, test things out. By 15,16,1 was doing independent study, working a retail job and teaching writing workshops workshops at other high schools. Music and poetry was the light that turned on. It was my gateway-drug art form.” Sound pretty: “I think it saved my life in a lot of real ways,” Diggs says, picking up the theme.

The reason you teach a kid spoken word is that literally nobody gives a (rip) about what they have to say, unless they make it sound pretty. That line’s in the film; Collin says it at the end. It’s a trick. It’s a trick by which young people can go into a room and command command authority. If you said the same thing in plain English, nobody would listen.” The movie in their heads: Long before Diggs was in “Hamilton” on Broadway, and Casal was teaching three years at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the friends and “I think we hove the capacity to take in a lot of tones and emotions at once, and a lot faster ... we didn’t go to film school So we don’t know the rules,” —Rafael Casal collaborators began writing a movie for themselves in between music projects. “Essentially we wrote stories first,” says Diggs. “ ‘Oh, this would be a cool scene for the movie,’ you know. Some were blatantly comic, in the spirit of a raucous buddy picture; others, such as the scene when Miles’ young son toys with a firearm, turn chillingly chillingly serious. “Sticking all those different scenes and moods on top on each other felt most honest,” says Diggs. “It feels true to the Bay Area, which was our North Star the whole time. And that feels true to me. I’ve never felt just one thing at a time. I don’t know if any of us do.” Speed: ‘We’re writers and content creators of a certain certain generation,” says Casal. ‘We’re multi-hyphenate creators with particular attention spans. I think we have the capacity to take in a lot of tones and emotions at once, and a lot faster... we didn’t go to film school. So we don’t know the rules.” Hip-hop musical elements: elements: The “Blindspotting” “Blindspotting” script underwent significant changes over many years, while Casal and Diggs shopped it around. “There were a bunch of different versions,” versions,” says Diggs. “Some were way more verseheavy verseheavy some to the point where they were almost from a musical. That idea’s threaded through there, still, but earlier versions were more overt about the soundscape becoming song. Once we landed this last draft, it became clear that Collin had to do his last speech in verse. And everything everything else in the movie had to justify that. The challenge challenge was, how do you condition audiences? How do you make it feel natural? Where do we show the characters proficient with language?” Mundane virtuosity: “I love a script with a lot of good throwaway lines,” says Casal. “There’s a line when Miles is walking out of the frame, and he says to Val (Janina Gavankar, who plays Collin’s ex-lover and the moving company’s office manager), ‘I’m as moved by your compliment as you are moved by an elliptical.’ It’s not a ‘button.’ It’s just thrown away. The thing about the Bay Area is that we treat virtuosity as mundane. Everything is just: Let’s move on, let’s not dwell on it. And that’s how the movie works.” “Go” time: Eventually greenlighted by Snoot Productions, “Blindspotting” “Blindspotting” was filmed primarily in Oakland last year. The film’s collaborative team bounced ideas around constantly, on the streets where they filmed, right up to the editing room. The work was fast but remarkably remarkably smooth, says Casal. “I’ve done four-day projects projects that felt way more turbulent than ‘Blindspotting’ ‘Blindspotting’ did. We understand the financial side of things, and the logistics of setting up a shoot.” Diggs adds: ‘We all got in on the ground floor, including including the financiers. That’s a particular kind of artistic development. It happens a lot in the theater world; you don’t see it a lot in film. Despite this being the lowest lowest budget I’ve ever worked on (as an actor), and the least amount of time, the shoot was less stressful than most other things I’ve done on camera.” Praise be to “Hamilton”: After Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Miranda’s musical smash opened in New York, and won Diggs a Tony Award for his dual roles of Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson, doors opened. “In Hollywood that was the reason why people wanted me in the room — actual moneymaking entities suddenly coming up to you and asking: What do you want to do?”’ The violence of gentrification: gentrification: Diggs characterizes the gentrification of the Bay Area, Oakland included, as “very tricky to navigate. All this new stuff that you wish had been there the whole time you lived there starts coming in. And then slowly you realize it’s not for you. And you’re being arrested at the Starbucks. And someone’s calling the police on the barbecue party you’ve had every weekend for the past 20 years. Rafael describes gentrification as ‘violent,’ and it is; you’re being pushed out of a thing, a place... when I go back to Oakland now, it feels so different. The context is gone.

This is madness!” Sure, Vesely knows it helps that one of his closest friends and collaborators is Chance the Rapper, who, after befriending the filmmaker in 2012 and then enlisting him to direct several of his music videos, signed on to star as a disgraced werewolf in the artsy, surreal and darkly comedic horror film, which premieres Monday evening at ArcLight Chicago. But that didn’t make things any less unimaginable when Vesely stepped on set in August 2016 to begin filming, more than two years after Chance posted a poster for “Slice” on his Instagram Instagram at a time when the movie was only a spec script. “I was freaking out all the time,” Vesely said of the roughly five weeks spent in Joliet shooting shooting the surreal horror film that plays fast and loose with traditional traditional slasher-film conventions, and whose ironic detachment between life and death, Vesely says, was inspired in part by the George Saunders novella “CivilWarLand “CivilWarLand in Bad Decline.” If the filmmaker was on edge it was due in part to managing a $1.1 million budget, but also because, in addition to the chart-topping rapper-cumnascent rapper-cumnascent actor, he was tasked with giving direction to a host of seasoned actors including Zazie Beets (“Atlanta,” “Deadpool 2”), Paul Scheer (“Veep”), Joe Keery Humanities Festival headliners include Tom Hanks, Abbi Jacobson By Steve Johnson Chicago Tribune Chicago Humanities Festival this fall will feature Tom Hanks, “Broad City” creator Abbi Jacobson and writers Jill Lepore Lepore and Rebecca Traister among its slate of speakers, the organization organization announced Sunday. Treating the festival theme “Graphic!” during its series of events running Oct. 27 to Nov. 11, the speakers will appear in venues from Hyde Park to Evanston Evanston but mostly downtown. Other Fallfest 2018 headliners include former Chicago Symphony Symphony Orchestra conductor Daniel Barenboim, novelist Alice Walker, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and Washington, Washington, D.C., restaurateur Jose Andres. The exact schedule of events (“Stranger Things”) and former “Saturday Night Live” cast member Chris Parnell. “But then again,” Vesely explained explained on a recent morning, flashing a sly, confident smile as he lays waste to a kale salad at a Logan Square restaurant he often frequents, “you have to keep it calm from the top down.” To that end, while his stomach turned on the inside, the filmmaker filmmaker projected confidence on the outside. So much so that at shoot’s end, Parnell expressed his admiration at the first-time director’s easygoing demeanor. The director laughed it off and recalls thinking, ‘Yes! I fooled him!” A healthy dose of self-deprecation self-deprecation and humility notwithstanding, notwithstanding, Vesely is confident in his skill set and has “been working working toward this moment for years.” “Quite legitimately since I was 6 years old, I was self-identifying self-identifying as a director,” said the son of two Army parents — his father is in demilitarization for the Department of the Army, his mother started a career as an Army civilian in 2006. “Which is kind of funny because I didn’t even know what that job meant.” His parents’ employer had Vesely moving around a great deal as a child: he was born in Northwest Illinois before moving moving to Germany and Oklahoma and then settling down as a high school junior in the Quad Cities area. A longtime drummer and heavy metal die-hard while in high school, Vesely assumed music would be his path in life. “Slice” creative consultant Elijah Alvarado, a longtime friend of Vesely’s, remembers meeting the director in a high school photography class at Pleasant Valley High School in Bettendorf, Iowa. Vesely was quiet, “but he was already lightyears lightyears beyond what me and any of my friends were doing in film at that point,” Alvarado recalled. “We were making a ridiculous Turn to Vesely, Page 4 VIANNEY LE CAER/INVISION Actor Tom Hanks will speak at the Chicago Humanities Festival. hasn’t been announced yet, but CHF said the event will kick off with the Chicago Tribune writing writing awards.

IN PERFORMANCE ‘Radio Golf’ ★★★★ August Wilson play suddenly feels relevant Rooted in history, Court Theatre’s complex production captures the challenges of our time By Chris Jones Chicago Tribune I often wish August Wilson would come back to life to help us all make sense of our riven America. I walked into the Court Theatre on Saturday night just hours after watching the Serena Serena Williams debacle at the U.S. Open. In Hyde Park, I found a play that had nothing to do with tennis yet delivered most everything you needed to know about what had just taken place in New York. You just had to know where to look. Rooted in history, Wilson’s beyond-the-grave understanding understanding was far more profound than the instant-reaction commentariat commentariat you likely now are following following on Twitter. It hit me with the power of one of Williams’ own serves. While I’m on that subject, a good deal of “Radio Golf” also is about mayoral races, especially especially their intersection with race. I swear it seemed like Wilson had popped up again with a timely primer on what we all need to think about following the decision of Chicago Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel not to seek an additional term. Rahm, Serena, Lincoln Yards, Amazon, crime, the police, the trade-offs required for economic opportunity. It’s all there in “Radio Golf,” fellow Chicagoans. And explored with Gilmore, from left, and James Vincent Meredith play politically savvy, ambitious real-estate entrepreneurs in “Radio Golf.” complexity. Oh, the bard of Pittsburgh would so have admired and enjoyed director Ron OJ Parson’s Parson’s sparkling production of a play that Wilson never got to see done to his satisfaction, being as he was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2005 just as he was getting the play on its feet at the Yale Repertory Theatre and the Mark Taper Forum. By the time it played the Goodman Theatre on the typically winding winding way to Broadway, Wilson was already dead. As a result of its truncated development, we Wilson students students usually have described “Radio Golf,” which is set in the 1990s and deals with the urban gentrification of historically black neighborhoods, as the weakest of his works (I’ve long used the word “rushed”). I decided Saturday night that this was completely wrong; it just took another decade or more for A, the play to find the right director, and B, actual events to catch up with Wilson’s prescience.

This list is more about taking a minute to salute the shows that rose above the streaming/cable/ broadcast glut and impressed impressed me with their stories, performances, structure and, most of all, left me with a sense of satisfaction. 1. “Barry” (HBO). Wickedly Wickedly funny, deeply felt and unnervingly tense, Bill Hader and Alec Berg’s dramedy about a tormented tormented hit man who accidentally accidentally winds up in acting school is a terrific example of how to push a viewer’s preconceptions: Funnyman Hader turns out to be a remarkably versatile protagonist, protagonist, and Henry Winkler’s Winkler’s work in the series redefines the concept of a comeback. 2. “The Americans” (FX). There’s little left to say, except to salute creators Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg, Weisberg, their writers and certainly their cast (especially (especially Keri Russell, Matthew Rhys, Holly Taylor Taylor and Noah Emmerich) for a near-perfect and emotionally emotionally draining send-off to this superb Cold War family family drama. 3. “Killing Eve” (BBC America). It was sort of a sleeper hit at first, but word quickly spread about Phoebe Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s splendidly splendidly paced, six-part action thriller about a desk-bound American (Sandra Oh) working in a London intelligence intelligence office who begins obsessively hunting for a wily and weird assassin (Jodie Comer).

Brett Johnson and Michael Tolkin’s adaptation (with director Ben Stiller) of this story of two convicted murderers (Benicio Del Toro and Paul Dano) who escaped a maximum-security maximum-security prison in 2015 with the help of a besotted employee (Patricia Arquette) is striking striking for its unadorned quality. quality. It’s a disciplined example example of how a masterful true-crime miniseries can skip the need to play up a theme. 5. “Kidding” (Showtime). Despite my initial worry that David Holstein’s dramedy dramedy about a troubled but beloved kids TV host (Jim Carrey as Jeff, aka “Mr. Pickles”) might bump too close to the sacred memory of Mister Rogers, “Kidding” stands entirely on its own. “Kidding’s” conception of Mr. Pickles’ imaginary world — with puppets and songs — shows top-notch creativity while Carrey gives his most memorable performance in years. 6. “Insecure” (HBO). My interest in what happens to the characters Issa Rae and company have created in this hilarious and sharply observed dramedy continues continues unabated — particularly with the show’s third season, season, in which Rae’s character character leaped before she looked, quitting her job as a social worker, becoming a Lyft driver and testing the patience of friends.

662,2267115203,"The 606 symbolizes city’s struggle 606 , from Page 1 Some residents still remember the old days when gangs and violence were ever present in swaths of Humboldt Park and Logan Square. “(The neighborhood) neighborhood) did not look like this when I was growing up,” recalled Felicia Lewis-Grant, 25, who sat chatting with a friend on the trail’s west end in the same area where Alejandro Aguado was fatally shot last month. But the demographics have changed in both Logan Square and Humboldt Park on the western end of The 606 in recent years, as more affluent white families, young professionals, and trendy restaurants and bars have moved into the neighborhood. As a result, critics say the trail has become emblematic of the city’s struggle to invest resources in cash-strapped neighborhoods, creating a divided playground connected to rising rents, gentrification gentrification and displacement. “The trail really accelerated the gentrification that we were already already seeing,” said Norma RiosSierra, RiosSierra, president and chairman of the Logan Square Neighborhood Association, which initially welcomed welcomed the addition of a linear trail like New York’s High Line, London’s London’s Hogsmill River Park and Paris’ Promenade plantee. The organization has since pushed for city assistance in keeping keeping longtime residents as many are priced out by skyrocketing property property values. “I would say that you still have those systemic issues, issues of difference in status, difference in class, difference in equity that have risen and really have become part of this urban walkway,” said Brandon Harris, an assistant professor professor at the University of Arizona who authored a 2017 study on the trail’s positive impact on crime. “And the question becomes, how do we integrate these things into these diverse communities and facilitate interactions in a way where it benefits everyone involved involved — so it’s all about that equitable distribution of this really, really wonderful resource that the city of Chicago and other cities are trying to provide to everyone.” Early successes Although more than 1 million trips were counted on the trail last year, traffic dipped in 2017 and 2018, according to a recent study. Those who spearheaded die project suspect the dip can be attributed to the loss of novelty and fewer tourists. Researchers at the University of Minnesota and the US. Department Department of Agriculture Forest Service in Evanston looked at use and traffic on the trail during the past three years of operation. The western end of the trail saw about a 16% decline in cumulative trail traffic (from 1.2 million in 2016 to just over 1 million in 2018), the paper said. On the eastern end, traffic declined about 12% (from nearly 1.4 million in 2016 to just over 1.2 million in 2018). And usage for the first five months of 2019 is tracking closely and surpassing 2018, said Aaron Koch, the Chicago area director of the Trust for Public Land, the San Francisco-based nonprofit that helped bring The 606 to life. Still, the trail has matched and exceeded some of the early organizers’ organizers’ wildest dreams, said Ben Helphand, president of Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail. “It’s used in five or six different ways, from very practical ways of getting to school and work, to recreation and fitness, and building building social connections,” he said. “And this is really one of the things that differentiates it from, say, the High Line, which does not allow bikes.” Helphand said that from the beginning, the trail had a dual purpose of bridging a transportation transportation corridor with neighborhood parks. “And it’s really in my estimation achieved that beautifully,” beautifully,” he said. But to some, The 606 is representative representative of divisions across neighborhoods. neighborhoods. “The trail has kind of taken on a dichotomous feel, or a binary feel,” said University of Arizona professor professor Harris, who noted qualitative data for a forthcoming study has shown some residents stick to one end of the trail. While Bucktown and Wicker Park — at the eastern end of the trail — have undergone years of redevelopment dating back to the 1980s, efforts to renovate Logan Square and Humboldt Park’s industrial industrial and working-class sections sections at the western end have only begun recently. “There’s the reputation of Humboldt Park that has played a part in it, but it’s also some of the things I’ve heard about the aesthetics aesthetics of the trail — vegetation not being as well maintained, graffiti maybe not being cleaned up as quickly as it is on the eastern sides of the trail,” Harris said. “ConARMANDO “ConARMANDO L. SANCHEZ/CHICAGO TRIBUNE PHOTOS Pedestrians and bicyclists use The 606 near the 1800 block of North Marshfield Avenue in Chicago this month. A surveillance camera sits over the elevated pathway near Walsh Park. versely ... you have a lot of the residents from Humboldt Park and some of those longtime residents residents from the neighborhood who ... don’t want to go into those eastern segments of the trail because because they feel as though they’re not welcome or they’re profiled.” Aid. Roberto Maldonado, 26th, said resources are allocated to the park at the expense of surrounding surrounding neighborhoods, and there is also a difference in resources allocated to the western and eastern eastern parts of the trail. For example, there are currently nine security cameras east of Western Avenue and seven cameras to the west, according to the Chicago Park District. “The factor of public safety was not equally taken to heart by the people that were building it, like everything in Chicago,” Maldonado Maldonado said. Hardly a trouble spot In the light of day, The 606’s tranquil setting makes it an easy choice as a meeting place for teenagers or families playing in its parks. Older residents, some in wheelchairs, can often be found enjoying a warm day out. On a daily basis, it narrows to accommodate accommodate the glut of runners, dog walkers and pedestrians. But after dark is another story, according to many. Regular trail users like Jennifer Murphy, of Bucktown, said she enjoyed the convenience and easy passage through the community and felt safe using it most days. “I love it,” Murphy said during a bicycling trip with her young son and his friend. “It’s close to our house, so we can ride (our bikes) without having to go to the lakefront, so it’s quicker to just hop on the trail and hop off and go to dinner somewhere,” somewhere,” she said. But that love evaporates when the sun goes down. “I would not go on the trail at night, regardless of which section,” section,” she said. “I just wouldn’t use it at night.” Fears about personal safety on the trail at night were likely bolstered by the May 28 shooting death of Aguado, 22, a Portage, Ind., man who grew up on the city’s South Side and spent his short life avoiding gangs, according according to his family. Aguado was walking with two other people on the west end of the trail when four strangers asked if they were members of a neighborhood neighborhood street gang, according to the Chicago Police Department. After pressing them on their gang affiliation, one of the assailants shot all three before fleeing on foot. Aguado, father of a 2-year-old daughter, was wounded in the chest and back, and died before police had a chance to speak with him. A surveillance camera on a nearby building captured grainy images of the attackers running away. No arrests have been made, and police believe none of the victims were tied to gangs. After the shooting, police in the two districts that cover the trail noted an ongoing turf war between between two gangs that frequent different sides of the neighborhood, neighborhood, but officers patrolling the path told the Tribune few problems problems unfold during daytime hours, aside from complaints about neighborhood kids riding wildly on the trail. Park District security, working with police, has increased patrol officers around the clock, “with concentrated attention on areas of concern,” spokeswoman Michele Lemons said. Statistics from police suggest it is hardly a trouble spot. Thirtythree Thirtythree criminal incidents — including including the May homicide — have been reported on the trail between its partial opening to the public in January 2015 through mid-June this year, according to police. This includes 11 batteries, 10 robberies, three criminal damage to property incidences and one sex offense, police spokesman Tom Ahern said. A new incident occurred Wednesday when two young men were accused of a noon robbery on the trail’s western end. Two people were arrested and charged with robbery, police said. “It seems like such a positive place, and to hear that someone got killed is just really shocking,” said Camille Harper, 23, of Oak Park, who joined a Bucktown friend to check out artwork mounted along the trail. While the homicide alarmed some trail users, others are familiar familiar with the sight of gang members doing their own patrols for rivals and menacing young people they don’t recognize. A bicyclist from Logan Square chatting with a friend at the trail’s Humboldt Boulevard rest area said he only recently returned to the trail after gang members harassed him and a group of friends last summer. “I was with my sister, and they just started throwing gang signs,” said the man, who asked not to be identified. The neighborhood has changed drastically in the 20 years he has lived there, he said, calling last year’s incident jarring. “I didn’t know people still gangbanged gangbanged around here. I haven’t seen it in a long time so I was surprised.” Other users said the shooting likely would have little impact on their daily routine. “Generally, I would say I feel safe, and I feel safe when it’s well-lit,” said Dan Hagen, 40, of Wicker Park, who exercises on the trail during the day but has ridden his bicycle there as late as 11 p.m. Sitting near the western end of the park as the sun set, Hagen noted the increased awareness by police and residents after the shooting. “I’m a little more watchful, watchful, but that’s just about it. I mean I live in Chicago, where things happen everywhere sporadically, even in some of the more affluent places.” Accelerated gentrification Chatting with a friend at a table near the spot where the young father was fatally shot, LewisGrant, LewisGrant, who grew up in Logan Square, said gangs and violence used to be more prevalent. “Everything is different now. Rent around here is crazy,” LewisGrant LewisGrant said. “It’s mostly Caucasian people now, but back then it was a lot of Hispanic and black and a little bit of Polish. It wasn’t like it is now. “But it’s cool, I don’t mind,” she added. The demographics have changed in some neighborhoods along The 606 and have been accompanied by increasing rents. By late 2016, DePaul University’s Institute for Housing Studies reported reported that home values were rising fast along the $95 million project’s less-affluent western reaches in Humboldt Park and Logan Square. In May 2015, the median sales price for a detached single-family home in Logan Square was $477,500, an increase of 27.5% from two years before, according to data from Midwest Real Estate Data. In Humboldt Park, the median sales price for a detached single-family home was $100,000, an increase of 52% from May 2013. In May 2019, the median sales price for a detached single-family home in Logan Square was up to $785,000, and the median sales price for an attached single-family home like a condo or townhouse was $415,000. In Humboldt Park, the May 2019 median sales price for a detached single-family home was $220,000, more than double the $100,500 price in 2015. The median sales price for an attached single-family home in Humboldt Park was $235,000, compared with $100,188 in 2015. Citywide, the median sales price was $239,900 for a detached single-family home in May 2019 and $323,000 for an attached single-family home. Near the opening of The 606 in 2015, the Tribune reported Mayor Rahm Emanuel called rising property property values “a good thing,” but pledged to protect longtime residents residents from getting priced out. “For the people who have property property there, that’s a good thing,” Emanuel told the Chicago Tribune Tribune in June when asked about gentrification around the trail. “Increased housing values are not a bad thing.” Many of the affordable housing examples Emanuel offered were a mile or more from the trail. “Change is going to come, it’s coming. It’s just whether or not people like me are going to be able to stay here,” said the Logan Square Neighborhood Association’s Association’s Rios-Sierra, 38, a mosaic artist and educator who has lived in Logan Square since she was 8. “I feel very privileged that I can be here, because if my parents had not bought a place, I wouldn’t be able to live here.” Rios-Sierra decried what she called years of neighborhood neglect neglect from city officials that ended only when deep-pocketed outsiders outsiders arrived to “clean up” the neighborhood, while pushing out residents. “It highlights all of the things that are wrong with how the city is managing this. And it makes it easier for them to say ‘This is a good thing. This is going to bring positive change.’ It’s like you’ve ignored us for so long, and now you’re just pushing us out.” Since 2000, Logan Square’s Latino population has fallen by more than 20,000, while its white population has grown by more than 12,000, making them them the majority, according to an analysis by WBEZ. Rios-Sierra, who lives in the home her family bought across the street from James Monroe School, where she graduated from and her son now attends, also pointed out a cultural difference. “As Latinos, we don’t buy homes as investments, investments, we buy homes for stability,” she said. “To give our families that sort of safety net.” For some of the longtime stakeholders stakeholders in the park and trail, The 606 is only one piece of a complicated complicated puzzle causing change throughout neighborhoods, even if it became a prominent symbol. “I think it did accelerate the rate of gentrification, especially for those first couple of years right after it opened,” said Helphand, of Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail. “But I do think that the Bloomingdale Bloomingdale Trail is one of many factors that have contributed to the gentrification gentrification of the Northwest Side.” As the trail was being built, demolition permits spiked in the western neighborhoods. There was also upzoning along Milwaukee Milwaukee Avenue that attracted residents, residents, leading to a “perfect storm.” “It does not happen in isolation,” isolation,” Helphand said. New challenges Now, proponents and critics alike are trying to curb the domino effect of gentrification. “The trail has been almost, in some ways, so successful that it’s caused a high level of desirability and people wanting to live next to the trail,” said Koch, of the Trust for Public Land. “So there is a challenge that is associated with that change and with the success of The 606 that we believe is important for community organizations, organizations, our organizations in the city to be aware of and think about. What are some solutions that are needed to help folks that are dealing with rising property values values and increased housing costs and those issues?” Helphand said he would like to see affordable housing reform citywide. Aid. Maldonado said he plans to reintroduce an ordinance with Aid. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, and Aid. Daniel La Spata, 1st, that imposes steep demolition fees on expanded construction and restricts restricts rezoning to units with a set percentage of affordable housing, with an aim to slow gentrification. Rios-Sierra warned that displacements displacements in 606 communities could make similar projects like the El Paseo project, a proposed 4-mile path that would link Pilsen and Little Village on the Southwest Southwest Side, a harder sell to those neighborhoods. “It’s a cool concept, an elevated pathway, and you’ll see the same fear over there because of all we’ve seen with what happened with The 606,” she said. Projects in other cities, like the 11th Street Bridge Park greenway planned to be completed in 2023 in Washington, DC., are trying to curb gentrification before the trail exacerbates exacerbates it, implementing equitable development plans that address hiring neighborhood residents, stabilizing stabilizing affordable housing and connecting neighborhoods on opposite opposite sides of the river. Right now, near the west end of The 606 trail, a former glove factory that the Trust for Public Land purchased in 2014 is being developed as a public park, as well as 150 units of affordable housing, Koch said. Land acquisition is expected to be completed next month, he added. Koch said there are also conversations conversations about extending The 606 east to connect to the Chicago River. ‘You could get on your bike someday at the west end of The 606 and be in downtown Chicago without hitting a stoplight,” he said.",6/23/2019,"('to', 'the', 'gentrification')","('the', 'northwest', 'side')",[' “But I do think that the Bloomingdale Bloomingdale Trail is one of many factors that have contributed to the gentrification gentrification of the Northwest Side.'], But I do think that the Bloomingdale Bloomingdale Trail is one of many factors that have contributed to the gentrification gentrification of the Northwest Side
422,2284091842,"PERSPECTIVE TERRENCE ANTONIO JAMES/CHICAGO TRIBUNE A construction site in Jackson Park, at the south end of the proposed site of the Obama Presidential Center, shown Wednesday. It’s not too late to move the Obama Presidential Center plan to an alternate site By W.J.T. Mitchell Chicagoans were jubilant on May 12, 2015, when Barack Obama announced that his presidential library would be built on Chicago’s South Side. All the symbolism seemed perfect. A fitting monument to Obama’s historic presidency would be located in the underserved underserved neighborhoods of the South Side, where his political career as a community organizer had begun. After many decades of neglect, major capital investments would bring good jobs, new housing and businesses and renewed optimism to neighborhoods afflicted with crime, poverty, poverty, food deserts and depopulation. The euphoria lasted a little more than a year. In July 2016, the Obama Foundation announced that the library would not be located in an underserved neighborhood such as the site preferred by most experts — the vacant lots adjacent to Washington Park, with their close proximity to a commercially commercially zoned boulevard and easy access to downtown on the Green Line. It would instead be located on more than 19 acres of precious public parkland, in historic Jackson Jackson Park, a national landmark. In the ensuing months, as the problems with this site became increasingly evident, the mood of the community changed from enthusiasm to suspicion and division, and the Obama Foundation abandoned its celebratory mission and undertook an enterprise of damage control and political maneuvering. The community discomfort only rose when the notion that it would be a presidential presidential library was pulled off the table, to be replaced by a vaguely defined “presidential “presidential center” with a gymnasium, a sledding sledding hill and a display of Michelle Obama’s dresses. The mood became still darker when President Obama rejected overtures to sign a community benefits agreement that would ensure local citizens their share Wait and indict Trump when he’s out of office? Not a safe bet Start impeachment inquiry now. By Mike Quigley Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony before two House committees last week showed the American people why an impeachment inquiry is the only option Congress has left. There were few new revelations in Mueller’s testimony, which was not a surprise. surprise. However, something significant occurred during my line of questioning that should not get lost in the course of the lengthy hearing. I asked Mueller to clarify again that he had not recommended indicting the president president on obstruction of justice charges in part because of an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice that states that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Mueller confirmed that this was true. I then asked Mueller if the president — or any president — could be indicted after leaving office. Mueller said that they could. Finally, I asked Mueller what would happen if a president was still in office when the statute of limitations ran out on a crime. On this important question Mueller paused, thought through such a scenario and ultimately didn’t have a ready answer. The statute of limitations for obstruction of justice, a central focus of the Mueller report, is only five years. If the president were to win reelection, and therefore serve a total of eight years in office, the statute of limitations would expire during his presidency. presidency. At its core, the OLC policy, last updated in 2000, claims that a sitting president cannot be indicted because it would underof underof the economic gains. Uneasiness mounted further when around the same time, ambitious plans were announced to replace the current inexpensive facilities in Jackson Park and the South Shore Golf Course with a PGA championship course that would charge higher greens fees and inflict further damage damage to precious nature preserves along the lakefront. The Obama Foundation’s so-called “community outreach” meetings became slick marketing exercises designed to prevent prevent public debate. Uneasiness had turned to anger, and predictable lawsuits were filed. People of good will can differ on these issues. For some, the need for investment on the South Side and the imperative to honor Obama’s presidency outweigh the problems with the site. But is it really necessary necessary to sacrifice a national historic landmark landmark to achieve these goals? Or could they be better accomplished with a simple change of location that will produce greater greater economic benefits and less environmental environmental damage, and fulfill Obama’s historic mission to lift up underserved neighborhoods? neighborhoods? The just-released federal study of the impact is clear in its judgment that the proposed center “will have an adverse effect” on the historic landscape of Jackson Park. A park of this grandeur was not created overnight. It is the work of Frederick Law Olmsted, the most famous landscape architect architect in American history, designer of New York’s Central Park and many other landmarks landmarks throughout North America, from Montreal to San Francisco. It is blessed with hundreds of century-old trees that will be clear-cut under the current plan.

The opinion cites that theoretically, the statute of limitations on a crime could be frozen during the duration of a presidency. However, just as with the rest of the OLC policy, this is merely the opinion of DO J officials, not law. It has never been tested by the Supreme Court and legal experts disagree over whether such a pause is even possible. It would be negligent on the part of Congress, at the very least, to rely on this untested DO J opinion. If the Department of Justice’s current policy means that a president cannot be indicted while in office, office, and the statute of limitations for obstruction obstruction of justice, or any other possible charge, expires while a president is in office, then the president effectively enjoys in close proximity to an underserved neighborhood zoned for commercial development. development. The superiority of the vacant Washington Park site was, in this respect, understood from the outset. The good news is it is not too late. The Obamas can reconsider their plans before permanent damage is done to the park. At this moment of irreversible decision they should think carefully about what both the immediate and long-term results for themselves and the community will be if they bring a wrecking ball to the Jackson Park site. The gentrification of the adjacent Woodlawn neighborhood, its low-income renters already being driven out, will proceed proceed apace. The 19 acres of Jackson Park will be transformed from a beautifully designed (if poorly maintained) public park into a muddy construction site for the next several years, filled with bulldozers and chain-link fences. Four major arteries within and around will be blocked, including the Midway Plaisance going east and Cornell Drive, a major commuter artery. Lake Shore Drive and Stony Island Avenue will require major reconstruction, with all the predictable traffic problems, at a prohibitive outlay of taxpayer money in the hundreds of millions millions of dollars. The proposed “improvements” “improvements” will snarl traffic for several years, and leave a long-term grid worse than the present layout. At the end of this spectacular period of destruction, a 23-story tower will arise from the ruins amid some low-level outbuildings outbuildings with green roofs to remind us of the beautiful park that was once there. Will this be an enhancement of Obama’s legacy, or a permanent stain on his memory? W.J.T.

This policy needs to change immediately. Until it does, President Donald Donald Trump could permanently evade the consequences of his crimes by winning reelection When I speak to my constituents, the word I hear most is accountability. “When will the president be held accountable to the American people?” As a member of the intelligence committee, it is my job to ensure ensure that accountability. As the country and our caucus debate the merits of an impeachment impeachment inquiry, we must examine the systems that would allow Trump — or any future president — to escape it, simply by running out the clock. We said it over and over again during Mueller’s testimony — no one is above the law. But as long as this DO J policy remains in place, we are sending a clear message that, in fact, the president is above the law. I find that unacceptable. Yes, DO J should reverse this policy immediately, and Congress Congress should step in and provide a clear legal standard. However, with a president under a cloud of legitimate legal scrutiny and Republicans in Congress committed to aiding and abetting him, there is only one way to ensure the president is held accountable accountable for his actions: opening an impeachment impeachment inquiry. For all the complaints about the vague conclusions of Mueller’s report, at its heart is one certainty: It’s up to Congress to decide decide what happens next. Rep.

VOICE OF THE PEOPLE Parents who exploit loophole are cheaters Several of the reports about wealthy Chicago-area parents using guardianship guardianship to skirt financial aid rules have stated that the practice is technically legal. I disagree. This seems like a clear case of fraud. Parents are using guardianship to hide their assets so that they can reap financial benefits from state and federal federal taxpayers. This is fraud and should be prosecuted just like the parents who cheated to get their children children into elite schools. — Janice Cody, Chicago Parents’ sacrifice was a lesson Regarding Heidi Stevens’ column “Everyone loses as parents game guardianship,” July 31: My parents both worked multiple jobs to send me and my three siblings to some of the finest universities in this country. Knowing how much it cost them gave me an enhanced sense of responsibility responsibility and moral obligation not to let their hard work go to waste and not skip classes because it cost them some $50 every time I did. (As I explained it to myself.) I felt so guilty that I won over $28,000 in merit-based scholarships due to my hard work as an undergraduate. undergraduate. When I told my parents that I would repay them, they asked only that I do for my children what they did for me. Now my eldest son will be attending university this fall. There is scarcely a day that I don’t feel grateful to my parents for their sacrifices. The benefits garnered by helping their children realize their potential far outweigh the monetary costs to them. — Michael Pravica, Professor of physics, University of Nevada at Las Vegas Juul ads support poison As a decadeslong Chicago Tribune subscriber, I am appalled that a respected respected newspaper with the status and influence of the Chicago Tribune accepts money from Juul for advertisements advertisements about its vaping devices, which contain nicotine and can lead to youth addiction, as well as to cigarette smoking, which kills hundreds of thousands of people each year. Repeatedly in the newspaper, I see massive, full-page ads from Juul disguised disguised as public service messages, when all it really wants to do is sell millions more of its dangerous products. products. With every ad, Juul Labs nearly breaks its arm patting itself on the back. How thoughtful. I’ve got a better idea — why not stop selling its poison altogether? The jury is still out as to just how harmful vaping is or will be. And the Tribune should not stick its head in the sand, pretending it doesn’t know vaping is harmful. It took an act of Congress to force TV, magazines and newspapers to stop running ads for cigarette-makers. Why wait for another another act of Congress for vaping companies? companies? I know advertising revenue for newspapers has dried up due to the internet. Does that mean newspapers have to resort to accepting ads from poison peddlers? — Daniel Kamen, Buffalo Grove Equifax breach deserves outrage I just read that Equifax is going to pay me the whopping sum of $125 for exposing my personal data to criminals criminals for the rest of my life. What a cruel joke on the American consumer. I can’t choose not to do business with Equifax, so what am I to do? Equifax should have been put out of business for such an egregious failure.

Having started by organizing organizing jam sessions at Roosevelt Roosevelt University as a student in 1947, Segal has presented just about everyone who mattered in jazz ever since.

Joey DeFrancesco, the world’s preeminent jazz organist; Dee Alexander, Chicago’s most celebrated jazz vocalist; and several other top-notch musicians are donating their services for an event to help defray Segal’s medical expenses. At 93, he needs 24/7 care at home. “I’m hanging in all right,” says Segal, who plans to attend the marathon concert concert and makes it to the Showcase most Sundays to catch the matinee. “I still have problems walking. I’ll probably be there in a wheelchair. I’ll come out and wave at everybody and say, ‘Thank you.’ ” Once musicians began hearing about the planned concert, they wished to express the same sentiment. “A lot of musicians wanted to come and play, but we don’t have enough time onstage for everyone,” says Wayne Segal, the impresario’s impresario’s son, who now runs the club.

In the early days of Segal’s career, he practically practically was a one-man-band, booking musicians, finding far-flung venues in which to present them, selling tickets at the door and introducing the acts onstage. Back then, in the 1950s and early ’60s, jazz pulsed in bars, clubs, restaurants and hotel ballrooms across the city. “There were clubs up and down Wells Street, even up in Evanston,” remembers remembers Joe Segal, who rented space wherever he could find and afford it. “There was a place where we had to go through a bowling alley, and the jazz room was in back. We did stuff in Gary, Indiana. Indiana. We did stuff in Hyde Park, at the Beehive, and also on campus (at the University of Chicago). We had Miles Davis with John Coltrane. We had clarinetist Tony Scott, who had a young unknown pianist named Bill Evans. “The (touring) guests thought they’d come and play a little. Then they some photos and three brief but illuminating essays essays from people who have known Palazzolo and this city for decades. Don Di Sante, a visual artist who conceived this book and handsomely designed it, writes: “The photos, in their grittiness, reveal an intimacy not always seen in street photography. photography. ... While some of these photos may make you smile, others are hauntingly tragic.” James Iska, a noted photographer and artful writer, provides a trip back into the area’s past to explain explain how and why “this little strip of land has been an important part of the city history from the beginning.” beginning.” He introduces readers readers to such places as the Capitol Hotel, one of the first buildings in the city with an elevator; McGovern’s McGovern’s Saloon, where future gangster Charles Dean “Dion” O’Banion worked as a singing waiter, distracting patrons while his cohorts picked their pockets; and such nearby areas as “Little Hell” and “Towertown.” Warren Leming, a writer/director/musician/ writer/director/musician/ actor, observes in his essay that, “Tom has an artist’s eye, the chops of a flaneur photographer, and the innate ability to find the essence of a complicated city: Chicago.” He also gets wistful, writing, “I miss that world captured in Tom’s lens here... miss its grit and wonder, and its cast of drifters, outcasts, panhandling panhandling hustlers.” None of the book’s photos photos carry captions. None are necessary because they stand on their own, like visual poems, and because Palazzolo contributes short explanatory words. Here is he on the ABC used bookstore: “Its long, narrow aisles filled with heard our guys,” adds Segal, referring to the powerhouse powerhouse Chicago musicians he’d hired to back the visiting visiting stars, such as drummer Wilbur Campbell and multi-instrumentalist Ira Sullivan. “Then they knew they had to blow.” No Showcase venue was more exciting than the one on Rush Street, below the Happy Medium, in the 1970s. After dark, the sidewalks sidewalks were thick with clubgoers dressed to the hilt. People queued up to get into the Showcase, the smoky, cavernous room often packed to capacity. I heard tenor men Zoot Sims and Al Cohn blasting at each other from opposite sides of the room; Teddy Edwards drawing silken lines from his tenor at all tempos; saxophonist Sonny Stitt reminding us what hard-driving bebop was all about (he once tapped the ashes of his cigarette into my beer when I sat at a front-row table — I was honored). Many listeners probably remember the Showcase best from a 15-year run at the Blackstone Hotel, at Michigan Avenue and Balbo Drive, ending in 1995. A new generation of future jazz stars announced their arrival there, among them trumpeter Nicholas Payton, saxophonists David Sanchez and Chris Potter, pianist Danilo Perez and others, as well as the old beboppers Segal always loved most: trumpeters Red Rodney and Sullivan, alto saxophonist Charles McPherson McPherson and so many more. Next came music at 59 W. Grand Avenue and, for the past several years, the jewel box of a club at 806 S. Plymouth Court. “It’s the best room we’ve had,” says Segal, who’s right about that. But, of course, times and tastes change, and Segal knows well what a hard sell jazz can be these days. Marginalized on TV, radio and various pop culture outlets, jazz struggles to reach listeners outside the converts. “The younger people don’t have the background, so they don’t really appreciate appreciate jazz as such,” says Segal. “They’ve gone into rock and rap and all that stuff.” Not all, though. Swing by the Showcase on a Sunday afternoon, and you’ll see parents introducing their kids to the music.

In the meantime, Segal listens to his beloved jazz at home and fields phone calls from the old masters who are still around. “I just talked to Jimmy Heath,” says Segal, referring to a 93-year-old saxophonist saxophonist from Segal’s hometown of Philadelphia. “I knew all those guys from Philly: Red Rodney, Jimmy Smith, Shirley Scott, Benny Colson, McCoy Tyner — a lot of good guys. “Sonny Rollins is still around,” adds Segal of the 89-year-old New York saxophonist. “Sonny called me a couple couple weeks ago. We had a long talk about his time in Chicago. I mentioned a bunch of obscure musicians. musicians. (Back then) he got himself straight and joined Max Roach at the Blue Note.” What has Segal meant to jazz in Chicago? “As far as I’m concerned, everything,” says Wayne Segal. “I remember when jazz was very unpopular in “Playhouse, across the street from the old Criminal Criminal Courts Building.... Instead of soliciting me, I was advised by the strippers strippers to ‘Go home, buy some wine and cheese, invite a girl over to your apartment, and grab hold.’ They must have felt sorry for me, thinking I was too young to be wasting my time there. Middle-aged men who worked in the Loop on the other side of the Clark Street Bridge were their prime customers.” We see photos of the ravaged faces of the people who frequented the taverns and dives that peppered every block, but we do not see inside any of these bars. “Tom rarely frequented them, and anyway, he says, they were too dark to get a good exposure,” Di Sante Chicago, and he kept it going all these years.” Not surprisingly, Segal’s contributions have won various honors, most notably notably a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship, widely considered considered the country’s highest jazz honor. “I’m thankful I was able to do something constructive constructive with my life,” he says. “I had five children, three of whom are still alive, including Wayne. And I have some very lovely grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. greatgrandchildren. “I’m glad I got out of Philadelphia.” If he had it to do all over again, would he? “Yeah,” says Segal. “But I’d try to be smart enough to make some money at it.” Joey DeFrancesco, Dee Alexander, Ari Brown, Henry Johnson, Greg Fishman Fishman and others will perform at 7p.m. Monday at the Studebaker Theater, 410 S.

Most important, the historian, whose report was commissioned by the state, not the foundation, as the editorial erroneously cited, very specifically said he had not concluded the hat wasn’t Lincoln’s, so the editorial’s headline and conclusions are inappropriate and misleading. misleading. State Historian Samuel Wheeler did uncover some additional information supporting the provenance of the hat while criticizing others that had been previously cited by the state and the foundation. Lastly, he said more research was needed to further solidify the hat’s provenance, steps the foundation fully supports. In addition, the editorial omits other salient facts Tribune readers deserve, including the fact that the foundation was faced with a difficult choice in 2007: Either incur substantial indebtedness, which has since been substantially paid down, to support the state’s request that we urgently acquire the hat and entire Taper collection (there was no a la carte option) or allow what was arguably the world’s largest collection of Lincolnania Lincolnania to be auctioned off and disappear from the public domain forever.

Trump takes out Iran’s architect of mayhem. Can he de-escalate? Immediately after the Pentagon confirmed Thursday night that an American military airstrike in Iraq had killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Revolutionary Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, a political debate broke out back home. This was either a decisive, necessary US. operation — or a dangerous dangerous gambit. As with many actions undertaken by President Donald Trump, assessments assessments depend greatly on how much faith one places in Trump’s judgment. judgment. Issues of national security shouldn’t be partisan; protecting the country should be everyone’s business. business. But Trump’s blend of braggadocio braggadocio and unorthodox impulses makes him appear either bold or irresponsible. Statements from the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House suggested the US. military had justification for taking out Soleimani, the Iranian military’s general in charge of murderous mischief and unquestionably an enemy of the United States. Secretary Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a planned attack on Americans had been “imminent” before the drone strike. The Pentagon said it went after Soleimani for “actively developing plans to attack American diplomats @Ramireztoons Ife DWAYitttd H19 PUMMY michaelpramirez.com MICHAEL RAMIREZ/THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING For more than a decade, leading urbanists and their media disciples have touted the idea that a resurgence of cities was occurring at the expense of suburbs, a trend that amounted to a historical reversal of American living preferences. The revival of some central business districts districts and the gentrification of old industrial neighborhoods neighborhoods into hip new urban enclaves fed a back-to-the-city narrative, while an exodus of the poor into nearby suburbs suburbs and a Great Recession-era plunge in housing values sparked conjecture that the classic suburb was in decline. Comprehensive research tells a different story. While the demographics of cities and suburbs are changing, changing, the suburbs have continued to outperform urban neighborhoods on multiple economic and demographic variables, solidifying their hold on American wealth and and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.” That sounds plausible, though gauging justification justification for Soleimani’s death would be easier if the Pentagon or the State Department provide more details about such plans. What’s especially hard to assess is whether eliminating a powerful military adversary will make the Middle East a safer or a more dangerous dangerous place for Americans and American interests. Tehran has already vowed to retaliate, and in the short term, the Iranian general’s death raises the risk for US. troops, government workers and even civilians civilians in Iraq and other parts of the region. In the long term, though, Soleimani’s death hurts Iran because he was the mastermind of Iranian adventurism. Soleimani had a long history of American blood on his hands. His forces in Iraq were responsible for killing hundreds of American troops during the Iraq war. Soleimani also supported the rise of Hezbollah as a Lebanon-based terrorist organization, organization, and he protected Syrian strongman strongman Bashar Assad. According to the Pentagon, in recent months Soleimani orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq, including the Dec. 27 attack that killed an Ameristatus. Ameristatus. The good news is that the urban revival in many places is real. The better news is that it hasn’t come at the expense of other communities. The data, then, seem at odds with the typical media narrative. Gentrification of some city neighborhoods by young hipsters fostered an idea that educated millennials were rejecting their suburban upbringings to reclaim the city. But as they age, millennials are turning out more like their parents than previously thought. As demographer Wendell Cox has shown, even when these young people gravitate toward major metropolitan regions, they’ve been more likely to live in outlying areas than in central cities. Similarly, anecdotal stories of retirees ditching the ’burbs for city living exaggerate the trend. Steven Malanga, City Journal can contractor. The United States and Iran have been in a standoff for years. The highest priority has been to curb Iranian nuclear ambitions, but Iran’s shadowy military moves represent an ongoing threat to US. security and interests across the Middle East. In recent months, Iran has stepped up its provocation campaign, campaign, largely in response to the sanctions squeeze that Trump has put on Tehran, part of a broad effort to quell Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iranian mine attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz were followed by missile strikes on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure. Iran undoubtedly is weaker now that Soleimani is dead. And there’s other bleak news for Tehran in this assault: the realization that US. intelligence was able to penetrate Soleimani’s security bubble and hit him as he was leaving Baghdad’s main airport. What’s unanswerable at this point: Does killing Soleimani lead to retaliatory strikes by Iran that demand demand reciprocal responses from the US., or can a perilous escalation be avoided?

Kamin Continued from Page 1 uber-chic former elevated railroad line on Manhattan’s Manhattan’s West Side. Cities everywhere, including including Chicago, are trying to duplicate its popularity and avoid its pitfalls, including including the gentrification of adjoining neighborhoods. neighborhoods. A recently issued study of the central Loop by commercial real estate brokers Cushman & Wakefield Wakefield floats the idea of inserting a High Lineinspired Lineinspired elevated walkway through the heart of LaSalle Street. But unlike the High Line or Chicago’s 606 trail, which exude authenticity because they’re built on age-old elevated rail lines, the LaSalle Street walkway would be entirely new — more wanna-be cool than the real thing. Renderings by a littleknown littleknown interior designer, Frank Botello, imagine sinuous pathways that hug the building facades and appear to run the entire length of the canyon, from Wacker Drive on the north to Jackson Street on the south. Pedestrians would climb stairs at the LaSalleWacker LaSalleWacker intersection to an over-the-street platform that leads to the walkway. In some spots, the walkway walkway would cover the street, shutting off views of the iconic Chicago Board of Trade Building from street level. Welcome to Lower LaSalle! The pathway would combat the perception that LaSalle is a stuffy, “old school” street lined by intimidating temples of finance, the study claims. ‘With thoughtful modification,” modification,” it goes on, “LaSalle Street can become the live-work-play nucleus of the Central Loop.” Sorry, but LaSalle needs help like this like a 401(k) investor needs a stock market crash. It’s radical elective surgery that would mar a singular ensemble of skyscrapers. The LaSalle Street canyon canyon presents a dazzling array of styles, from the suave Art Deco of the Board of Trade to muscular classicism of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it’s “the only remaining, cohesive collection” that illustrates the development of Chicago’s downtown core, according to the National Park Service, which monitors the register. register. Plop an elevated walkway walkway in this sublime canyon and you would mar the beautifully detailed ground-level facades of LaSalle’s buildings, throwing throwing them into perpetual, Lower Wacker gloom. The street would be rendered virtually unrecognizable. I could go on, but why bother? The study, titled ‘What’s Next for Chicago’s Central Loop?” and issued in October, has no official backing. After I raised my objections, its authors beat a hasty retreat and characterized characterized the elevated walkway walkway plan as a mere conversation conversation starter. So what’s abetter response response to the central Loop exodus, which has longtime longtime corporate tenants fleeing to shiny new skyscrapers skyscrapers along the Chicago River or entirely new office markets like the Fulton Market district? First, don’t panic. Some short-term loss of tenants was probably inevitable, inevitable, though it remains to be seen how quickly the vacant spaces fill up — or don’t. As Eleanor Gorski, who leads the downtown efforts of Chicago’s planning planning department, told me, city officials purposely expanded high-rise zoning beyond the traditional downtown core so Chicago would have a fresh supply of state-of-the-art office space. One trend could counteract counteract the dispersal of corporate office tenants: The conversion of aging office buildings to residential residential use. The number of people living in the greater downtown area now likely exceeds 230,000 — about three-quarters of the entire population of Cincinnati. In addition, small startups startups and co-working offices are filling some of the empty space. Turning office buildings into apartments helps avoid the trap of a financial district that goes dark at 6 p.m. It spreads activity and energy use through the day, making better use of existing existing infrastructure. But to achieve such benefits, the downtown needs better amenities for residents, like a big grocery store and open-air cafes, according to the Cushman & Wakefield Wakefield study. Chicago architect Gordon Gordon Gill, co-author of an award-winning 2011 plan to reduce downtown’s carbon footprint, said: “It’s good to see what the market market does. On the other hand, my suggestion would be to have a strategy: to define the market, not let the market plan for us.” That’s good advice, particularly because the city’s Central Area Action Plan, adopted under former former Mayor Richard M. Daley, is more than 10 years old and was based on the even older 2003 Central Central Area Plan. New thinking is needed to confront the realities, risks and priorities of the present: From the environmental environmental threat posed by climate change to calls for downtown housing to be made available to a wide range of income groups, not just those making sixfigure sixfigure salaries. Fresh attention also needs to be devoted to tweaking existing public spaces, like Daley Plaza and the other great outdoor outdoor plazas along Dearborn Dearborn Street; they can serve both office workers and residents who want a nice place to sip a latte. In short, the way to confront the central Loop’s looming vacancies is to build carefully on existing strengths, rather than reach desperately for a hideous quick fix that would destroy one of the city’s great urban spaces.

139,2369218913,"BASEBALL CHRIS SWEDA/CHICAGO TRIBUNE White Sox prospect Nick Madrigal isn’t sure if he’ll be on the major league roster on Opening Day, but he is among the candidates to take over as the team’s full-time second baseman. SOXFEST TAKEAWAYS Second to none White Sox have an interesting choice to make at 2nd By LaMond Pope SoxFest wrapped up Saturday. And spring training is up next, with pitchers and catchers set to report on Feb. 12. Here are three storylines as the White Sox prepare to head to Glendale, Ariz. 1. Which starting positions are up for grabs? Luis Robert’s six-year, $50 million deal puts him in line to be the team’s opening-day center fielder. That would leave second base as the one spot to be determined. The Sox non-tendered Gold Glove winner Yolmer Sanchez in December, creating the opening. Leury Garcia, Danny Mendick and highly touted prospect Nick Madrigal are among the options. All three are excited about the opportunity. “I got an opportunity and I’m always going to try to take advantage of every opportunity I can,” Mendick said Thursday. “It’s been a different kind of a route for me. There’s an opening there and I’m going to do everything everything I can to take that. I’m excited.” Mendick hit .308 in 16 games as a September call-up. Garcia is the veteran of the group.

What’s next for Michael Kopech? Kopech missed all 2019 while recovering from Tommy John surgery. The right-hander, who is the No. 20 prospect in baseball, according to MLB Pipeline, said Wednesday: “Physically, I feel great. Better than I probably have felt my entire baseball career since I was drafted.” General manager Rick Hahn talked about what’s next on Thursday. ‘We’re excited to see Michael back healthy and on the mound,” Hahn said. “He obviously has completed his rehabilitation and will report to spring training from a health standpoint like any other pitcher in the system. That said, we have to be mindful of the fact that it’s been over 18 months since he’s faced any big-league hitters. And even 18 months ago prior to the injury, he was still a bit of a work in progress. ‘We still think the world of him and think he’s going to play a very large role on very good ballclubs for a long time here, but we also have to understand where he is and what foundation he’s building on after missing the 2019 season. He’s going to come to camp. We’re going to see him live. We’re probably going to smile and we’ll come up with the precise plan for managing his workload over the course of his first year back, come Arizona.” 3. How will new hitting coach Frank Menechino affect the team? The Sox made two offseason offseason changes to the coaching staff, naming Frank Menechino hitting coach and Scott Coolbaugh Coolbaugh assistant hitting coach. Menechino spent 2019 as the hitting coach for Triple-A Charlotte. Charlotte. The Knights led the International International League in runs with 792, were second in on-base percentage percentage (.352), slugging percentage (.472) and OPS (.824). He also spent some of September with the Sox. “I don’t know if the philosophy will change,” Sox manager Rick Renteria said. “I think it’s just maybe more that guys gravitate a little bit more to Franky in terms of his communication and ability to articulate something in a different way that might get you hopefully the successes that you want to have. “Franky’s impact in many ways is his energy, he’s straightforward. straightforward. He’ll go about ways of trying to get things out of guys just like everybody does. And his energy and ability to put together a plan for these guys, I think, is going to be impactful in many ways.” Sullivan Continued from Page 1 run, won a World Series. That’s what we’re trying to get to. We’ve been around. Sports is cyclical and you go through these. Hopefully Hopefully our window is opening up, and it’s opening up for a long time.” This is a milestone season for the Sox, who will have to carry NBC Sports Chicago this summer with the ratings-dominant Cubs starting their own network. One NBC SC H employee referred to the Cubs as the “enemy” at the Cubs Convention, though the station co-owned by the Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks still plans to cover the Cubs evenhandedly and is searching for a beat writer for its website. Still, this year could be significant significant for the Sox in creating inroads inroads in the attention gap with the Cubs, who have owned the town for a few decades and have the built-in advantage of playing in iconic Wrigley Field. Sox Park will never be a tourist trap like Wrigley, but the difference difference in the actual game-day experience experience on the North and South Sides has been shrinking. By adding more night games over the years and entering the video age in 2015, Wrigley has most of the same features as any other park. The ivy-covered walls and handoperated handoperated center-field scoreboard are the only vestiges from the old days. What the Cubs have that the Sox don’t is a neighborhood full of pre- and postgame dining options, which has only increased recently with Wrigleyville being transformed into a clone of River North. That won’t soon change, so the Sox will have to be creative to add ordinary baseball fans with no strong allegiance to their diehard fan base. “The White Sox had long ago tested the loyalty of their rooters,” former owner Bill Veeck once wrote. “The weak and faint of heart had fallen by the wayside, and only the strong, the dedicated and the masochistic remained.” Many of those dedicated Sox fans feel media outlets, including the Tribune, have always been pro-Cubs in their baseball coverage, coverage, a perception Veeck helped create. Veeck grew up working at Wrigley and famously helped plant the ivy. But during his second second Sox ownership stint in the 1970s, he loudly complained about the disparity in coverage, telling then-Sun-Times baseball writer Jerome Holtzman in 1978 the Cubs had twice as much coverage in the Tribune. “I’m tired of scuffling around,” Veeck said. “I’d take the franchise out of here if the chance came along. The Tribune is trying to bury us.” Tribune sports editor George Langford answered back in an article on June 16,1978, headlined ‘We like your style, Bill, but these are the facts.” Langford measured the stories from March 1 to midJune midJune and found the Sox had 1,803 column inches of story type to the Cubs’ 1,427 inches. “Chicago is indeed fortunate to have Bill Veeck,” Langford wrote “And if it were true that the Tribune Tribune — or any other sector of the media — gave such one-sided treatment to Chicago baseball, I would be just as indignant as Veeck. However, Bill Veeck was misinformed.” Veeck would be out of baseball in three years and the Tribune hired Holtzman. But the debate over media coverage never waned. It heated up in 1981 when Harry Garay bolted the Sox TV booth for the Cubs and spread the gospel of day baseball on WGN. The ‘Winning Ugly” Sox had the town’s undivided attention in ’83 before the ’84 Cubs snatched it back. The last time the Sox outdrew the Cubs was in 1994, the year the players strike led to the cancellation cancellation of the end of the season with the Sox in first. Various theories have emerged to explain the Cubs’ annual dominance as a drawing card in Chicago, including including Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf’s Reinsdorf’s role as a “hawk” in the ’94-95 labor dispute, the steep upper deck at new Comiskey Park, the rise of Sammy Sosa on the North Side and the continued gentrification of Wrigleyville. The myth of Chicago turning into “SoxTown” began in 2011 after Cubs President Crane Kenney Kenney and general manager Jim Hendry were booed at the Cubs Convention. A Sun-Times columnist columnist used Cubs fans’ discontent discontent as an example of the team’s growing irrelevance, and pointed to the Sox’s signing of free agents Adam Dunn and Jesse Crain as the final straw, declaring “for the first time in decades, this town belongs to the White Sox.” But the 2011 Sox went bust, finishing 79-83 and leading to the departure of manager Ozzie Guillen, who bickered with general general manager Ken Williams during during an acrimonious season. The Cubs were awful as well, precipitating precipitating the firing of Hendry and the installation of the Theo Epstein Epstein regime. One year later, in January 2012, the creator of “SoxTown” “SoxTown” conceded he’d jumped the gun with a column headlined: “I was wrong, it really is a Cubs town.” The Sox set an all-time attendance attendance record in 2006, the year after the winning the World Series, Series, drawing 2.957 million. But the Cubs, in the last gasp of the Dusty Baker era, still outdrew them with 3.123 million fans. The Sox fell under 2 million in attendance attendance in 2012 and have yet to return. return. The divide grew even deeper with the Cubs’ 2016 championship and the Sox’s decision to rebuild. Now the rebuild has turned a corner, and since no newspaper idea is worth completely discarding, discarding, a one-word headline appeared appeared during the Cubs Convention Convention asking the same old question: “SoxTown?” Boyer insisted the Sox are only concerned with satisfying their fans, not converting disgruntled Cubs fans. They may one day own the town again, but first they have to start winning and make a trip to the South Side a “must-see” experience. “The reality is this,” Boyer said. ‘What does every great marketing marketing plan start with? A great product. product. And now we’ve got guys that we can put out front. You’ve started to see it already. ‘We hit (an advertising) spot on mentality. We hit a spot on perception. And now we’re going to put the guys out front. They’re going to connect to the fan base better. We’ve talked to the guys about this campaign and said: ‘Does this feel like us?’ Let’s go with it.” The battle for the hearts and minds of Chicagoans will be something to watch as the Sox window allegedly opens in 2020 while the Cubs’ window is in danger of closing. But new Sox slugger Yasmani Grandal believes there’s room for everyone. ‘We’re not looking for attention,” attention,” Grandal said. ‘We’re just looking for success. If, at the end of the day, we can have a Chicago Cubs-Chicago White Sox World Series, that’s great for us. We’re going to be sleeping in our own beds.”",1/27/2020,"('and', 'the', 'continued')","('wrigleyville', 'the', 'myth')","[' Various theories have emerged to explain the Cubs’ annual dominance as a drawing card in Chicago, including including Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf’s Reinsdorf’s role as a “hawk” in the ’94-95 labor dispute, the steep upper deck at new Comiskey Park, the rise of Sammy Sosa on the North Side and the continued gentrification of Wrigleyville.']", Various theories have emerged to explain the Cubs annual dominance as a drawing card in Chicago including including Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorfs Reinsdorfs role as a hawk in the 9495 labor dispute the steep upper deck at new Comiskey Park the rise of Sammy Sosa on the North Side and the continued gentrification of Wrigleyville
824,2430655976,"(Clucacja tribune PERSPECTIVE Why EGA is suing the City Council By Marie Dillon The public bickering over who illegally taped (and then leaked) a private conference call between Mayor Lori Lightfoot and city aldermen misses the larger point: The call itself was illegal. It wasn’t the first one either. Since at least March, Lightfoot and her aides have held similar “informational updates” with aldermen about City Hall’s response response to the COVID-19 public health emergency and, more recently, about its handling of local protests stemming from the death of George Floyd during an encounter with Minneapolis police. “These updates were arranged and carried out solely for the administration to convey information information about the status of COVID-related efforts and field questions on those efforts,” according according to a statement from the mayor’s spokesperson. “For a meeting to be subject to the Open Meetings Act, it must include deliberation (for example, legislative legislative debate) and/or action (for example, a vote), which did not occur on these calls.” Lightfoot surely knows better than that. So do aldermen, who by law are required to complete an online training course on OMA, administered by the attorney attorney general’s office. NANCY STONE/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Frank Chapman, field organizer for a Civilian Police Accountability Council, speaks out for community input into police Oct. 4, 2016, at City Hall in Chicago. Mayor, if you don’t have a plan, I do By Raymond A. Lopez Chicago needs a plan. By now the entire nation has seen and heard how Mayor Lori Lightfoot not only failed to have a plan to protect protect Chicago’s 77 communities, but also steadfastly refused to listen to my concerns and my colleagues’. The real story is not about profanity. profanity. It is not about who taped what and who leaked it. The real and unforgivable unforgivable story is that Lightfoot failed our city for failing to create a plan to protect protect Chicago and its people. So let’s go back to the original question question that started it all: Mayor, what’s the plan? While she waits for her out-of-state advisers to respond, I offer this plan for recovery to heal our city as one. First and foremost, we cannot allow the true reason for the demonstrators to get lost amid the chaos: the murder of George Floyd and the unanswered goal of police accountability. Chicago has two ordinances addressing civilian oversight: One would create a Civilian Police Accountability Council and one proposed by the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability. Both have community support. Both have languished languished in City Council for years. We need to take the hard vote now ANTONIO PEREZ/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Mayor Lori Lightfoot speaks Thursday about how Chicago police officers officers made popcorn and coffee in U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush’s office. Here’s a refresher: The Open Meetings Act says citizens have a right to attend “all meetings at which any business of a public body is discussed or acted upon in any way,” except under limited and specific circumstances. Even if those circumstances exist, a meeting can’t be closed to the public without a majority vote, taken in an open meeting. In a lawsuit filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court, the Better Government Association asked a judge to order the City on true police accountability. We must restore people’s faith in law enforcement enforcement by removing the bad apples and showcasing the thousands of good officers that report to duty every day. Second, Chicago can no longer ignore the racial inequities that have been roadblocks to success for black Chicagoans. After the 1960s riots, it wasn’t until the last five years that investments really returned to the long-ignored West Side. We cannot again allow decades to go by before taking action. The South and West sides of Chicago, home to predominantly predominantly African Americans, cannot be left without a targeted and expansive effort to help lift them up firmly in the middle class. I propose tweaking Lightfoot’s Invest South/West initiative to encompass encompass existing businesses, helping them stay in the communities they served before the devastation related to the looting. If they are excluded, this program will hasten the gentrification gentrification of the neighborhoods it is meant to serve. Third, Chicago must take the lead in demonstrating its true commitment to inclusion and reform by having its internal hiring and department contracting contracting goals match the demographics demographics of our city. In 2010, African Council to follow the law. The suit notes that the closed telephonic telephonic meetings “violated nearly every meaningful OMA requirement.” requirement.” There was no public notice notice of the meetings and no agenda. There was no opportunity opportunity for citizens to observe or comment. comment. There was no vote to close the meetings to the public. The suit also asks the court to order the release of any written minutes or audio recordings of these meetings. To prevent the spread of Americans accounted for 33% of our population, yet Chicago’s contract diversity participation goals for all minorities is only 26%. That policy forces African Americans, Americans, Latinos and others to needlessly fight against each other. Chicago must immediately change this policy, striving striving for goals that reflect the ethnic/ racial demographics of this city as determined by the U.S. census. Based on 2010 data, that means an African American participation goal of 33%. These goals should also be updated every 10 years based on those numbers. numbers. Fourth, Chicago must open bars, restaurants and businesses quickly, fairly and equitably. While Lightfoot has embraced my idea of expedited sidewalk cafe permits, there is much more we can and must do to ensure businesses outside of downtown can also participate in the economic reopening reopening of the city. Along with issuing permits faster, let’s be creative, linking food trucks and taverns to allow both to open quickly. We must waive fees and allow businesses without prior complaints to self-report inspections in order to open more quickly. Chicago Chicago must cut the red tape and bring relief to our local small business owners. owners. COVID-19, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has loosened the OMA requirement for public bodies to meet in person. person. But the other requirements remain in place. Yet aldermen have repeatedly joined in the calls from which their constituents were excluded. There is, after all, a lot to talk about. On a March 30 call, aldermen pressed the mayor for details on what the city was doing to help people who’d lost their jobs because because of COVID-19, for example, and steps local businesses could take to enforce social distancing by customers. The public learned about those discussions because someone leaked a recording to ProPublic a’s Mick Dumke. A May 31 call focused on the city’s preparations to combat looting and vandalism in neighborhoods neighborhoods after protesters had been pushed out of downtown. At one point, Lightfoot traded profanities profanities with Aid. Raymond Lopez, 15th. The Sun-Times’ Fran Spielman reported on that exchange exchange the next day, and a complete complete audio recording of the meeting meeting has since been shared all over social media. At a news briefing June 10, Lightfoot intimated that Lopez had leaked the recording — Lopez denied it, sort of — and lamented that the breach would inhibit “candid conversations” among Fifth, there are 12,000 vacant cityowned cityowned lots across Chicago in both residential and commercial areas. We need a comprehensive land-use policy determining what best use of these properties should be. Let’s allow acquisition acquisition of vacant lots by their resident resident neighbors. Let’s build affordable housing. Let’s create retail storefront pop-up or shared spaces? Most importantly, importantly, let’s put these lots back on the tax rolls. Lastly, a complete independent forensic audit of Chicago’s revenues and budget is required to determine the economic impact the devastation caused by the pre-pandemic real estate downturn, the coronavirus pandemic and now the recent assault on our city. We must be honest with the people of Chicago about the state of our city’s finances. Politicians make lots of promises often without thinking thinking how to pay for them. There are many great ideas here and elsewhere that can get Chicago back on track, but they will remain only ideas if we cannot pay for them. Chicago can and must heal as one city. Anything less would be a failure of this moment. Raymond A. Lopez is alderman of Chicago’s 15th Ward. elected officials. “There are a lot of incredible emotions that were shared on that call by fellow aldermen,” Lightfoot said. “Now all of them don’t feel secure or safe coming together with their colleagues because of one individual who decided to illegally tape a conversation conversation that was intended to be a private conversation among all of us.” A private conversation among all of us. Think about that. Granted, we’re all feeling a bit ragged these days. The responsibility responsibility to protect constituents no doubt weighs heavily on public servants. But citizens have a right to monitor the performance of their elected representatives and hold them accountable. And challenging times call for more public scrutiny, not less. In the current state of emergency, emergency, Lightfoot wields extraordinary extraordinary authority, and the recordings show some aldermen pushing back against her exercise of those powers. These are all important conversations, conversations, and citizens are entitled to be in the room (or on the call). They shouldn’t have to rely on a leaked recording of a secret meeting. meeting.

213,2603326164,"Kevin Costner in Yellowstone. Three shows related to the series are set for Paramount+. CAM MCLEOD/PARAMOUNT NETWORK ‘Yellowstone’ leading the charge at Paramount+ 6 new shows from creator could boost streamer’s growth By Ryan Faughnder Los Angeles Times As Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. were recombining in 2019, Chris McCarthy faced a key decision: What to do about “Yellowstone”? After leading VH1 and MTV, the Viacom television executive executive had recently added “Yellowstone’s” cable TV home, Paramount Network, to his portfolio, portfolio, along with Comedy Central. The neo-Western drama, starring starring Kevin Costner as powerful powerful Montana ranch owner John Dutton, was popular but expensive to produce. Basic cable was abandoning scripted drama in favor of cheaper reality reality shows. What’s more, the streaming rights were committed committed to a rival, Comcast Corp.’s Peacock, presenting a problem for ViacomCBS’ own nascent streaming streaming ambitions. Instead of cutting the show, McCarthy came up with a plan to expand “Yellowstone” and deepen ties with its creator and director, Taylor Sheridan. The result was a deal for Sheridan to create six shows — including including three “Yellowstone”-related programs — exclusively for Paramount+. Paramount+. Kogan from Page 8 It was not a happy family and eventually a divorce took Roy and his mother to Rogers Park where they lived, she would marry five times. He went to grammar school, played a lot of sports and began to discover life and its many characters and revelations, revelations, and girls. His father died of cancer when Roy was a teenager and soon the kid leaves town with the notion to “go everywhere.” everywhere.” There is nothing sentimental about this remarkable story, this film. It is marvelously moody, with a jazz infused soundtrack by Jason Adasiewicz, and employing employing the voices of actors Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon and Lili Taylor, and with striking animation animation by Lilli Carre and Kevin Eskew. It is a vanished city we see, brought to vivid life by the use of ‘We decided to take the harder path,” said McCarthy, president and chief executive of MTV Entertainment Group. “It would certainly be challenging, but the reward would be exceptional.” The strategy faces a major test Nov. 14 with the premiere of Sheridan’s new show, “Mayor of Kingstown,” a Michigan-set drama about the business of incarceration, starring Jeremy Renner, Dianne Wiest and Kyle Chandler. In December, Paramount+ Paramount+ will stream the first “Yellowstone” spinoff, “1883,” a prequel starring Sam Elliott and country music stars Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. Both series will kick off by running their first two episodes on Paramount Network after episodes of “Yellowstone.” After two episodes, the shows will move exclusively to Paramount+. Upcoming projects in the Sheridan oeuvre include another “Yellowstone” spinoff, “6666,” plus “Land Man,” a series about the West Texas oil boom and bust, inspired by a Texas Monthly article. article. The strategy is risky. With their big-name stars and epic vistas, Sheridan’s productions are pricier than the typical basic-cable series. His shows cost an average of $6 million to $8 million per episode to make, according to people familiar with the series’ finances. The first season of “1883,” which was launched quickly and archival photos and film clips. I have been reading Gifford for most of my adult life and greatly admire his 40-some works. He is perhaps most famous for what are labeled his Sailor and Lula novels, a series that inspired filmmaker David Lynch’s “Wild At Heart,” the 1990 romantic crime film that Lynch wrote and directed with stars Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern and Diane Ladd. Rob Christopher first saw that film as a teenager in Denver, his hometown. He says, “I had to see it on VHS since I was too young to get into theaters (the film was rated R). I first thought that the weird stuff in the movie was devised by Lynch, but I discovered it was Gifford and that’s when I started reading his books.” He came here to attend the School of the Art Institute, later graduating from Columbia College with a degree in film. In 1997 he saw “Lost Highway,” the Lynch film also based on the with additional costs to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks, was nearly twice as expensive. “1883,” an Old West origin story for the Dutton family, is filmed mostly in Texas, where the crew re-created 19th century Dallas-Fort Worth. Sheridan Sheridan also is shooting in Montana, an hour outside the nearest town, he said. “My sincere hope is that I deliver,” said Sheridan, who earned an Oscar nomination for writing the contemporary western western “Hell or High Water.” “I do feel that the model Chris is building building is the future. Since I’m the test dummy for it, I hope I survive the crash, so to speak, and deliver something worthy of the gamble.” If the wager works, it could boost subscribers for Paramount+, Paramount+, which needs brandname brandname shows to compete with the likes of Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu and Disney+. ViacomCBS’ efforts have been hobbled by deals such as the one to license “Yellowstone” to Peacock. That deal was signed in September 2019, after Viacom and CBS agreed to merge but before the transaction closed and plans for Paramount+ took shape. It had a similar problem with “South Park,” which is licensed to HBO Max for streaming. To alleviate that issue, McCarthy McCarthy signed “South Park” creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker to a deal for two movies a year through 2027 for Paramount+ Gifford’s work and he began to devour all of the writer’s words. “I was especially floored by his stories set in Chicago,” he told me. “There was such a beautiful power to them, and they were so evocative of a specific time in this city.” He interviewed Gifford for the late and lamented publication publication Chicagoist and when Gifford came to Chicago to participate in a play at Steppenwolf in 2009, he offered to pick the author up at the airport. “In that ride into the city, and while he was here, he asked me to drive to some places he remembered remembered from childhood, and he told stories about that time,” he said. “I was captivated.” That was also when I met Gifford. We were in a one-time event called “Nelson Algren Live: 100th Birthday Celebration at the Steppenwolf Theatre,” part of an onstage gang that also included novelists Russell Banks and Don DeLillo, actors Dafoe and the late that are based on the beloved, foul-mouthed animated show. The “South Park” pact, which includes additional seasons of the Comedy Central staple, is valued at $900 million. “He believes in franchises,” ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish said of McCarthy. “We have some franchises that were, call it ‘encumbered,’ in streaming. But he didn’t say, ‘Screw it. We won’t do anything with those.’ He figured out a path.” The growing audience for “Yellowstone” gave executives confidence. Plus, the series reaches demographics that were underserved by prestigious dramas that are popular in Los Angeles and New York. The show is popular in cities in the South and Midwest, including Dallas, Denver and Kansas City, and over-indexes in smaller counties. While “Mayor of Kingstown” and the upcoming oil-industry drama are not directly related to “Yellowstone,” Sheridan’s shows tend to explore similar themes, which are universal but also relevant relevant to specific regions of the country. Those often include the gentrification of the American West and the failure of institutions, institutions, whether it’s the oil industry, industry, local government or the penal system. “What we’re doing is serving audiences that are really starving starving for content,” McCarthy said. “We are in the business of driving Martha Lavey. Editor/publisher Dan Simon was also in the show; he co-wrote the script with Gifford. It was a fine evening. I “played” Studs Terkel and the highlighted of the show for me was Dafoe’s reading of an Algren short story about a boxer who dies the in ring. Christopher saw that show and later dove into making what would become “Roy’s World.” It took him a relatively short three years to make the movie, financed in part by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council Agency and a lot of individuals. He praises the archival resources at the Chicago Film Archives and the University of Illinois Chicago. He feels “lucky” that Dafoe, Dillon and Taylor (all admirers of Gifford’s work) were receptive to working on the film, “donating their time and gifts,” as Christopher Christopher says. “It was great,” he says. “I flew to New York and taped them in massive commercial hits. We can’t survive on just the coasts.” The franchise’s growth was partly the result of a period of creative productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic for Sheridan. Sheridan. In four months, he said, he turned in a slew of scripts for the overall deal he signed with ViacomCBS in 2020. The company wanted more. “I think they saw an opportunity opportunity to build a bigger world, at the same time people had a lot of time to sort of reassess, and they decided to really double down on Paramount+ and the kind of content I make,” Sheridan said. “And so I talked to Chris about a lot of ambitious ideas, and he bet on them.” McCarthy was sold on the idea of an expanded “Yellowstone”-related “Yellowstone”-related franchise after hearing Sheridan explain his ideas, including the one for “1883,” which he saw as a grandscale grandscale expansion on the world and themes established by the original series. While Sheridan’s work is steeped in classic Western drama, his films and shows complicate the traditional good guy-versusbad guy-versusbad guy narratives of the genre. “This was a conversation he was already having with himself,” McCarthy said. “When you listen to him tell a story, it’s like telling the story of America gone West, the fight for the last frontier.... The question is, how big can we get it?” their apartments, with my little digital recorder and alavaliere microphone. They were so familiar familiar with Barry’s work, so plugged in, it didn’t take long to finish.” Gifford will be back in his hometown this week to see some old friends and watch the movie of his early life. He will be at the Music Box Saturday for a question-and-answer question-and-answer session following following the screening. Christopher too will be there. “Sometimes I just have to pinch myself about this film,” he says. “I have always believed that the best place to start is by not knowing what might happen.... And what has happened here is something very special.” “Roy’s World: Barry Gifford’s Chicago” screens 2:30 p.m. Nov. 13 as part off the Chicago Critics Film Festival at the Music Box Theatre, 3733 N.

But this review isn’t about that show — or “Girls” or “Run the World” or any of the other series that have turned “comedy featuring four single women navigating navigating love and careers in New York City” into a familiar TV trope. The Black women of “Harlem,” a 10-episode streaming comedy that recently premiered on Amazon, are decades younger than — and a few ZIP codes apart from — Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte. But they still eloquently saunter and drunkenly stumble in the stilettoed footsteps of those 20th-century, Cosmopolitan-sipping Cosmopolitan-sipping pioneers. The question is whether adjunct anthropology professor Camille (Meagan Good); successful queer dating app creator Tye (Jerrie Johnson); Johnson); trust fund fashion designer Quinn (Grace Byers); and out-of-work singer-actor Angie (Shoniqua (Shoniqua Shandai) have anything to add to the sisterhood-inthe-city sisterhood-inthe-city playbook. The answer: Absolutely, though the clunky pilot episode of “Harlem” may lead you to believe otherwise. otherwise. The characters at first appear cast from the mold used by HBO more than 20 years ago: Camille is the responsible one who overthinks things, pining after her ex and making bad choices when she secondguesses secondguesses herself.

Each character character grows more interesting interesting as the series proceeds thanks to strong character development and sharp writing, and the chemistry chemistry among the performers performers becomes the bond that carries the show as the women become entangled one another’s relationship relationship disasters and work dilemmas. “Harlem” also tweaks the girls-in-the-city formula by adding a gay character to the inner circle with Tye. It also underscores the limitations of “SATC’s” whitewashed New York: Some of “Harlem’s” most fascinating conversations and scenarios deal with the characters’ varying, and anything but static, ideas Blackness — culturally, personally, comically.

505,2626869703,"Mixed-use development gets OK in Litde Village By Lisa Schencker Chicago Tribune More than 10 years after it was first conceived, a project project to move Saint Anthony Hospital into anew, 30-acre mixed-use development on the city’s Southwest Side is moving forward, after the Chicago City Council approved zoning for the plan Wednesday. The $700 million development, development, to be called the Focal Point Community Campus, is slated to include a new facility for Saint Anthony Hospital, which now sits in a 12 5-year-old building. The hospital would still have about 150 beds. The new development is also expected to feature shopping, a day care facility, facility, a swimming pool, an indoor basketball court, a sports field and space for community and educational programs. “This is going to be an absolute game-changer for the Little Village community community and the Southwest Side of Chicago,” Aid. Michael Rodriguez, 22 nd, said at a news conference following the approval Wednesday. “It will bring education, recreation recreation and business opportunities opportunities to our community.” He noted to the council Wednesday, “We’ve been working on it for a long time.” The site, at West 31st Street and South Kedzie Avenue, formerly was home to Washburne Trade School. It’s about 1.5 miles south of Saint Anthony’s current location. Demolition was slated to begin this week, and will be followed by environmental environmental remediation, said Saint Anthony President and CEO Guy Medaglia. Construction could begin next year, with completion in 2025, he said. The development is expected to be funded by philanthropists and federal and state grants, Medaglia has said.

Saint Anthony plans to lease its new facility from the Chicago Southwest Southwest Development Corp., a nonprofit created to manage the project and headed by Medaglia. The project had a long and winding path to approval Wednesday. Mayor Richard M. Daley first pitched the idea in 2009 to relocate Saint Anthony to the former Washburne site, Medaglia said. At first, Medaglia didn’t think it would be possible. But he talked with the community and ultimately ultimately proposed a mixeduse mixeduse development where rental income from campus tenants would help support the hospital and other community programs. It then, however, took more than 10 years to get to this point — a delay that Medaglia has attributed to “a real horror story about politics and relationships.” Over time, the Chicago Southwest Development Corp. bought the needed land. In April, the Chicago City Council voted to sell the corporation the last piece of land it needed for the development, development, about 11 acres for $5 million. That sale, though approved, has not yet closed. The hospital must be built on the land within six years or the 11 acres will revert to the city. “It’s been the hardest journey I’ve ever taken in my entire career,” Medaglia said at the news conference. “I’m thrilled and in a little disbelief that finally, after all these years, we’ve made it to this point.” As for the current Saint Anthony facility, Medaglia said though the building is too old to continue being a hospital, there’s been interest interest in potentially using it as a senior center. Some community members and groups have opposed the new development, development, worrying that it will lead to gentrification of the area, displacing low-income residents, and saying that they would prefer other uses for the site, such as a vocational vocational school. Medaglia said he hopes to work with the city to keep the potentially higher-property higher-property taxes that could result from gentrification, from driving people out of their homes. “That’s going to be another fight that we’re going to undertake.” Earlier plans for the development had also called for affordable housing, but Medaglia decided to hold off on that for now, so as not to hold up approval from the city’s Department of Planning Planning and Development, he said. Several community leaders leaders spoke in favor of the project at the news conference conference Wednesday. “It’s a symbol of great hope for the future of our neighborhood,” said Andrea Munoz, a longtime Little Village resident. She noted that a number of Little Village residents are undocumented and don’t have health insurance. “Saint Anthony’s has never said ‘no’ to the folks in our neighborhood,” Munoz said. “But I think what’s also important is the project is so much more than just access to health care.... It’s really a very, very comprehensive comprehensive program that will bring much needed resources to the community.” MORE FOR NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIBERS Already getting the Tribune in print?

Disney Original Documentary Documentary and Disney+ said recently that the film, entitled “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road: The Final Elton John Performances and the Years that Made His Legend,” will serve as the definitive and official feature on John’s life and career. Including unseen archival footage, new interviews and a present day look at him and his family, it’ll culminate with his final North American show at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles in November. Oscar-nominated filmmaker R. J. Cutler is directing the film alongside alongside producer and director director David Furnish, who is married to John. No release date was revealed for “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” but the companies teased a festival run and a theatrical release before it streams on Disney+. Speaking of documentaries, documentaries, Lizzo’s getting one too: Lizzo is getting the documentary treatment at HBO Max in an untitled project that “shares the inspirational story behind her humble beginnings to her meteoric rise with an intimate look into the moments that shaped her hard-earned rise to fame, success, love and international international stardom,” the streaming service recently announced. The flute-playing singer, 34, released two albums before her breakout 2019 record “Cuz I Love You,” which earned her eight Grammy nominations at the 2020 ceremony; she won three. “Growing up I never dreamed I’d get to experience experience all of the things I’ve accomplished in my life, and I’m just getting Bad Bunny committed to being total oddball Rapper may be global phenomenon, but Puerto Rico still his battleground, muse By Suzy Exposito Los Angeles Times If you’re young, Latino and slightly prone to melodramatics, melodramatics, you might be the kind of person who stays up for a midnight Bad Bunny album release. In the streaming age, the now-familiar “surprise” Bad Bunny album drop has become an online rite of passage for his global fan base, which seems to grow exponentially with every record. With the May 6 release of “Un Verano Sin Ti,” or “A Summer Without You,” fans took to their phones and computers to communally communally revel in its 23 songs. A procession of Puerto Rican nostalgia, each track is a time capsule stowing memories of epic seaside parties and gone-but-notforgotten gone-but-notforgotten flings, touched with a residual island saudade. “Bad Bunny will have you missing somebody who never existed,” remarked fans on social media, who dressed their timelines with the most noteworthy lyrics and recorded themselves themselves grooving along to their favorite tracks. Even if you don’t personally personally fit the aforementioned character sketch of a Bad Bunny fan, it’s getting harder to circumvent the fanfare that surrounds the 27-year-old singer, online and otherwise. In the days before he dropped “Un Verano,” he was modeling custom Burberry at the Met Gala, dishing with Whoopi Goldberg Goldberg on “The View” and promoting his lead role in the upcoming movie “El Muerto,” in which he will play the first Latino superhero superhero to lead a live-action Marvel film. With every new project, Bad Bunny crashes through another industry ceiling. Released in fall 2020, his previous album, “El Ultimo Elton John performs during the Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour on Jan. 19 in New Orleans. ERIKA GOLDRING/GETTY started. I’m so excited I get to share and relive my journey with my fans and HBO Max,” Lizzo said in a statement. Cole to play basketball in Canada: Rapper J. Cole will play another season of pro basketball, this time in Canada. The Canadian Elite Basketball League tweeted Thursday that the Grammy-winning rapper, 37, will join the Scarborough Scarborough Shooting Stars in the season starting May 25 as a guard. Cole, whose full name is Jermaine Cole, played with the Rwanda Patriots in the Basketball Africa League in 2021.

She died May 13 at age 93 at a nursing nursing home in Morrisville, Vermont, Trapp Family Lodge announced. Rosmarie was the first daughter of Austrian naval Capt. Georg von Trapp and Maria von Trapp, and a younger half-sibling to the older von Trapp children children portrayed onstage and in the movie. When Tour del Mundo,” became the first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart to be completely recorded in Spanish; “Un Verano” recently opened at No. 1. At over 183 million plays, Bad Bunny became Spotify’s Spotify’s most streamed artist ever in a single day following following “Un Verano’s” debut, consequently nabbing the title from his former “Mia” collaborator, rapper Drake. At this point, the only person Bad Bunny has left to compete with is himself. Bad Bunny’s meteoric mainstream success is a feat for any Latino artist, especially a strictly Spanish-language Spanish-language one, not to mention a San Juan grocery bagger turned world-famous rapper, gifted with the foresight to reject numerous major label offers and do his own thing on his own time. (Bad Bunny releases music under the banner of independent independent label Rimas, now distributed by Sony Music.) But while mile markers like “first Latino to...” are significant, what’s most impressive is that Bad Bunny remains committed committed to being a total oddball. Unlike his Puerto Rican predecessors Daddy Yankee or Don Omar, Bad Bunny doesn’t sing about just wooing the ladies but about empowering them. He has dressed in drag and wrestled in the WWE; in his latest music video for “Un Verano” opener “Moscow Mule,” he assumes the form of a sexless Ken doll, leaping leaping across the sea like a dolphin. With “Un Verano,” Bad Bunny earns these zany artistic indulgences. He has worked hard for his place at the top, not just as a trap or reggaeton star, or even a Latino star, but as an auteur in popular music.

It feels like life is starting starting to return to a sense of normalcy as the pandemic recedes, and my friends and I are socializing more outside of our homes — going out dancing, and enjoying the nightlife. My best friend and I are not big drinkers, and every time we go out men pressure pressure us to drink and then try to shame us for not “knowing how to party.” Can you help us come up with a witty comeback to shut down the pressure to drink? — Happy Teetotaler Dear Happy: Alcohol is the only drug I can think of where people are continuously continuously asked to explain why they are not using it. Understand, however, that you are a part of a growing community of people who are choosing to live sober. Much as I enjoy offering snappy comebacks, I think the most important thing for you to do is to own your sobriety. The only good thing about being shamed for “not knowing how to party” is that it offers you a very quick insight into the people who do this (women also pressure people to drink). People who pressure you to party are throwing down red flags, and you should take this as your cue to avoid them. You’re starting to venture out now for your first time as a legal adult, and so you should take some basics to heart: Never accept a drink from anyone other than directly from your trusted companion or Tainy, MAG and La Paciencia, Paciencia, he realizes futureforward futureforward sounds for his peers and fans to take in.

Your professional bartender is your friend here. State that you aren’t drinking alcohol and ask for a good substitute. A seasoned bartender will give you alternatives and also take this as a cue to keep an eye on you. If you ever feel threatened, let the bartender and/or club security know. (No matter what you’re drinking, tip the bar staff well.) Regarding explaining your sobriety, it would be easy for you to lie: ■ “I’m celebrating ‘Dry July.’” ■ “I’m running a marathon tomorrow.” ■ “Shhhhhh — I’m pregnant.” ■ “One more DUI, and I’m in the slammer.” But owning your sobriety sobriety looks something like this: “I don’t drink because I don’t want to. Thank you for respecting my choice.” Dear Amy: My sister retired recently and moved away from her family and to the Southwest. She purchased a small home in a 55-and-older community and seems very happy. She stated that it was the only place she found that she could afford, relying solely on her Social Security and some savings. Thirty years ago, she divorced and apparently in the divorce decree her husband was ordered to invest a sum of money, on her behalf, to be given to her when her ex-husband retired. Her ex has been retired now for over five years, and her ex and her kids are reluctant to give her the money because they are afraid she will just spend it. Drake; we also get to know “Andrea,” a composite of strong-minded Latinas, who just want to party in La Perla until 4 a.m. without without being harmed. (This haunting pop vignette spotlights the silken voice of Raquel Berrios, vocalist of Puerto Rican dance-pop act Buscabulla.) Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rico I really believe she has forgotten about this nest egg over the years. She could really use the money, and if she spends it and enjoys herself, good for her. Should I bring this up to her, or should I leave it alone and let her family decide when the time is right to give her what’s overdue? — Wondering Sibling Dear Sibling: I’m wondering wondering how you and her kids know about your sister’s nest egg when she doesn’t, but yes — I think you should bring this up. I agree with you that if your sister has money coming to her, then she should receive it. A divorce decree isn’t a suggestion — it’s a legal agreement. Dear Amy: Thank you for honing in on the sexism implied by “Upset Grandma” who claimed to be “confused” by the “paternalism” demonstrated demonstrated by a family naming a son after other male family members. People should have the right to honor previous generations by naming children after them. Male or female: Who cares!? — Grateful Reader Dear Grateful: My sense is that “Upset Grandma” was hoping to prod me into a feminist rant regarding male children being named after male ancestors. But she caught me with my rants down. Copyright 2022 by Amy Dickinson Distributed by Tribune Content Agency is at once muse and political political battleground. It’s largely thanks to a global commercial commercial interest in the island’s musical output, namely reggaeton, that Bad Bunny was able to launch his career in the first place; as a result, many a mainstream pop heartthrob has been rebranded in the image of Bunny and other Caribbean Caribbean artists, furthering the gentrification of their sounds. In what feels like a course correction, “Un Verano” presents reggaeton reggaeton as what it is when it’s not mediated by market forces: a timeless heritage sound, in the same league as Caribbean party staples like merengue, salsa and mambo. Such tensions also fuel “El Apagon,” or “The Blackout.” Blackout.” Written amid rolling blackouts across the island — a byproduct of its power grid being transferred to a private company, the latest setback to Puerto Rico’s recovery after Hurricane Maria — the song is the zenith of “Un Verano Sin Ti,” a patriotic scorcher of a club track that comes as a warning shot to all those looking to cash in on a vulnerable Puerto Rico. Even as it’s become a chic music industry destination, the material reality of its locals grows more stark in contrast. These are not just the artist’s rallying cries to defend his homeland or his sound; now, at a critical moment in his career, when both the American music industry and Hollywood are fighting for a piece of Bad Bunny, he has his identity identity to fight for too. Still, as is usually the case in a Bad Bunny song, it does not stop anyone from dancing dancing through the darkness.

She also talked about public safety measures for the upcoming Halloween weekend. CHRIS SWEDA/CHICAGO TRIBUNE Real fear is edging out the make-believe kind this Halloween Laura Washington The big day is upon us, and America’s America’s dress-up scare fest is back in full swing. This year, celebrants are shrugging off the ebbing pandemic and defying defying wallet-sucking inflation to spend big on jack-o’-lanterns, costumes and candy. This year’s Halloween spending season is expected to hit a record high of $10.6 billion, compared with $10.1 billion in 2021, according to an annual survey conducted for the National Retail Federation. “Participation in Halloween-related activities will resume to pre-pandemic levels, with 69% of consumers planning planning to celebrate the holiday this year, up from 65% in 2021 and comparable to 68% in 2019,” the retail group stated in a news release. Halloween arrives shortly before national and local elections, when voters have politicians on their minds, for better or worse. In 2016, horror-inspiring latex visages of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were outselling the renderings of VOICE OF THE PEOPLE Threat of gentrification I am writing about the fear my lifelong neighbors and I have with the gentrification of the Belmont Cragin neighborhood. neighborhood. Early this year, the Tribune published the article “Fighting to stay” (June 5), which discusses how rises in rent and property taxes are displacing Latino residents. Belmont Cragin is a neighborhood where many people displaced by gentrification have moved. This is amazing as it keeps the predominantly Hispanic and African American American culture alive. However, now we are seeing that rising rents are causing causing those who were once able to afford to live here to be displaced. Homeowners are being affected as well. Those who have been living in this neighborhood for decades are selling their homes because of rising property taxes. There also has been a rise in new developments due to building owners selling to luxury apartment developers. My fellow community members cannot afford to live here anymore — renters and homeowners! I believe that my community could benefit from something something like the Pilsen Housing Cooperative, “the neighborhood’s neighborhood’s first and only limited-equity, scattered-site housing cooperative for longtime residents of Pilsen,” as Laura Rodriguez Presa writes in her article. This co-op helped challenge gentrification in Pilsen and gave renters an opportunity to be shareholders of an apartment complex while being able to provide others reasonable rent rates. I think it is time for Belmont Cragin to do the same to combat gentrification in our community. This would prevent displacement and give people in our community the opportunity to become homeowners. — Dayana Salgado, student, Northeastern Illinois University, University, Chicago Failures of Biden administration U.S. Border Patrol recently released data reporting that authorities made nearly 2.4 million arrests of migrants Freddy Krueger’s mangled face.

There were 227,000 illegal migrants arrested in September alone, an 11% increase compared to August and the third-highest number recorded this year along the US.-Mexico border. Migrant arrests or encounters this fiscal year were 37% higher than the previous fiscal year and more than two times the total recorded in 2019. About 458,000 migrant encounters were recorded in 2020, the report said, but the onset of the pandemic likely enhanced that number. This exposes the Biden administration’s appalling failure failure to protect our southern border, despite claims to the contrary by Vice President Kamala Harris, who carries the water for the administration on this burning issue. This, added to other serious negative outcomes since January 2021 in economic matters — record-setting inflation, inflation, massive deficit spending — and foreign affairs — the shamefully managed evacuation from Afghanistan and lack of serious measures to deal with heightened human rights violations by China — reflect floundering and often amateurish approaches to carrying out the nation’s role as leader of the free world. It’s more than time to call a halt to the “Keystone Kops do government” methods used by President Joe Biden and his minions in the executive and legislative branches. — WT. Rowan, Park Ridge Republican voter’s imperative Even though I am a lifelong Republican, I refuse to vote for any Republican candidate who claims that Donald Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election. I would rather vote for a Democrat or a write-in candidate than a Republican who promotes the idea that Trump won in 2020, a fiction so preposterous that it has been rejected even by judges appointed by Trump and Trump’s own attorney general. Contrary to what some media outlets claim, there is no evidence that Trump lost because of voting fraud. As cratic institutions, political candidates, party offices, election events and election workers will likely increase” as the midterms approach, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned in a bulletin issued earlier this year. Americans are running away screaming from the rants and lies that have hijacked civil discourse on social media, on both sides of the political aisle. We are disgusted by the incessant TV ads pitching images of murderous street violence and accusing accusing political candidates of everything from supporting child molesters to massacring fetuses. Meanwhile, gun violence has left our cities petrified. Halloween revelry is a luxury many who live in urban areas cannot afford. In my childhood, it was safe to run up and down the block, trick-or-treating trick-or-treating door to door in my neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side. Today, there are no treats, only deathly tricks for our kids. They are being shot, maimed and killed on a regular basis, just for trying to stay alive. Akeem Briscoe, 7, will not be here for the Halloween fun. Akeem was shot to death Wednesday night at his home in Humboldt Park on Chicago’s West Side. He was in the bathroom of his home, washing his hands and getting ready for bed. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt note in the book “How Democracies Die,” unjustifiably undermining confidence in the fairness of elections can be harmful, even fatal, to democracies. The fate of our republic is more important than my party winning the next round of elections. It is time for us Republicans to put this false and dangerous idea behind us. — Paul Bialek, Deerfield Postmark date for ballots I’m old enough to remember when people filed their tax returns by snail mail. There was always a last-minute rush at the post office to get returns postmarked by the April 15 deadline day. If the postmark date was good enough for the Internal Revenue Service, then a ballot postmarked by Election Day should be good enough for election officials. — DavidFanta, Oak Park Referendum coverage I personally want to thank the Tribune for the very specific outline of what to expect on the ballots for this Election Day. I was aware of some of the referendums that will appear on the ballot, but I thought that the Tribune did a superb job in spelling it all out in great detail. I’ve been a subscriber and reader of the Tribune for many years; however, I do not recall ever seeing in prior years the detail that the Tribune folks went to this year. I tore out those sheets, and I will continue to study them right up until I cast my vote. — RichardHahn, Chicago For online-exclusive letters, go to www.chicagotribune. com/letters.

Police said a family member told them the boy was in the bathroom when a bullet pierced the window and struck him, according to ABC-7 Chicago. The second grader was shot in front of his mother and two siblings. The same night, a 15-year-old was shot to death on the South Side. This Halloween, real-life fear takes center stage. In the wake of Akeem’s death, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and police Superintendent David Brown called a news conference Thursday to brief reporters on the precautions the city is taking to keep Halloween revelers revelers safe — and alive. “These two boys should have been in school today, anxiously awaiting a weekend of fun,” Lightfoot said at the news conference. “They should have gone on celebrating every year afterward. afterward. Instead, today, two families have been ripped apart. Tragic loss that the families are dealing with, and a city, once again, is mourning the loss of two of our precious young people.” Already this year, 298 children have been shot, 41 fatally, in Chicago, according to data analyzed by ABC-7 Chicago.
