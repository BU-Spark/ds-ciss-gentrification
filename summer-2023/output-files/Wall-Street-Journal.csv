The appeal of Chinatown to an array of residents represents a reversal reversal in the perception of these communities. Chinese immigrants, who first began arriving on the West Coast in the 1840s, were viewed with hostility by the white majority, and the enmity only increased increased in the ensuing decades, says Ellen Wu, an associate professor professor of history at Indiana University University Bloomington. Immigrants created created the first Chinatown in San Francisco around 1850 and soon began forming others, as they were increasingly rejected and restricted restricted from other neighborhoods, Ms. Wu says. Chinatowns that were built in the late 19th century or early 20th century were usually usually on the outskirts of cities where land was relatively inexpensive. But today, cities including Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Boston have grown to the point that their Chinatowns sit within the urban core, making the land more valuable valuable and more coveted. Plus, many potential residents of high-end developments developments increasingly see Chinatowns Chinatowns as having a unique charm and authenticity.

TRAVEL The Promised Island Overshadowed by glitzy Capri, the Italian island of Ischia is a defiantly scruffy, stuck-in-time alternative that delivers so much more BY TARA ISABELLA BURTON I TOLD THE BUS driver that I knew the island. I told him that I’d spent my childhood summers here on Ischia, this volcanic island of 60,000 off the coast of Naples, and that I didn?t need directions. That was an hour ago, when I first boarded the bus at the island’s main port. Now I was stranded on a beach with my suitcase, my high heels sinking into the sand. The pastel cliff-side houses of Sant?Angelo—the Sant?Angelo—the fishing village that was my destination—glittered across the small bay. I’d taken the wrong bus. I’d experienced Sant’Angelo (population about 1,000) mostly as a child. My mother, an expat living in Rome, had come here every summer for 20 years before I was bom, and she brought me back almost every July until my teens.

But as stood on Maronti Beach, after my bus misadventure, I wondered how well I really knew the island. Years earlier, I could have walked along the beach to Sant’Angelo, but since I was last here, the Tyrrhenian Sea had eroded the narrow shoreline. Perhaps the town had changed too. I imagined a piazza full of impossibly impossibly stylish cocktail bars, restaurants restaurants I could no longer afford. (After (After all, Angela Merkel had started summering here.) But, I soon came to learn, change comes slowly to Ischia. This rugged, mountainous island has escaped escaped the relentless gentrification of nearby Capri. Its southern coast feels especially removed from the forward march of the rest of the world. Lizards still seem to outnumber outnumber houses.

The town remembered me, too. A lifeguard, taking pity on me, hailed a water-taxi ($3) so I could cross the bay, crystalline and virtually virtually empty, even now, in June. The boat stopped a few feet from the beach. One of the sailors hopped out and, thigh-deep in water, lifted me straight up—as I clutched my laptop bag—above the waves. At Sant’Angelo’s Fumarole Beach, where hot springs heat the silver sands, a grey-bearded, sun-withered man called Davide, who had been selling pareos and jewelry along the water since before I could walk, recognized recognized me and called over one of the electric carts to take me to my hotel. I had booked a few nights at the hillside Casa Garibaldi, where, as soon as I arrived, the proprietress proprietress Luisa Iacano, and her mother, Giuseppina, well into her 80s, embraced embraced me. A new house dog had replaced the one I remembered. Their wireless internet only worked in a single comer of the sea-facing, mosaic-tiled terrace; the rooms had no phone signal. None of the many regular visitors seemed to mind. Sant’Angelo’s sense of traditionalism. traditionalism. I found, bordered on the ferocious. ferocious.

A vast network of relatives served as the wait staff, ferrying fresh clams and squidseasoned squidseasoned with the particularly piquant peperoncino that distinguishes distinguishes the island’s cuisine—from the kitchen to the seaside tables. Emanuela still insists on regularly taste-testing the mixed seafood pasta dish that bears her name. The mud baths at Terme Cavascura thermal spa, one of the island’s biggest biggest attractions, are still inaccessible inaccessible by car. The spa, a plaster shack nestled into a rock wall, overlooks a grotto of natural hot-springs in use since the days of Ancient Rome. For between $13 and $30. depending on the spa package, visitors can get a private thermal-clay mud bath and visit the naturally heated showers, pools and sauna. On days when the bay is too rough for a water-taxi, visitors must take the vertiginous, barely paved footpath to reach the spa. But the journey has its own rewards: rewards: It wends past Tavema Pietro Paolo detto Stalino, built into the cliffs. In operation since the late 19th century, it serves simple pasta dishes for as little as $6 a plate. Meals run a little pricier at the restaurants in Sant’Angelo’s piazzetta, piazzetta, which faces the sea, where places like II Peppino and n Fescatore Fescatore are as spendy as those you’d find in Capri. But the mood all around the piazzetta is relaxed and Lizards outnumber houses. Wine still goes for $4 a carafe. buoyant. I sensed a spirit of joyful anarchy at odds with the sizable yachts docked in the bay: Unattended Unattended children eating gelato on the rocks, teenagers drinking Peronis Peronis on the pier, diving every so often often into the warm, turquoise sea.

I drank an inexplicably delicious delicious admixture of prosecco and port and nibbled on the olives, white bean salad and other snacks that came my way at irregular intervals, intervals, listening to lilting Italian covers of ’80s pop hits.

He’d been coming every summer, summer, he said; first with his parents, then with his girlfriend. The other children I’d played with—all grown now—were heading over in a few weeks: The caretaker of slender Petrelle Beach would soon be reserving reserving sunbeds for them. On my last day in Ischia, I hiked from Sant’Angelo into the hill town of Serrara, where the old women gather at the 19th-century churches for vespers on Saturday nights. Then I continued on to the top of Monte Epomeo, the island’s highest peak, at 2,588 feet. Tufa rock and dry brush gave way to honeysuckle and wisteria, bird of paradise and yellow ginestra, then to thick forests. forests. Field mice replaced the lizards. Vineyards, growing on the slopes, were each “gated? by a repurposed bedframe—an Ischian custom. As I prepared to make the final ascent, I stopped for water at a treehouse-style cafe near a sacred grotto. One of the patrons, a jovial man named Nicola—holding court at the bar counter to the amusement amusement of the silent proprietress— informed me that my face was red “as a Ferrari.? He followed up by offering me various items of the same color: a rose, a plate of bruschetta, bruschetta, an armful of fresh cherries cherries he’d picked himself.

I remember the electric thrill of that crackling, compressed signal. It was illicit outside the home too; in the late 1970, pirates still roved the airwaves airwaves of Europe. As Tim Mohr’s original original and inspiring “Burning Down the Haus” shows, music could make all the difference in the world. In September 1977, while I was secretly listening to Radio Luxembourg Luxembourg in London, Britta Bergmann was listening even more secretly in East Berlin. The Luxembourg transmitter transmitter was powerful enough to reach nearly everywhere in communist East Germany. Ms. Bergmann had seen the Sex Pistols in a music magazine magazine smuggled from West Berlin. When she heard “Pretty Vacant” on Radio Luxembourg, she hacked off her hair, tore her clothes, affixed two rows of safety pins (“punk-rock epaulets”) to her shoulders, and went to school. “Hello, Major!” said a fellow pupil. “Major” was probably the first East German punk. In May 1978 the police summoned her for questioning. Three months later, the Stasi opened a file on her “negative-decadent” tastes. While English punks like the Clash complained about record-company contracts, Major waged a one-woman campaign against a police state. As in Nazi Germany, work was compulsory under communism. Major dropped off the radar, shaking off the Stasi by moving from apartment to apartment. In summer 1979, she discovered she was not alone. By late 1980 a small group of Ostpunks Ostpunks were meeting at a youth club in a Berlin park called Planterwald. Micha Horschig had also heard the Sex Pistols under the covers, from a samizdat samizdat cassette. After that, he discovered the forbidden theories of 19th-century anarchists like Bakunin, Proudhon, and Stirner in “an old set of pre-War encyclopedias.” encyclopedias.” He became “A-Micha,” Anarchy Micha. “I’ve got to go over the Wall,” Johnny Rotten had sung in the Sex Pistols’ “Holidays in the Sun” (1977). “I don’t understand this bit at all.” Pachyderm Parties & a Hue That’ll Make You Cry CHILDREN'S BOOKS Meghan C ox Gurdon A seemingly simple picture book about the color blue deepens into something something more: a reverie on youth, life, aging and loss. THERE'S NO NEED to make things complicated in a picture book for the youngest readers. What’s wanted is a bit of visual interest and a bit of narrative that will capture the attention of babies and toddlers without overwhelming them. But blandness is no good either; there has to be some fun, some color, some little hook to keep the interest. Kevin Henkes has demonstrated a knack for getting it right with illustrated books such as “Waiting” (2015) and “Egg” (2017), and he shows it again with “A Parade of Elephants” (Greenwillow, 40 pages, $18.99), a simple book done up in macaron shades of raspberry, blueberry, lemon, cassis and pistachio. “Look! Elephants!” the first page announces, and that’s about as prolix as it gets. From there, the reader—ideally helped by a grown-up—will count elephants on a kind of graph that shows the difference between numbers one to five and then follow the animals as they commence marching in a jolly parade. “Big and round and round they are. Big and round and round they go,” we read, as elephants rendered in single colors and thick lines traipse in a circle. As they march, the text introduces children ages 1-3 to spatial concepts such as over and under, in and out, and up and down: It’s clear, clean and cheerful. Laura Vaccaro Seeger slips a considerable degree more complexity into the outwardly simple pages of “Blue” (Roaring Brook, 38 pages, $17.99), a picture book for children who are a step older, NO PLAN 'Ostpunks' at a concert on the grounds of a church in East Berlin, 1982. Western punks used pseudonyms so they could continue claiming unemployment unemployment benefits—even while they were playing shows and, as the Clash said, “turning rebellion into money.” The early Ostpunks (including Fatzo, Buzzcock, Colonel, Pankow) used pseudonyms to avoid spies, 48hour 48hour interrogations and beatings by the police. Punks in the West may have complained complained about conformism, but in East Germany tastes really were imposed from the top down. After November 1965, East Germany had an official youth culture. Dancing was permitted as a “legitimate expression of the joy of life” in Free German Youth, the cadres cadres of communist volunteers whose ranks included a young Angela Merkel. But Beatle haircuts were banned and even amateur bands had to submit to a state audition for an Einstufung, or “classification” license. By 1971, the regime, having relaxed its follicular tyranny, was promoting third-rate acid rock bands through its “youth radio” station and state record label, and allowing churches to hold ersatz rock shows called Blues Masses. As in technology theft, the communists were imitating the West in order to survive. The first Ostpunk band, formed in 1980, began as AFS, for Antifaschistischer Antifaschistischer Schutzwall—the “Antifascist Protection Wall,” as the dictatorship ages 3-7. An exploration of the many shades of a single color, “Blue” is also an emotional tour de force that sneaks up on the reader and, when it’s over, all but demands to be read again straightaway. There’s a clue to the book’s duality on the front cover: What first appear to be random splotches of thick blue paint represent, in fact, a paw print. The paw belongs to a golden retriever puppy named Blue who belongs to a little boy (see right), and as the pages turn, and we encounter one type of blue after another (“baby blue,” “sky blue,” “midnight blue”), the boy and the dog get older. They frisk with balls and balloons and in the surf; they play tug-of-war and go camping. As in her previous color story, 2012’s “Green,” Ms. Seeger uses cut-outs in the pages to artful effect, giving glimpses of what has passed and what is to come. For many readers, what is to come will be full-out sobs as eventually “old blue” lies without interest beside a full bowl of food—he’s not eating anymore—and then, on the next page, rests cradled and dying in the arms of the boy. Oh, we are blue! Yet death is not the end, for “new blue” and new love come to leaven the final pages of this tender story. While we have the tissues out, it’s probably a safe time to consider Jonathan Auxier’s “Sweep” (Amulet, 344 pages, called the Berlin Wall. The name was soon changed to Planlos: “No Plan,” a repudiation of five-year plans and the communist future. Ostpunk was crude and derivative, but the Ostpunks were doing more than aping Western poses. In one of Planlos’s first songs, “Waiting in Line at the Currywurst Stand,” lyricist Micha Kobs describes being spied on by the Stasi’s Department Department XX—responsible, Mr. Mohr notes, for “subverting underground political activity”: I don’t turn around—I’ve already seen you You are my shadow wherever I go A dark spot on the sun If I think too loud, you are there. In March 1981, Planlos made a semi-public debut at a party at the Yugoslavian Embassy in East Berlin. By now, Mr. Mohr writes, an “informal national network was starting to take shape”: Virus X in Rostock, Wutanfall in Leipzig, Rotzjungen in Dresden. With the Solidarity movement stirring in neighboring Poland, the authorities cracked down. Major was imprisoned for asoziales Verhalten, the crime of not working. The Stasi and the Kl, the political division of the police, drove punks off the streets and out of sight. The East Berlin punks retreated to a church where a sympathetic pastor, Uwe Kulisch, allowed them to play muTHIS muTHIS WEEK A Parade of Elephants By Kevin Henkes Blue By Laura Vaccaro Seeger Sweep By Jonathan Auxier Pride By Ibi Zoboi $18.99), a novel set in Victorian times with the subtitle “The Story of a Girl and Her Monster.” The book could as easily be described as the tale of a girl and her protectors, for the monster in this case is no horrible grotesque but a sweethim sweethim an outlier in the hard, cruel London of the late 1870s. Eleven-year-old Nan works with a gang of other kids her age, and younger, as a chimney chimney sweep for a moneygrubbing moneygrubbing sadist named Wilkie natured creature, a golem, formed for the purpose of defending Nan Sparrow when her human guardian no longer can. Charlie, as Nan calls the golem, is made of soot, but he might as well be made of pure love. Indeed, there is a purity and innocence in the golem—keep the tissues handy—that, quite apart from his unorthodox composition, make sic and party at “Open Work” youth evenings. By late 1981 “more than a hundred punks would turn up every Monday or Friday night.” The Stasi opened a file on Open Work: In spring 1982, following at least “twenty-five visits by informants,” Kulisch found his church closed for “renovations.” In January 1989 a government report named punk as ‘the top problem’ in managing the youth of East Germany. By August 1982 the Stasi estimated that East Germany (population about 15 million) contained 1,000 punk “adherents” “adherents” and another 10,000 “sympathizers” “sympathizers” recognizable “by their appearance.” A compilation album, “Live in Paradise DDR,” had been smuggled out and issued in the West.

Quick-witted and hardworking, hardworking, Nan attracts the philanthropic interest of a young Jewish teacher, but when disaster strikes—it’s a terrifying incident that nearly kills the girl and awakens the golem— she earns the burning hatred of Crudd and the meanest boy in the gang. Mr. Auxier has drawn from history, mythology, and a deep well of personal love and suffering to create a stirring work of magical realism for readers ages 8 to 12. “It’s a truth universally acknowledged that when rich people move into the hood, where it’s a little bit broken and a little bit forgotten, the first thing they want to do is clean it up.” So begins Ibi Zoboi’s “Pride” (Balzer + Bray, 289 pages, $17.99), a teen love story set in modern Brooklyn that borrows its first sentence and other narrative elements from Jane Austen’s Regency-era romance “Pride and Prejudice.” Pride in this story comes in the form of Zuri Benitez, a feisty young woman who is intensely proud of her Afro-Caribbean ment for weeks. Lyrics were hidden or memorized, because some band members members had become snitches. Major was imprisoned again, then expelled to the West. A-Micha spent six months in pre-trial detention, with daily interrogations. interrogations. Planlos’s Micha Kobs was drafted into the army. Despite the crackdown, Ostpunk continued to grow. A band called Feeling Feeling B played the game, won an Einstufung Einstufung permit and hit the road, their audiences prepared by what Mr. Mohr calls a “shadow media” of illegal recordings recordings on tape. By 1988, the author estimates, “three quarters of all music released in the DDR originated outside the state-controlled media system.” The punks, now organizing themselves themselves into anarcho-syndicalist committees, committees, had built their own society—a living, loud reproach to the communist system. In January 1989, around the time that the Polish regime began negotiating with Solidarity, an East German government report identified punk as “the top problem” in managing East Germany’s youth and concluded that expelling the “old classic punks” had only increased contact between West and East. The collapse of the regime in November of that year led to a brief dream of real anarchy, an Indian summer of squatting and life by committee. committee. “We didn’t stay in the noncapitalist noncapitalist world through the long, bitter years of the dictatorship just to sit by passively and watch the breaking breaking up and selling off of our country,” a squatting group announced in 1989. Then the democratic authorities asserted asserted control, and the developers moved in. The bands died, though not, Mr. Mohr insists, “the spirit of East Berlin punk rock.” I must admit I like reading about Ostpunk better than listening to it. Yet ‘'Burning Down the Haus” is more than an exciting yam. Mr. Mohr has written an important work of Cold War cultural cultural history, and his first-hand interviews interviews are invaluable evidence. Inspired by the products of a capitalist music industry, the Ostpunks created a replica, replica, a musical Trabant. But their music was more than a revolution in the head, and their heroism cannot be erased by the reunification of Germany or the gentrification of Berlin. Ostpunk remains a testament to the urge for freedom and the potency of cheap music. music.

Zuri also embodies prejudice, which she reveals in her instant dislike of the wealthy, newly arrived Darcy family— particularly handsome, haughty Darius—and in her animus toward the white newcomers who are altering her neighborhood’s racial complexion. As with Austen’s heroine, the girl will find that her first impressions of Darius, his brother Ainsley and their charming friend Warren are not a reliable guide to each young man’s true character. Unlike Austen, Ms. Zoboi doesn’t write here with literary formality or what has been called classical narrative tact. For her characters, a bad attitude is “stank,” a rich family is “bougie as hell,” and an instant attraction is a “you-look-so-damn-goodthat-my-eyes-are-eating-your “you-look-so-damn-goodthat-my-eyes-are-eating-your face thing.” Her heavy use of slang will undoubtedly amuse and validate those readers ages 13-17 who use it themselves, but it may otherwise limit the book’s appeal.",9/22/2018,"('germany', 'or', 'the')","('berlin', 'ostpunk', 'remains')","[' But their music was more than a revolution in the head, and their heroism cannot be erased by the reunification of Germany or the gentrification of Berlin.']", But their music was more than a revolution in the head and their heroism cannot be erased by the reunification of Germany or the gentrification of Berlin

But in working-class communities in or near Washington, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco—where employment is relatively strong and housing costs are high—big investors have become an active part of the housing market. Virginia Tech professor Derek Hyra, who is writing a book about the gentrification of Washington?s historically black, largely low-income Shaw/U Street neighborhood, said while the gentrification process has been moving slowly for decades, it sped up in late 2009 and early 2010, due partially to rising foreclosures. foreclosures. ?You see doggy daycares daycares popping up in the U Street area, which is sort of unbelievable,” unbelievable,” Mr. Hyra said.

The 39-year-old musician and youth soccer coach purchased his home in West Oakland for $302,000 in 2004, when the neighborhood was, as he said, ?very marginal.” The housing crash made things worse.

It reunites reunites the six scenes of the loves, whims and vengeance vengeance of the gods—derived gods—derived from Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” “Metamorphoses,” enacted by glorious, newly cleaned “Rape of Europa” (1559-62), the terrified terrified heroine precariously sprawled on the back of Zeus, who is disguised as a white bull. Its radiant color, bravura gestures and delicate depiction depiction are hallmarks of Titian’s vigorous late style. It has been 400 years since the now widely dispersed masterworks were last together. We won’t soon see them that way again. Equally impressive was “The Medici: Portraits and Politics, 1512 - 1570 ” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, which surveyed the years when the Medici were dukes of Florence. Florence. The focus, according to the wall text, was on how Medici Medici rulers used portraiture “to project power, assert the continuity continuity of the dynasty, and convey convey cultural refinement.” A dazzling assembly of paintings by Pontormo, Rosso Fiorentino, Bronzino, Raphael and Titian, Titian s 'Danae (1551-53), above; Dawoud Bey s 'Martina and Rhonda' (1993), below center; Chaim Soutine's 'Woman in Pink' (c. 1924), bottom left plus significant sculptures by Cellini, and more, brought the era to vivid life. As we entered, Cellini’s monumental bronze bust of Cosimo I as a Roman emperor stared us down. A brief prologue prologue reprised the sober values values of the Florentine Republic, followed by a wealth of icy, meticulously detailed portraits portraits of Cosimo’s family, and political, military, literary and artistic figures and other notables, notables, shown rigidly erect, necks and fingers impossibly elongated. Signs of status, rendered with fanatical care in glorious color, dominated. Cosimo, in armor, and his wife, Eleonora di Toledo, and their children, sumptuously dressed, embodied power and importance. Most weird? Bronzino’s image of Giovanni de’ Medici as St. John the Baptist, nude except for a strategic blue drape, artfully fitted into the rectangle of the canvas. Most memorable? Bronzino’s profile portrait of the poet Laura Battiferri, presented presented as a female Dante, with a book and an unimaginably delicate, transparent veil. “Cezanne Drawing,” at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, allowed us to watch as the artist slowly educated his hand and his eye, internalizing internalizing works from the past, experimenting experimenting with new impulses, impulses, and transforming the concept of the work of art as a report on actuality into a powerful evocation of individual individual perception and response. Cezanne drew constantly, recording recording works in the Louvre, his family, landscape, his own face, and household furnishings. furnishings. We discovered how he tested ideas for compositions and probed the components of future canvases, how he used drawing as a visible equivalent equivalent of emotion—“sensation,” he called it—and always as an impassioned search. We became became attuned to Cezanne’s single-mindedness and his evolving obsessions, from turbocharged turbocharged youthful narratives to late flickering watercolor landscapes and still lifes notable notable for their contradictory sense of fragility and weight. It was exhilarating. “Soutine / De Kooning: Conversations in Paint,” at the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, was inevitably not a dialogue. While De Kooning expressed his admiration for Soutine’s work, Soutine was unaware of the Dutch-born painter’s efforts, unaware even of his existence. Yet a strong selection of works emphasized emphasized the artists’ commonalities, commonalities, especially their passion passion for the physicality of oil paint. “Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented,” De Kooning Kooning is supposed to have said. For Soutine, that flesh was often often that of a butchered animal, animal, treated as sensually as the voluptuous bodies of De Kooning’s grinning Women. The show documented and sometimes illustrated De Kooning’s encounters with Soutine’s canvases, revealing how they resonated with him, so that we found new affinities affinities between De Kooning’s light-struck “landscapes” and Soutine’s blood-drenched beef and near-iridescent decaying poultry. In the end, we savored savored both painters’ work as vigorous disquisitions on the history of their own making and as embodiments of their authors’ desire for what Clement Greenberg called, in Soutine, “unimpeded expression expression of feeling.” The elegant, mostly blackand-white blackand-white photographs in “Dawoud “Dawoud Bey: An American Project,” Project,” at New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art, could be described as contemporary contemporary versions of the Medici portraits. Mr. Bey’s stated intent intent is to “amplify” parts of American society not usually celebrated—the Black community, community, teenagers—whom he treats with the respect accorded accorded the Florentine dukes by their court painters. Mr. Bey’s early images of Harlem, made in the mid-1970s, sometimes capture capture the unexpected, but in most (as in the work of August Sander and Diane Arbus, whom he clearly admires) his subjects are aware of being seen and gaze steadily at the viewer. Mr. Bey’s sitters are solemn, still, immensely dignified, and revealed revealed as beautiful. The retrospective, retrospective, spanning more than four decades, included the compelling compelling paired images of young and old, from Mr. Bey’s “Birmingham “Birmingham Project,” as well as more recent, moody views of Underground Railroad sites, imagined, Mr. Bey says, as seen The Frick took over the Breuer building, while Cezanne’s drawings overran MoMA. by a fugitive slave. Color images documenting the gentrification of Harlem were a recent iteration iteration of his long connection with the community. But the most unignorable, poetic works were Mr. Bey’s portraits. They insist that attention must be paid. The concurrent “Jasper Johns: Mind/Mirror” exhibitions exhibitions at the Whitney Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art may be the year’s most ambitious projects, each a complete complete retrospective with a different different emphasis. We learn a lot about the constants and variables variables in Mr. Johns’s development development and his explorations of different conceptions and materials. materials. We are led from the early Flag, Target, Number and Letter Letter paintings, with their banal images and lush surfaces, to the weirdly allusive but fairly impenetrable recent works.

It took almost that long to build both the wine shop and restaurant a feat that Mr. Coll said he wouldn’t advise anyone to repeat. “It’s hard enough to open one business in New York, let alone two,? he said with a laugh. The idea behind opening both places together was to offer restaurant patrons the opportunity to buy the wine that they fell in love with at the restaurant at the store next door. The wine list would mirror the offerings at the store although the two aren’t exactly identical right now. Only about half the wine on the list are on the store shelves. It’s hard to keep wines in stock in both places, said Mr. Coll. This was especially true when most of the wines that he features are limited-production limited-production wines from small producers. And there was the financial matter. “You need a lot of money to keep up,” said Mr. Coll Many of his wines are hard to find elsewhere in New York, Mr. Coll said as ment or free* food; others will acce?pt meals but not money; others will only post for a fee.

Part of the challenge for Mr. Coll and Wine Disciples may be the location on a slightly gritty strip of West 29th Street. It’s partly hip, since The Nomad is nearby, but Penn Station is too.

ARCA U.S. NEWS GOP Reworks Budget Terms In Bow to Conservatives, Health Cuts Likely to Be Paired With Government Funding By Janet Hook WASHINGTON-House Republican Republican leaders, hoping to quell a conservative rebellion in their ranks, are moving to advance legislation explicitly linking cuts to President Barack Obama’s signature signature health-care law with funding to keep the government open this fall. The move represents a retreat from a plan advanced last week by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.) that called for only a symbolic vote on the health-care law, which met stiff opposition from conservatives and tea-party activists. The new approach, which is expected to be discussed in a House GOP meeting Wednesday, would make a health-care-law funding cutoff part of a bill to keep the government operating past Sept. 30, when the current fiscal year ends. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said no final decisions would be made until after the meeting. GOP leaders are also preparing preparing for a possible vote as early as next week on raising the nation?s $16.7 trillion borrowing limit that couples it with other conservative conservative priorities, including a continued effort to delay or defund defund the health-care law and a requirement to build the contested contested Keystone XL pipeline. The likely shift in strategy is a victory, for now, for the GOP’s conservative wing and its teaparty teaparty allies, who have made dismantling dismantling the 2010 Affordable Care Act a litmus-test issue. But it lays the groundwork for weeks of partisan wrangling in the House and Senate that heightens the risk of a government shutdown. shutdown. A federal shutdown is a risk because much of the government will run out of money after Sept. 30 unless Congress acts. Mr. Boehner and his lieutenants have been trying to pass a simple funding funding extension because they believe Weary of Bloomberg’s Path, New Yorkers Seek a Change By Andrew Grossman NEW YORK-New Yorkers are conflicted about the future of their city and Mayor Michael Bloomberg near the end of his 12year 12year tenure despite record-low crime, a growing population and an economy that is adding jobs at a faster rate than the rest of the country, according to a poll released released Tuesday. That provides the backdrop for a mayor?s race in which the presumptive presumptive Democratic nominee, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, is leading Republican Joe Lhota, a former aide to Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Giuliani, 65% to 22% among likely voters in the Nov. 5 election, according according to the poll conducted by Marist College Sunday and Mon day for The Wall Street Journal and NBC 4 New York. It is the first public poll to be released since Mr. de Blasio emerged victorious from a crowded Democratic primary field after running a campaign in which he spent as much time attacking attacking Mr. Bloomberg as any of his rivals. Mr. de Blasio, a liberal Democrat who wants to raise taxes on high earners, spoke frequently frequently of a “tale of two cities” and a widening gap between the rich and poor—something he blamed on the current mayor. Mr. Lhota has said he would continue many of Mr. Bloomberg’s policies, but has also said he would bring change by more actively seeking input from city residents on government decisions. decisions. “It all adds up to a sense that although people are not displeased displeased with how things have gone in the past several decades, they nonetheless feel it?s time to turn the page.? said Lee Miringoff, Miringoff, the director of the Marist College College Institute for Public Opinion. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, a onetime Democrat who initially ran for mayor as a Republican but then became an independent, called the poll a snap shot ?influenced by months and months of campaign attacks and millions of dollars of negative negative ads.” “Here are the numbers that will matter in the end to New Yorkers: record-low crime, record-high record-high graduation rates, record record number of jobs, record-high life-expectancy, and more people are moving into the city than out for the first time in more than 60 years—a powerful endorsement of how people feel about living in New York under this mayor’s leadership,? the spokesman said. Only one-quarter of registered New York City voters think the next mayor should continue Mr. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R„ Ky.) called Tuesday fef linking the debt-ceiHng Increase to deficit-reducing measures the public will blame the GOP if a government shutdown occurs. Conservatives faulted Mr. Cantor’s proposal because it would have sent the government funding and health-care cuts to the Senate in separate pieces, allowing allowing that chamber to vote down the latter measure and move on. The new plan wraps the two initiatives in one bill, requiring requiring the Senate to remove the health-care component and send it back to the House, where it would have to pass that chamber again before the Oct. 1 deadline. GOP leaders were looking to accommodate conservatives without embracing an alternative proposed by Rep. Tom Graves (R., Ga.) that quickly gathered 70 co-sponsors, roughly one-third of Republicans in the House.

That holds true across all five boroughs, age groups, political political affiliations and the three major major ethnic groups—though African-Americans African-Americans are far more eager to move the city in a different direction direction than whites. The percentage of voters saying saying the city is going in the right direction has fallen. In November 2012,61% said the city is moving in the right direction. Now, 46% do, while 43% say it is going in the wrong direction. Still, a clear majority of voters say the city has gotten better in the past 20 years—the length of time since a Democrat, David Dinkins, Dinkins, last served as mayor.

The bill they are likely to advance advance after Wednesday’s meeting is expected to continue funding through Dec. 15 at current levels, which were set by the so-called sequester earlier this year—an annual rate of $988 billion—and ban funding for the health-care law for the same period. The debt ceiling is another matter facing a partisan fight. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew in a speech Tuesday said the Obama administration continues to insist Congress pass a debt limit increase without any conditions—especially conditions—especially any effort to repeal the health-care law. The president “will not accept measures measures that would tie a debt-limit increase to defunding or delaying delaying the Affordable Care Act,” Mr. Lew said at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “There are not and will not be negotiations gentrification of some neighborhoods neighborhoods and a record number of tourists. Vernon Austin, 67 years old, a Democrat who lives in Manhattan, Manhattan, said Mr. Bloomberg had been successful in some areas, such as better open spaces and quality of life. But he said he believed Mr. Bloomberg had done much of his good work on the backs of the city’s poor and wanted to see a new direction. “He hasn’t taken a fair amount from the rich, and the poor are still making bad wages and barely able to make it,” Mr. Austin said. The poll surveyed 930 registered registered voters and had a 3.2-percentage-point 3.2-percentage-point margin of error among that group.

Increasingly scarce are the dog-stew restaurants, low-end karaoke parlors and jewelry shops that once pervaded the area known as Jongno.

While Seoul has had redevelopment plans in place since the 1970s, it has been up to developers to buy up individual plots in Jongno, a process that has taken years. Construction companies and developers tied to the country’s large family-controlled chaebol chaebol conglomerates, along with some newer, smaller players, are betting more than $3 billion that a more mixed-use approach to modern office space—adding generous amounts of retail, entertainment entertainment and dining spacecan spacecan attract international office tenants and upscale restaurants to the downtown core. “The steady stream of construction construction has transformed Seoul’s downtown from an area with outdated office space and scarce dining options options to something that would not look out of place in any of the world’s major financial hubs,” says Darren Krakowiak, managing director of CBRE Korea Co. Later this year, for example, construction will finish on Centropolis, a prime office building with a gross floor area of about 1.5 million square feet. The developer, CTCore, is a rare Westernstyle Westernstyle player in an industry dominated by South Korea’s chaebols. CTCore also was the project manager of downtown Seoul’s only new luxury lodging lodging in the past decade, the Investors Look Past Threat By Peter Grant Investors in some real-estate real-estate markets might get a case of the jitters if a volatile dictator dictator 120 miles away habitually warns he has the ability to obliterate his neighboring country. But in South Korea, saber rattling over the past year has barely fazed investors in the real-estate market that would likely suffer the most damage if such an unthinkable event occurs. Rather, office-building deal volume in Seoul, South Korea’s largest market, has stayed strong and prices have remained remained healthy. Investors, tenants, tenants, developers and others are focused more on conventional conventional market forces than on possible Armageddon. Some investors are even looking at the recent easing of tensions between South and North Korea in the run-up to the Winter Olympics as a buying buying opportunity. “Smart institutional investors investors are not taking this as a time to flee,” said Steven Cha, a managing director of Angelo Gordon ? Co., a private-equity firm that has been active in Korea. Korea. “It’s just business as usual.” Real-estate investors aren’t oblivious when geopolitical tension intensifies.

Tower 8 was built by GL Metro City, a small local developer that sold the building to DeBrookfield DeBrookfield Property Partners LP in 2016 purchased Seoul?s International Finance Center from AIG Real Estate for $2.1 billion. Korea was $17.9 billion, up from $15.8 billion in 2016, according according to data firm Real Capital Capital Analytics. Recent deals include Angelo Gordon’s sale of Metro Tower, an office tower near Seoul Station, Station, to the South Korean unit of China’s Anbang Life Insurance Insurance Co. for 240 billion won ($220 million). Private-equity fund KKR ? Co. is in advanced talks to sell the K-Twin Tower to Samsung SRA for 700 billion billion won, a near-record price, according to people familiar with the matter. Investors generally are unperturbed unperturbed by threats of war. “There have been many instances instances over the 65 years that have created tension, but they’ve all come and gone,” said Wilson Leung, Angelo Gordon’s head of Asia.

To be sure, Seoul’s development development boom has created headaches headaches for some landlords. It will add 5.9 million square feet of new grade-A office space in the span of just four years from 2016 to 2020—equivalent to more than 10% of the current current size of the market, according according to CBRE. That has given potential tenants the upper hand in negotiations negotiations over rent. The vacancy vacancy rate is expected to rise again this year, to more than 12%—among the highest in the past two decades. But the area continues to attract foreign capital. The 33story 33story Jongno Tower, for instance, instance, was bought early last year by Alpha Investment Partners, a developer tied to the Singaporean conglomerate Keppel Corp., for 384 billion won ($350.7 million). The appeal of Jongno underscores underscores the importance of retail in the rebirth of Asian downtowns. That trend, largely the result of weak office leasing leasing and rising consumer spending, has not only pushed up the value of the buildings, but also made Jongno a burgeoning burgeoning center of nightlife. At the same time, part of Jongno’s appeal is that it occupies occupies such a historic part of Seoul—the city has been Korea’s Korea’s capital since 1392. major employers like Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Electronics Inc. and Hyundai Motor Co., tend to sign long-term leases and don’t move much. South Korea was dominated by the country’s conglomerates, conglomerates, or chaebols, and off limits limits to most foreign investors until after the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. The country responded with a broad range of financial changes including those that opened up its commercial realestate realestate market. Since then some of the biggest biggest names in the business have invested in South Korea, including Blackstone Group LP, Morgan Stanley, Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC and Canada Pension Plan Investment Investment Board.

110,1941712520,"nry news A Timely Departure From Tradition New York Lawmakers Start Work as Scheduled; Majority Leader’s Punctual Ways Threaten Capitol’s Culture of Tardiness By Erica Orden ALBANY—The New York state Legislature may have a reputation reputation as a nest of dysfunction, but in at least one corner of the state Capitol, order reigns. Since the start of this year, New York state Assembly majority majority leader Joseph Morelle has forced what amounts to a radical new regulation on the legislative body: Session meetings must begin begin on time. Yes, the Legislature is still producing examples of chronic corruption, and nearly half the state?s voters would be willing to oust their representative, according according to a poll released earlier this month. Still, Mr. Morelle’s achievement, achievement, which may sound like a minimal standard for orderly lawmaking, represents a startling startling transformation in Albany. Under previous majority leaders leaders in the last decade or so, members say, the Assembly typically typically started its session 30 minutes minutes to two hours late, with the average delay about an hour. On days congested with budget budget negotiations, the session GNY WATCH ♦ NEW YORK Fewer Students Are Placed In Schools? Gifted Program Only about half of the students who qualified for New York City?s gifted and talented program received placement offers, a significant drop from last year after the city changed its admissions policies, according to data released by the Department of Education on Friday. This year, 54% of eligible students were offered slots In the city?s gifted and talented program, which provides accelerated learning opportunities for advanced students in grades K through 3. Last year, 72.5% received offers Previously, officials had guaranteed a seat in a district program for children with qualifying scores, if they applied to every available program The city changed its policy this year because many families ended up not enrolling, officials said. Of the 11.876 students who scored in the 90th percentile or above-the cut-off for district programs—5.217 were offered slots For the five elite citywide programs, which accept students who score in the 97th percentile or above, more than Z800 kmdergartners qualified for only about 300 spots Sophia Hollander Espada Is Given Five Years in Prison Continued from page A17 to 60 months, Judge Block said his “normal practice” is “not remanding remanding anyone? in Mr. Espada’s Espada’s position—a first-time offender offender convicted of nonviolent crimes. He usually allows them to surrender themselves after the Bureau of Prisons picks a prison, he said. That process can take up to a month. But Judge Block said he determined determined that Mr. Espada violated violated his order last week not to have any further contact with the jurors from his case. “This suggests to me that I cannot trust him,? the judge said to Mr. Espada’s lawyer.

On Wednesday, Mr. Espada filed an affidavit from juror Luis Ramon. In it, Mr. Ramon stated that on May 14, the jury foreman notified notified the judge’s clerk the jury was deadlocked. ?Within minutes of the deadlock, deadlock, Judge Block entered the jury room and spoke to all the jurors,” the affidavit stated. “Judge Block stated that we should calm down and reach a verdict in this case.? The jury reached a partial verdict that morning finding Mr. Espada guilty of four counts of embezzlement but deadlocking on a fifth theft count. On Friday, Judge Block dismissed dismissed Mr. Espada’s allegations. founder of Gristedes Foods, has to tread carefully in maintaining connections to the city?s elite. Rob Ryan, a spokesman for the candidate, said the majority of the friendraiser events have been held in Manhattan and none have been held in the Bronx, but “friendraisers “friendraisers have been held around the city” and attendees have been among a wide socioeconomic spectrum. “The events outside Manhattan are drawing large crowds and attracting GOP primary primary voters, building the enthusiasm enthusiasm we need to win,” he said. Friendraisers have been held in middle-class neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn. One in Flushing earlier this month, organized organized by Chuck Sullivan, a former former New England Patriots executive, executive, lured Queens residents, who were served lobster. Nonetheless the events have created an opportunity for rivals to paint Mr. Catsimatidis as outof-touch. outof-touch. “Whether it’s bankrolling bankrolling political committees or subsidizing subsidizing events, the only support ?As a team, we decided it?s one thing we want to institute,” said Mr. Morelle, who added of his predecessors that “everybody has their own style” of running the sessions. ?We’re in a business where there’s a lot that changes and you have to be pretty flexible. So to the extent that I can provide He said there was no note passed from the jury to his clerk regarding a deadlock that morning. morning. He said at 10:35 a.m. the court received a note saying the jury had reached a partial verdict. verdict. At 10:37 a.m., the judge said phone records, which he subsequently subsequently introduced into evidence Friday, showed his clerk made a call from chambers to the judge’s home telephone informing informing him of the verdict. The judge said he then drove in from his home in the West Village and entered the Brooklyn federal court underground garage garage at 11:48 a.m. Swipe card records records show he got on the elevator elevator three minutes later and two minutes after that he was in his chambers. At about 12:06 p.m. that day, the judge said, he took the jury’s verdict. John has in this campaign is the kind he’s bought and paid for,” said Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman spokeswoman for Republican mayoral hopeful Joe Lhota. Mr. Ryan responded: ?Obviously, ?Obviously, the Lhota campaign is jealous.? He added that Mr. Catsimatidis is ?drawing large crowds and winning support in all five boroughs.” The other candidates have to raise money, and the times they spend talking to people without charge tend to be on walking tours and at mayoral forums. A spokesman for Bill de Blasio said many of the Democratic candidate?s candidate?s fundraisers are low-cost, allowing more people to attend. Mr. Ryan said anything at a friendraiser that isn’t paid for by the candidate will be reported to the New York City Campaign Finance Finance Board as an in-kind contribution, contribution, a type of donation that is maxed out at $4,950 per donor under city law. As of May 15, the candidate had not reported reported any in-kind contributions some degree of predictability, we want to do that.” Mr. Morelle has had assistance assistance in this pursuit, particularly from legislators in other leadership leadership positions, including Speaker Sheldon Silver and Assemblyman Jeffrion Aubry. Tve been here 21 years, and I was known to come and sit and wait for folks,? said Mr. Aubry, a Queens Democrat who serves as Speaker pro tempore. “That’s always always been my orientation, and I presume in many ways that mast be Joe’s, too.” A spokesman for Mr. Silver, Mike Whyland, said that “members “members don’t want to waste their time if there is not a quorum, so the Speaker and Majority Leader Morelle had a discussion at the beginning of the year about starting session on time.” “It creates a climate of mutual mutual respect—members arrive on time knowing session will start in a timely manner,? Mr. Whyland Whyland said. Previous majority leaders recalled recalled their frustration with getting getting the sessions out of the gate. Former Assemblyman Paul Tokasz became majority leader The judge said he was denying denying the motion to set aside the verdict. “In light of this evidence that there is simply no way I could have spoken to the jurors between the time they arrived and reached their verdict,” he said. When given a chance to speak before being sentenced, Mr. Espada, Espada, who filed the motion without without the assistance of his lawyer, told the judge that for strategic reasons he wasn’t going to discuss discuss the juror’s claims. Mr. Espada also was ordered to forfeit $368,000 to the government, government, make $368,000 in restitution restitution to victims and pay $118,000 in back taxes. Mr. Espada said, “I do look forward to the opportunity to be employed again, to work again and to make amends, mostly A ?friendraiser? for John Catsimatidis at the Metropolitan Club in May other than from himself. Mr. Ryan said he couldn’t say with certainty that all events thus far have been self-funded but ?event filings sometimes lag because someone hasn’t been billed— that’s why you amend filings or put it in the next filing.” How much the friendraisers will help Mr. Catsimatidis remains remains unclear. He has trailed Mr. Lhota in polls, though the GOP primary is difficult to survey because because there are so few registered Republican voters. Many who atin atin 2001, before the legislative body did away with the practice of so-called fast roll call. That allowed allowed a member who had signed in to be automatically counted thereafter as a “yes” vote—regardless vote—regardless of whether he or she was seated. Because members weren?t accustomed accustomed to having to be seated for the first vote of the day, Mr. Tokasz faced an uphill battle when attempting to coax them to the chamber. “It got to the point where I was harassing members,? said Mr. Tokasz, who added that he recalled tracking down one absent lawmaker at the Saratoga raceway, north of the capital. “I was good natured about it, but it didn?t do much for my blood pressure.” The old habits can be hard to break, and Mr. Morelle and his colleagues have relied on various strategies to corral the Assembly’s Assembly’s 150 members to the chamber chamber on time. Bill votes can’t begin without a quorum, but Mr. Morelle uses the interim period before the required required number of lawmakers arrive arrive to introduce guests, announce announce resolutions or ask with my family.” Judge Block said he was going to refer “what appears to be a false affidavit” to the Brooklyn federal prosecutor’s office for ?possible prosecution for perjury and obstruction of justice.” Mr. Ramon, who wrote the affidavit affidavit that Mr. Espada submitted, submitted, was in the courtroom Friday but left soon after Judge Block made those statements. ?Nobody told me to lie,” he said adding that the trial was a year ago and “I could be mistaken.” Asked if he thought he may be prosecuted, Mr. Ramon said, “I’m concerned but I’m just recalling recalling what occurred in the jury room.? Outside the courthouse, Ms. Lynch said, “of course we’ll look into that and do what’s appropriate.” appropriate.” tended the events said they came away impressed with the candidate’s business-sawy and willingness to engage in candid, one-on-one conversations. At the least, he has made connections connections with the types of New Yorkers who appear frequently at high-profile charity events. After talking with Mr. Catsimatidis Catsimatidis at the Metropolitan Club, Ms. Farkas said she counted him as a friend, like she does Mr. Bloomberg. ?He’s sincere,? she said. “Not a politician.” committees to leave and meet in a room nearby. The introduction of guests can be used to lure members to the chamber: They typically want to personally introduce introduce their own guests, but they lose that opportunity if they’re not in the chamber by the start of session. “There’s long been a culture of hurry up and wait in the Assembly, Assembly, and Joe?s punctuality gone a long way toward getting things started on time,” said Democratic Assemblyman Micah Kellner, whose district includes the Upper East Side. The on-time legislative sessions sessions have hardly proved a cureall cureall for Albany’s ills, and even Mr. Morelle cautioned against inflating inflating the significance of the effort. “At the end of the day it’s the decisions we make on policy that matter to the people of the state,? he said. Ms. Lupardo recalled her pleasant surprise when she realized realized she could expect on-time sessions on Mr. Morelle’s watch. ?I said, is this something you’re consciously doing? He said, ’Absolutely.’ ’Absolutely.’ He knows what it’s like to be on the other side of this.” FDNY Will Pay $1 Million To Women By Pervaiz Shallwani The Fire Department of New York has agreed to pay $1 million million in back wages and change hiring practices under a settlement settlement in a gender-discrimination gender-discrimination lawsuit brought by five women who claimed they were passed over for promotions despite despite receiving impeccable evaluations. evaluations. The women, all members of the FDNY emergency-medical service, will divide $1.06 million in compensation, said Yetta Kurland, the lead attorney for the women. The money represents represents the difference in salary had they been promoted. The outcome means the five will also receive pensions in line with their increased salaries. Under the settlement, filed Friday in State Supreme Court, the FDNY also agreed to increase increase efforts to notify women about opportunities for promotion promotion to the upper echelon of the EMS, and make sure they have a full understanding of their rights to appeal if they feel they have been unfairly evaluated evaluated for a promotion “Is it solving all of the problems. problems. no,? Ms. Kurland said. ?But we hope these are big steps forward.? The settlement stems from a gender-bias lawsuit. Among those named in the suit included Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the City of New York, the FDNY and former FDNY Commissioner Nicholas Scoppeta. The settlement carries carries no admission of guilt. A spokesman for the city law department said the settlement brought an “appropriate resolution” resolution” to claims that occurred years ago. “The FDNY takes immense immense pride in its 947 female EMS employees and dedicates substantial resources to fostering fostering an equitable and positive work environment for all,” the spokesman said. The 947 women make up 26% of the total EMS force. Women hold 25 of the 105—or 24%—of the discretionary appointments, appointments, ranks such as captain captain and chief, said FDNY chief spokesman Frank Gribbon. Four of the women in the lawsuit have retired from the FDNY, and a fifth is expected to do so next month, Ms. Kurland said. Retirement wasn?t a condition condition of the settlement. “I?m hoping that what comes out of this, they’ll think twice and have a more structured interview interview practice,” said retired Capt. Kathleen Gonczi, who said she had interviewed six times over 10 years before being promoted promoted to captain. She said if there were an exam for a captain, she would have been promoted earlier. ?We were able to prove that we had more experience and better credentials than men that were promoted before us,” she said. “We were tenacious and we didn?t go away.? _",6/15/2013,"('candidate', 'praised', 'the')","('the', 'meatpacking', 'district')","[' The candidate candidate praised the gentrification of the Meatpacking District: “Isn’t it unbelievable?

The announcement comes as an influx of mobile applications are testing the limits of New York?s strict taxi regulations, which bar the prearrangement of rides in yellow cabs.

120,1940483351,"INTERNATIONAL PltOl?ERTY: SINGAPORE A Push to Preserve the Past By Shibani Mahtani Like most Asian cities, Singapore Singapore is known for paving over its past in favor of tall skyscrapers and megahighways. But increasingly its residents and some developers are cashing in on the city-state’s rich historical historical heritage, as a preservationist ethos spreads in Asia. Singapore’s Tio», Banru neighborhood is one of the leading leading examples. Bui!* in the 1930s, its low-rise, prewar Art Deco flats are unlike the glass-andsteel glass-andsteel towers and hulking government-housing government-housing estates that dominate dominate much of Singapore. Originally intended as an affordable affordable housing project by British colonial rulers, the cluster of walk-up houses across roughly two-dozen blocks just west of downtown was awarded special conservation status in 2003, which restricted any plans to knock down the buildings. An Australian barista, among the first of a wave of new residents residents in the neighborhood, set up a cafe called 40 Hands in late 2010 and was soon followed by an independent book shop, startup startup companies and a boutique selling quirky home accessories like milk jugs shaped as cows. Newer residents live alongside wholesalers, elderly residents and food sellers making traditional traditional paus, or Chinese buns with fillings. Residents have seen the value of apartments under 1,000 square feet jump to as high as 1.6 million Singapore dollars (US$1.3 million) from around SS700.000 (US$508,000) two years ago, according to Alvin Yeo, a property agent with Knight Frank Property Network who specializes in Tiong Bahru real estate. Before 2005, he said, the same units were selling for just SS350.000. The gains have come even as overall property prices have dipped slightly in Singapore this year. “There was always a demand for Tiong Bahru property, especially especially to those arty types who wanted something different,” Mr. Yeo said.

Although Although Singaporean leaders have saved more of the city-state’s colonial colonial core than many other Asian cities such as Bangkok or Jakarta—including historic shophouses shophouses in designated areas such as Chinatown and Little India— conservationists have long argued argued that other important sites and residential areas have been torn down or upgraded without concern for history. For example, the old National Library on Singapore’s Stamford Road, with roots tracing back to Stamford Raffles, the British founder of modern Singapore, was destroyed in 2004 to make way for a little-used tunnel for vehicles. Pressure on the government to tame such development has intensified in recent years, though, with many residents looking to cities like New York and London that long ago became became more conscious of historic preservation. In one of their biggest successes, successes, residents recently convinced convinced Singapore leaders to preserve preserve portions of a 26-kilometer (16-mile) railway line that once connected Singapore to neighboring neighboring Malaysia after its service was discontinued last year. Environmentalists Environmentalists envisioned the corridor, which passes through some of Singapore’s most-valuable most-valuable property, as something like the High Line on New York’s West Side, offering a lush walkway walkway through the city. They turned to social media to build grass-roots support. Officials have said they would protect at least some of it, though details aren’t likely to be announced until Singapore’s next master plan for urban development development is released in 2013.

The demonstrators were protesting soaring apartment rents and the increasing gentrification gentrification of the leafy working-class working-class neighborhood of Neukolln. “It will change a lot of the area—we are afraid,” said Christoph Bohm, an artist who leases space for his art gallery nearby and brought a large fake pig to register his disgust. disgust. Major global cities like San Francisco, New York and London London are groaning under the stress of fast-increasing populations populations that are far outpacing the creation of new housing. But few cities face a quandary quandary as difficult as Berlin?s. More than 40,000 new residents residents a year have been piling in recently, as Berlin has become become a magnet for European youth. Yet no more than 8,000 housing units a year were added through 2014, according to real-estate firm JLL, a yawning gap that lies at the heart of Berlin?s housing problems problems today. The housing crisis, as many here refer to it, is poised to get worse as it mixes with Europe’s Europe’s migration crisis. Berlin expects population growth to double to about 80,000 this year thanks to added asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere, elsewhere, with tens of thousands more expected in the next few years. Officials are now scrambling scrambling to come up with solutions, solutions, pondering ways to quickly build housing specifiNazi-Era specifiNazi-Era Airport Has Unclear Future By Eliot Brown BERLIN-The sprawling terminal terminal building at Tempelhof Airport is rich with architectural architectural grandeur and historical significance, having been a massive Nazi building project in the 1930s and the center of the Berlin Airlift in the Cold War. One problem: Berlin doesn’t know what to do with it. Officials have been pondering pondering just what to do with the 3.2-million-square foot mix of office space, airport functions and hangars ever since it closed to aviation in 2008. But creation creation of a plan has proved elusive, elusive, in part because of its vast scale—it was one of the world’s largest contiguous buildings when it was completed by the Nazis in 1941—and substantial investment needs. The problems illustrate the difficulty facing governments trying to reuse giant publicly owned projects. Even in cities with booming property markets, markets, government officials can be hobbled by cost concerns and tugged in different directions directions by various constituencies. A prior plan for the broader 877-acre airport property bigger bigger than New York?s Central Park—was halted last year when voters passed a referendum referendum mandating the field stay off-limits to development and preserved for public use. Demonstrators in August protested rising apartment rents and increasing gentrifkation in the Neukolln neighborhood.

While overall construction is picking up—around 12,000 units are expected this year— it remains far short of what is needed to accommodate the throngs of new residents. The reasons are numerous, from high construction costs and lengthy waits for approvals approvals to a tenant-friendly political political landscape keen on imposing imposing rent controls. The supply-demand imbalToday imbalToday the terminal building houses a few city agencies, a small technology hub and is occasionally occasionally used to host events. Much of the space, though, is empty office space that would need substantial investment to bring up to usable standards. The terminal also is part of the national debate about the influx of refugees, with officials hoping to use some of its hangars hangars as temporary housing for asylum seekers. This fall, city officials want to put an end to the uncertainty and craft a firm road map for the centrally located building, which is about three miles from the city center. The idea is to have a master plan by early next year—and officials are pondering an array of cultural and money-generating uses. “This building is more than just a real-estate asset,” said Christoph Schuster, head of building management for Tempelhof Tempelhof Projekt GmbH, the cityrun cityrun organization crafting the terminal?s future. Other examples of megasites that have proved difficult include include Governors Island in New York, the 170-acre former Coast Guard base dotted with old brick buildings, for which city officials have long been trying to identify a use beyond a seasonal seasonal park.

Even Paris’ Gare d?Orsay, the ornate former train station that was converted into a highly successful impressionist museum museum in 1986, was the subject of a yearslong debate and was nearly demolished. Tempelhof has a deep history. history. The airport opened in the 1920s and the Nazis built the terminal building as an apparent apparent symbol of the regime?s ambitions ambitions in aviation. At the rime, Adolf Hitler?s architects planned for much of Berlin to resemble the buildings there, with beige facades considered a mix of neoclassical and modernist modernist architecture. During World War II, the Nazis used it as a forced labor camp. After the war, it fell under U.S. control and during the late 1940s, it was the epicenter of market rates. Landlords have protested, arguing their potential potential for profit has been dramatically dramatically curtailed. Below-market rents have enticed even more aspiring renters to vie for vacant units in popular neighborhoods. “It’s a lottery,” said Veit Nickel, one of roughly three dozen people to show up in August to look at a small apartment being offered for rent in the neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. Mr. Nickel, 29 years old, said he has been searching for more than five weeks. One time, he said, he showed up to look at an apartment but the broker didn’t let him apply because because he had printed off only about 100 applications. As recently as the late 1990s, Berlin officials were discussing what to do about a housing surplus. The city lost population during the years when East Berlin was under Communist rule and West Berlin was a western island in the Eastern Bloc. The economy remained sluggish after reunification, leaving tens of thousands of units uninhabited or in need of the Berlin Airlift, when U.S. and British planes ferried shipments shipments of coal and supplies to West Berlin after the Soviets cut off road access. Subsequently, Subsequently, it was used as a small commercial airport until it was retired in 2008. City officials first focused their plans to reuse the airport on the surrounding field. They hoped to use the edges as a site for 4,700 units of much-needed new housing, while the center would be preserved as a park. But neighbors and residents worried about the loss of public space throughout Berlin and passed a measure that blocked the plan last year. Since then, officials have been more focused on the terminal terminal building, concluding that whatever the future use looks like, it will be varied. Because of its historic and public significance, significance, there is no appetite for major renovation. Entire floors were even removed from Soviet-style housing projects to decrease vacancy. In many ways, that makes Berlin much like the major U.S. cities that were depopulated depopulated in the second half of the 20th century and now are undergoing undergoing a renaissance. Berlin today is being reinvigorated by a flood of young adults— many from European countries with flagging economies—enjoying economies—enjoying the low cost of living and vibrant urban life. The median rent has risen 50% since 2009, and even more in the desirable innercity innercity neighborhoods. Developers Developers can charge market rates for new rental projects, but demand at the upper end is far less than that for those affordable affordable to low- and middle-income middle-income Berliners, for whom new supply is most sparse. In policy circles there is consensus that the answer is to create fresh supply. “We have a tremendous need for housing units,” said Martin Pallgen, spokesman for the city’s Department of Urban Development and the Environment. Environment. selling the entire structure to a developer, for instance. Instead, the city is looking to do a long-term lease for a small piece of the building with a hotel hotel developer. Another section, officials familiar with the matter matter say, could involve converting converting much of the empty and city-leased office space to space available for startup tech companies companies and small businesses, offering offering an incubator-like environment. environment. In addition, project officials say a component with a museum is likely. ?We are discussing creative economy and cultural uses and museums and events,” said Stefan Stefan Evers, a member of the Berlin Berlin House of Representatives involved involved with the redevelopment plans. Still, he said, at least some of the uses must bring in money for the city. ?In the end, it has to be economically successful successful as well.” Startups Seize On Cheap Offices By Eliot Brown BERLIN—Ever since the Berlin Wall fell, as this city has healed, its office market has struggled amid cheap rents and ample empty space. No longer. Fast-growing technology companies feasting on Berlin?s educated youth and cheap prices have put a jolt in this sleepy market, gobbling up empty space and pushing up rents. With Berlin becoming a center of startup activity in Europe, firms ranging from big German online retailer Zalando Zalando SE to small anonymous startups are setting up shop. The tech sector accounted for 36% of the space leased in the first half of the year, according to real-estate services firm Colliers International. That demand has been a driving force in pushing office vacancy to 4.3% as of the second second quarter, with about 800,000 square meters (8.6 million square feet) free throughout the city, according to Colliers. By comparison, the vacancy rate was 8% in 2011. “Berlin feels a little bit like if you were to take San Francisco Francisco from 1999 and move it forward,” said John Mulliken, who runs Wayfair.com’s international international operations. The Boston-based Boston-based online home decor retailer one year ago had about 25 people in Berlin, but since then it has grown to 190. Mr. Mulliken says he is in the process of signing a lease that will give the company enough space for 450. igy firm ling up race and Many a city has proclaimed itself the Silicon Valley of its region only to become an alsoran alsoran in the tech race. The inherently inherently volatile startup world is particularly prone to leaving its hosts disappointed—and without rent checks. But if the growth spurt continues continues and expands, it would mark a big shift for the Berlin economy, which in many ways has been trying to find traction traction ever since the wall fell in 1989. At the time, optimism and euphoria that greeted reunification reunification was coupled with a wave of money from investors and speculators who assumed major private employers would flock to the city. Developers Developers rushed to build, anticipating anticipating strong demand would fill their buildings. But companies never came—or certainly not to the level once hoped. Vacancy remained remained high, rents stayed far below expectations, and investors investors were burned. For the years after, the market was more stagnant—dominated by government and branches of financial Firms with predictable, predictable, slow growth. That began to shift after the downturn around 2009, as the city became a small locus of startups. With many of these once-tiny companies expanding, expanding, Berlin is now considered considered by many to rival London as Europe’s startup capital. “You get a lot of access to great talent—you have people all over the world who want to move here,” said Jakob Schreyer, chief executive of Orderbird AG, a 110-person restaurant industry software startup located above a courtyard courtyard in an old Kreuzberg warehouse.",10/7/2015,"('the', 'increasing', 'gentrification')","('the', 'leafy', 'workingclass')",[' The demonstrators were protesting soaring apartment rents and the increasing gentrification gentrification of the leafy working-class working-class neighborhood of Neukolln.'], The demonstrators were protesting soaring apartment rents and the increasing gentrification gentrification of the leafy workingclass workingclass neighborhood of Neukolln

Prices of office buildings, hotels, hotels, apartment properties, retail retail centers and other commercial commercial real estate in Chicago fell by 4.1% over the past year, according according to research firm Real Capital Analytics. That was the worst performance among major major metropolitan areas analyzed by the company, behind even crisis-stricken Hong Kong, where prices fell 2.6%. Unlike New York, where prices have recently cooled after after years of frenzied growth, Chicago never saw much of a boom to begin with. Property values are barely above their pre-financial-crisis peak. The dollar value of commercial commercial real-estate sales in Cook County, which includes Chicago, fell by 42% this year, Real Capital Capital said. Sales also fell in several several counties that include parts of greater Chicago, including in neighboring Indiana. The picture is similar for the city’s residential real estate.

It was Andy Warhol as famous for surrounding himself with people as Garbo was for shunning them but in some ways even more sealed off. Two creative yet troubled souls in fleeting not-quite-conveigence, drifting among the yellow cabs and skyscrapers: The image is emblematic of ‘The Lonely City,” Olivia Laing’s poignant study of urban isolation and withdrawal. Ms. Laing’s first book. “To the River” (2011), was about the River Ouse and Virginia Woolf, who drowned herself in it. Her second, “The Trip to Echo Spring” (2013), was a liquid travelogue of a different kind, in which Ms. Laing crossed the US. in pursuit of a deeper understanding of six alcoholic writers (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Cheever. Tennessee Williams, Williams, John Berryman and Raymond Carver). Several of its themes and techniques carry over into “The Lonely City.” Here too. the English Ms. Laing displays a soft spot for America and Americans. She again considers a form of human miseryloneliness, miseryloneliness, that is—as experienced by artists and does so by blending commentary commentary on their lives and works with findings from psychology and other social sciences. This time, however, she restricts her compass to New York and more extensively interweaves interweaves her own sufferings. These became acute when, just after after moving to New York to be with her boyfriend, she was dumped. Finding Finding herself profoundly lonely, she gravitated toward artists whose work touched on her condition, “particularly “particularly as it manifests in the modem city.” Not surprisingly, one was Edward Edward Hopper. T kept coming back to Hopper’s images.” she writes, “drawn to them as if they were blueprints and I was a prisoner; as if they contained some vital clue about my state.” To her. they suggested that “loneliness was something worth looking at” and that “looking itself was an antidote, a way to defeat loneliness’s strange, estranging estranging spell.? An effect of loneliness that especially especially dismayed Ms. Laing was its obliteration of her social skills and indeed indeed of her ability to conduct basic transactions. “Almost all city-dwellers,” city-dwellers,” she observes, “are daily participants participants in a complex part-song of voices ... the passing back and forth of verbal small change with near and total strangers.? Suddenly she couldn’t do it: “I was forever botching FICTION CHRONICLE: SAM SACKS Coming Home to Roost on the Bulgarian border with Turkey, an age-old stork breeding site and for centuries a point of collision between between East and West. It’s rich earth for the novelist. It begins when the narrator, a young Bulgarian immigrant, returns from America to visit his grandfather.

This is inauspicious. inauspicious. since the imam bears his grandfather an ancient grudge. Worse.

In a way reminiscent of Tea Obreht’s “The Tiger’s Wife.” Mr. Penkov Penkov seeds his story with folklore from the ancient Thracians through the Communist era. many involving the superstitious rituals surrounding St. Kosta’s fever. But the book’s main attractions are the narrator’s two confidants.

D953). the ballgame of language: fumbling my catches, bungling my throws.” It was this verbal clumsiness— doubly mortifying to a writer, of course—that made for an affinity with Warhol. Watching interviews with him, Ms. Laing was “struck by how hard he seemed to be struggling with the demands of speech.” Subsequently Subsequently she zeroed in on the significant significant portion of Warhol’s work “devoted “devoted to human speech.” In 1965 he acquired a tape recorder to which he became so attached that he called it “my wife.” “The first thing he did with his new wife,” Ms. Laing writes, “was to make a book, entitled a, a novel, composed entirely of recorded speech; a celebratory tour de force of idle and unintelligible language, around which loneliness hovers like a sea mist.? Warhol has been criticized for “needling confessions out of the vulnerable and drug-addicted,” but Ms. Laing seems moved by the way this tongue-tied, hypersensitive, contact-dreading contact-dreading artist managed, with the help of a simple gadget, to become become a kind of mumbling anthropologist anthropologist among damaged tribes. The middle chapters of “The Lonely City” center on David Wojnarowicz, Wojnarowicz, who in the 1970s became a prominent New York artist, and Henry Darger, the “outsider artist nonpareil” who. living as an urban hermit, produced produced hundreds of “beautiful, baffling watercolours of naked little girls with penises, at play in rolling landscapes,? along with a 15,000-page fantasy novel. Ms. Laing persuasively considers considers both men through the lens of loneliness, and the fact that Darger never set foot in New York (he scarcely left Chicago) does no real harm to her pattern. ther, a foxy old raconteur, is a fading repository of village traditions: “An old man’s mind is a mountain, each memory a milk-washed bell. It?s true. God holds the future, which is uncertain uncertain and unknown, so let him hold it. But the old man holds the past. The past is certain.? Mr. Penkov is an eager, inviting writer. But he’s so bursting with tales that he can’t stop, and the weakness of “Stork Mountain” is its overly extended extended conclusion. That finale, when it comes, is bom of another collision. An age-old stork breeding site in Turkey is a collision point between Hast and West. as the ghosts of the past invade the present and drive the characters toward toward a dance with fire.

It’s telling that she drops her one small bombshell, namely that she is “not at all comfortable in the gender gender box to which I’d been assigned.” almost in passing, as if her dysphoria were beside the point. For all that, I regret to say I liked only the first two-thirds of the book. The different flavor of the last third stems from Ms. Laing’s wish to show that “loneliness is ... also political.? Returning to David Wojnarowicz. who died of AIDS, she looks at how its stigma entailed an extra burden of loneliness for him and other gay artists. Then she addresses the loneliness loneliness of prowling—as she herself did to excess during the two years covered covered by the book—“the endless city of the internet” and goes on to wonder wonder if it’s “a coincidence that computers computers achieved dominance” just as AIDS made us terrified of bodily contact. contact. In her final chapters, these two strands of discourse, about AIDS and found grief, and then she is aware of a wish to get it over with, to get Gussie Gussie into the ground.” But as the title suggests, many of these stories concern what goes on between the sheets of sexa- and sep- tuagenarian couples.

She makes them, however, at the expense of her prose, as well as her sense of nuance, proportion and logic. Dreary buzzwords like “site” and “gaze” proliferate. proliferate. There’s much talk of systems (“entrenched and toxic systems,” “systems of power and of malice?), “structural injustice,” “late capitalism” capitalism” and so forth. People are becoming becoming “more intolerant of difference.” more unwilling “to let other lifeforms lifeforms coexist.? Other life-forms? This eruption of flying-saucer language points up the effects of Ms. Laing’s swerve into polemic. But I mustn’t exaggerate. Even at her most stridently engagee, Ms. Laing Laing is never self-righteous, and every page of “The Lonely City” exudes a disarming, deep-down fondness for humanity. It ends with her largely overcoming her loneliness “not by meeting someone or by falling in love, but rather by handling the things that other people had made”—absorbing their art, she means. Though she resists resists the temptation to quote E.M. Forster’s “Only connect!” (literature’s answer to “Keep calm and carry on”), her book amounts to a quiet injunction injunction to do just that, and such reminders, reminders, however inescapably sentimental always do us good.

On this true-life foundation, author author Jonathan Lee—British-born; Brooklyn-dwelling—has constructed the beguiling “High Dive” (Knopf, 321 pages, $26.95), a highly amusing amusing and ultimately very moving novel. The book centers on a trio of characters: Moose, a former highdiver highdiver turned assistant hotel-manager; hotel-manager; Freya, his fetching, insecure 18year-old 18year-old daughter; and Dan, an IRA explosives man trying to keep his humane impulses sealed off from his covert assignment. Not a thriller in the usual sense. “High Dive” resembles the unorthodox unorthodox disaster movie one of Moose’s hotel employees tells him she once planned to make: “But instead of [the catastrophe] happening at the start of the movie ... it would happen happen at the end.” Why? “Because I lighly amusing anti ultimately moving, this novel is hardly a thriller in the usual sense. sometimes the before is more interesting interesting than the after, no?

But for all the struggles of the literary East Village, there’s also confidence—even in the closure of the Bowery Poetry Club, which hopes to reopen its space at 308 Bowery later in the year in a partnership with Duane Park, the upscale TriBeCa burlesque club. 530 PARK AVENUE SALES SUITE MODEL RESIDENCE NOWOPEN 5ROparkcondo.com Park Avenue at 61st St +1 212 371 0530 By Appointment Only CUMfC MARKETIN?

But very little of the neighborhood neighborhood is populated by patternmakers, patternmakers, cutters, sewers, pressers or Finishers anymore. Earlier this year, Ms. Randall issued a Request for Proposals from marketing marketing and branding firms to come up with a new name for the neighborhood. She said that she and her organization would prefer something more reflective of the neighborhood’s current denizens—predominantly online media companies and architecture architecture firms. Such a pairing might not have succeeded in the pre-glamorous pre-glamorous Bowery, which is increasingly increasingly the home of designers and boutiques. But infused with Duane Park?s New Orleans-inflected Orleans-inflected style, the revamped club could straddle the preferences of the old and new neighborhood neighborhood more easily. The ink is barely dry on the partnership, and the still-pending proposal must be approved by the local community board. “I have a feeling it was a utopian utopian vision that we came into,” Mr. Holman said. “But when it has the dynamics of the triumph triumph of capitalism playing on it, I’d rather have a really good restaurant along with the other good restaurants on the Bowery that can support the poetry.?

Under the proposed plan, the poetry club would operate in the space on Sundays and Mondays, and Duane Park would program the rest of the week. The arrangement arrangement is flexible, they said, allowing allowing for cross-over or joint events such as poetry dinners. “New York isn’t what it used to be. it doesn’t have the edge it used to,? said Ms. Ferrarin. “But joining together, we’ll be able to keep doing what we believe in.” Perhaps more important, Mr. Holman said, the arrangement will allow him to concentrate on sustaining a poetry legacy in the East Village. “The roots of the poetry community are very, very deep—we are used to struggle,? he said. “It’s just that we spread ourselves thin by wanting to be the meeting place for bohemia. That was not sustainable.” Manhattan Rents Continued from page A17 band, Nick Smallwood, moved to the Upper East Side in late 2009 after she had lived in Williamsburg Williamsburg and then Park Slope for 13 years and was feeling priced out. “We could afford the tiniest studio studio you’ve ever seen in Park Slope, or move to the Upper East Side and live in a brownstone,” Ms. Artibee said. She hesitated when asked whether she considered her new neighborhood “cool.? But she said she and her husband have grown to love the area around their apartment on 87th Street between York and East End avenues, avenues, which “has the charm that you would want in Brooklyn that is quickly disappearing.? Indeed, the Upper East Sidelong Sidelong a denizen of society matrons matrons and recent college graduates—has graduates—has seen an influx of trendy establishments, including gastro pub Jones Wood Foundry: a taco place, Cascabel Taqueria; City Swiggers, a craft-beer store; and the newest outpost of Pony Bar, a craft-beer bar. “It’s exploding with young people and tattoos,? said Ms. Artibee. Artibee. The other day, she and her husband saw something they never expected on 87th Street. “These hipsters were moving in—you could tell they were hipsters hipsters because I used to be one too, so they stand out—and they were moving a mounted moose head into their apartment,? she said. Josh Wolinsky, a 28-year-old restaurant server and aspiring author, is one such young person who has moved—in his case to the Upper East Side a few years ful space that is adaptable to almost almost any business.” The branding proposals were due last week. Ms. Randall refused refused to tip her hand, but she said the Fashion Center Business Improvement District will “take some time to consider what’s been submitted.” Far from its peak in the 1950s, the Garment District now houses approximately 7,000 production jobs. Most of the others have been moved overseas. In 1987, the city passed zoning zoning laws requiring that 50% of the space on the side streets be preserved for traditional garment garment production. But that didn’t stop the outflow of jobs. Nearly three decades later, even the fashion houses have moved, mostly to hipper neighborhoods neighborhoods like SoHo, Chelsea and the Meatpacking District.

Brooklyn. “When it came to living in a nice neighborhood, the Upper East Side was actually cheaper,” said Mr. Wolinsky, who also previously previously rented an apartment in Astoria, Queens. He and a roommate roommate pay $1,900 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in a fifth-floor walk-up. Even still, he said he hopes he won’t be a long-term Upper East Sider. ?I’d rather be living in a borough,” he said, dismissing Manhattan’s borough status. To be sure, as Brooklyn rents rise, only a lucky handful can afford afford to move back to Manhattan. Others are more likely to push deeper into southern Brooklyn— where mean studio rents in Bay Ridge, for example, remain just $1,200 a month. Other people may start looking to Queens or the Bronx. Indeed, it raises broader concerns concerns about affordability in the city—where Brooklyn neighborhoods neighborhoods that once provided a release release valve for Manhattan pricing pricing continued to become more expensive even through much of the downturn.

Diane von Furstenberg, president of the Council of Fashion Designers Designers of America, the industry trade group that still has a token presence in the Garment District, has moved her offices to trendier digs downtown. The council itself plans to move into new offices in SoHo later this summer. Regardless of the name change that is eventually proposed, proposed, the real work will be in altering the neighborhood’s ground-floor retail space. A walk along the avenues and side streets of the Garment District today reveals a mish-mash of fast-food restaurants, bodegas and banks, a scene the Fashion Center Business Improvement District feels detracts from the unique architecture of the neighborhood.

At stake are a number of things, not least a culture that the city’s Convention ? Visitors Bureau website correctly claims ?bubbles up from the streets.” This past January, dozens of musicians led a crowd of hundreds hundreds into New Orleans’s City Council chamber. “We?re here to bury the noise ordinance,? announced announced a trombonist before raising his instrument. The protest protest took musical form—a dirgelike dirgelike rendition of the hymn ?Just a Closer Walk With Thee,” a standard standard at any local jazz funeral. In April, one day before the annual Jazz ? Heritage Festival opened, council chambers were again full. The lobbying regarding regarding decibel levels and regulations of musical expression revealed growing public rifts. Some speakers speakers warned of threats to musicians’ musicians’ livelihoods and the infringement infringement of rights. Others sought protection from nuisances, nuisances, particularly the bombast of amplified music along one stretch of Bourbon Street, in the French Quarter. One contentious item was Section 66-205, which states: ?It shall be unlawful for any person to play musical instruments instruments on public rights-ofway rights-ofway between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.?

One speaker equated a proposed proposed citywide allowance for limited limited music in restaurants with making “all neighborhoods de facto entertainment districts.” Others feared steering live music mostly to designated arts-andculture arts-andculture zones, and away from the neighborhood clubs that have long nurtured a locally bred scene. As David Freedman, the general manager of listener-supported listener-supported WWOZ-FM (self-proclaimed (self-proclaimed “Guardians of the Groove?), said: ?An unintended consequence may be the death of spontaneous culture in New Orleans. Orleans. Some may think this is good for tourism and development, development, but it is not good for the distinct musical traditions at the core of our identity.” If there’s a culture war going on in New Orleans, that’s hardly news. According to historian Freddi Williams Evans’s book ?Congo Square: African Roots in New Orleans,” Congo Square— where enslaved Africans danced and drummed on Sundays—was codified by an 1817 city ordinance ordinance restricting such activities to a single spot. A 1996 photograph photograph that ran in the Times-Picayune Times-Picayune newspaper, of a protest march, showed a teenage snare drummer wearing a sign: ?I Was Pepper... And Salt THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ?If you feel guilty, they win .? Arrested for Playing Music.” The past decade lends heightened heightened context to current debate. In the years since the 2005 flood resulting from levee failures that followed Hurricane Katrina, tensions tensions surrounding culture led to clashes. In 2007, a consortium of Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs defeated, defeated, in federal court on First Amendment grounds, jacked-up city permit fees for their weekly brass-band-led second-line parades; parades; later that year, police busted up a memorial procession for a beloved tuba player, igniting igniting a fight over who owns the streets. This narrative unfolded despite the city’s pervasive use of these traditions to rekindle a tourism business that, in 2013, hosted more than nine million visitors who spent more than $6 billion. Now, as a yet undefined ?new” New Orleans rubs up against whatever is left of the old one, brass bands have been shut down on their customary street corners. corners. Music clubs have increasingly increasingly been hit with lawsuits and visited by the police responding to phoned-in complaints. A revival revival of rarely enforced ordinances ordinances has met a fresh groundswell groundswell of activism. All this has happened in the context of swift gentrification of neighborhoods such as Treme, long a hothouse The clash between musical tradition and residents of New Orleans. for indigenous culture. In any city, gentrification raises questions: What happens when those who build upon cultural cultural cachet don’t want that culture culture next door? But even longstanding longstanding residents of the city’s historic neighborhoods have had a sometimes uneasy coexistence with the city’s largely organic culture, and their legitimate quality-of-life expectations (noise, crowds, and such) beg for clear and enforceable rules. Yet in New Orleans such concerns are underscored by an exceptional truth—a functional jazz culture that is, for many, elemental to daily life and social cohesion. The Disneyfication of New Orleans Orleans that people warned of in 2005 was supposed to be quick and dramatic. But, as Alex Rawls, a veteran local music critic, told me: ?The danger is not like that. If you take your hands off the wheel and let business interests rule, that sort of thing happens more gradually, almost without people noticing.” People have noticed. The TV cameras won’t descend upon New Orleans until August, marking marking a decade since Katrina. Yet those with a stake in the city’s culture should watch closely in the coming months, when the city council plans to rule on all the above issues. New Orleans loves to relive its past. Yet simply because its culture culture has long occupied embattled space doesn’t mean that must forever be the case. Despite sometimes-heated rhetoric, those advocating for enlightened policies policies have begun speaking less like combatants than like willing partners, or as activists completing completing a mission. Jordan Hirsch, who formerly headed the nonprofit nonprofit Sweet Home New Orleans, now works with a nascent organization organization billed as a ?cultural continuity continuity conservancy.? “Where we were once focused on simply getting getting musicians home,” he said, ?the job now is to create equitable equitable policies that assure a sustainable sustainable cultural community.” During a news conference at last year’s Jazz ? Heritage Festival, Festival, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told me, ?there is a way to organize culture without killing killing it.” This year, the New Orleans City Council has the chance to craft policies that nurture culture and remove it from the cross hairs of controversy. If it can’t strike the right balance, that next brass band may not find its audience audience on a streetcorner. And that city like no other may start to sound and feel a bit more like every every place else. Mr. Blumenfeld writes about jazz for the Journal. He also blogs at blogs.artinfo.com/ blunotes. ART A Master Disregards Convention Rembrandt: The Late Works National Gallery, London Through Jan. 18 Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam Feb. 12-May 17 By Karen Wilkin London R etrospective exhibitions show us how painters and sculptors became the artists artists we know. By studying their early works, we discover the predecessors predecessors they admired and emulated emulated during their formative years. We follow their youthful struggles and, sometimes, see glimmerings of characteristics we associate with their mature efforts. Shows that examine the later years of long-lived artists afford different pleasures. Not only are we presented with fully realized, achieved works, but when we are dealing with one of those rare individuals with a “late style,” bom of innate talent, accumulated experience, and sheer daring, we often feel we are seeing things wrenched out of time by a bold disregard for convention—works that test the limits of what paintings and sculptures can be. Case in point: “Rembrandt: The Late Works” at the National Gallery, London, a brilliant survey survey of the artist’s last years— from about 1652 on—a period distinguished by dramatic changes in his approach to all mediums, from the more highly finished ?fine style” of his earlier work to a ?rough style” of broad brushstrokes, urgent gestures and loaded, crusty surfaces. Rembrandt’s drawings, etchings and paintings of his late period are so audacious that they still look radical today, almost 3K centuries centuries after his death, aged 63, in 1669. We know little of how they appeared to his contemporaries, since the first commentaries on these works were mainly written long after the fact. Rembrandt?s later years were difficult ones for the once enormously enormously successful, esteemed painter. Although he was still admired admired by some of his peers and still received some commissions, his work was less sought after and he was in such wretched financial financial straits that his belongings belongings and later his house were auctioned. His last six years saw the deaths of his common-law wife, Hendrickje Stoffels, and his only surviving son, Titus. Yet Rembrandt’s work remained bold, experimental and potent, no matter what he endured, Susan Stroman?s Met Debut By Heidi Waleson New York F or the second New Year’s Eve in a row, the Met chose an operetta as its gala fundraiser centerpiece. Thanks to the Broadway fizz contributed by director and choreographer choreographer Susan St roman in her house debut, Franz Lehar’s ?The Merry Widow” (1905) came off better than last year’s overstuffed overstuffed “Die Fledermaus.” But operetta, with its long stretches of spoken dialogue, remains an uneasy fit for this big theater and its artists, who are more comfortable projecting emotion and character through song. The principal weak link was soprano Renee Fleming, showcased showcased as Hanna Glawari, the widow of the title. (The story is about getting Hanna to marry a compatriot so that her fortune will remain in her impoverished country, Pontevedria; the prime candidate is Count Danilo, an old flame.) The role sits low for Ms. Fleming, so her voice had little presence or richness for much of the evening. Even when the part ascended into more familiar territory, territory, she sounded cautious rather than expansive, and in the patchily amplified dialogue, she came across more as a regal presence than a down-to-earth, playful former farm girl. As Valencienne, the straying wife of the Pontevedrian ambassador, ambassador, Baron Zeta, the vivacious Broadway actress Kelli O’Hara was perfectly at home in the dialogue dialogue and the dancing. Her pure soprano sounded thin and tremulous tremulous at first, but gathered strength through the evening, and she projected personality throughout. Baritone Nathan Gunn, a game Danilo, was trying so hard to be funny that he missed the character’s suave sex appeal. Tenor Alek Shrader, as Valencienne’s admirer, Camille, was appealingly ardent. Though he had some difficulty with the high notes, he and Ms. O’Hara projected more chemistry than OPERA ?Portrait of a Couple as Isaac and Rebecca/ known as ?The Jewish Bride’ (c. 1665), by Rembrandt. while his ability to create an uncanny uncanny sense of deep emotional engagement with his subjects remained remained undiminished. Witness paintings such as the Rijksmuseum’s ?Portrait of a Couple as Isaac and Rebecca,? known as ?The Jewish Bride,” painted about 1665. A quintessential quintessential ?rough style” composition of two figures bathed in warm light, against limitless darkness, this renowned canvas at once embodies intimacy and tenderness, tenderness, and celebrates the seductiveness seductiveness of paint. We savor the play of hands—his on her shoulder shoulder and on her heart; hers touching touching his—at the same time that we are captivated by the sheer gorgeousness of the troweled and scraped paint that conjures up the man’s massive golden silk sleeve and the woman’s sumptuous sumptuous red dress. We acknowledge the richness of the clothing and the lavishness of her jewelry, and then we are lost in the sensuality of the paint again. We similarly switch our attention attention from subject matter to form and materiality when we study the exhibition’s prints and drawings, drawings, with their energetic gestures gestures and mysterious darks. Several Several images are represented by pullings of different states in their development, sequences that allow us to watch Rembrandt Rembrandt think; we see him clarify and intensify the drama by wiping wiping out or darkening parts of the composition, canceling or enriching enriching the details. The exhibition is full of wellknown wellknown works: not only ‘The JewA JewA scene from Franz Leh£r?s ’The Merry Widow.? the principal pair of lovers. Thomas Allen was hilarious as the befuddled Baron Zeta, and actor Carson Elrod brought a wry goofiness to Danilo’s assistant, assistant, Njegus. The show certainly looked great, evoking turn-of-the-century turn-of-the-century Paris by way of Broadway. The sets, designed by Julian Crouch, had a flat, almost cartoonlike, cartoonlike, quality, rather like a puppet theater. The transition from Hanna’s garden, overlooking overlooking the lighted windows of Montmartre, to Maxim’s cabaret, performed in full view of the audience, audience, was itself a delightful, lighthearted piece of stagecraft. William Ivey Long’s stunning Belle Epoque and folk costumes were scene-stealers, and Paule Constable’s lighting was particularly particularly good at picking up their jeweled colors and elegant shapes. Ms. Stroman’s choreography choreography had plenty of sizzle—from the ballroom dances at the embassy embassy to the folk numbers in Act II and the can-can of Act III, the last anchored by the six Broadway Broadway dancers who played Maxim’s grisettes. However, Ms. Stroman had mixed success infusing that verve into the dialogue scenes, and the English libretto and lyrics lyrics by Jeremy Sams, though cleaner than his texts for ?Enchanted ?Enchanted Island” and ?Fledermaus,” ?Fledermaus,” had their share of selfish selfish Bride” but also “A Woman Bathing in a Stream” (1654), with her white shift hiked up above sturdy legs; the large, pensive seated nude, “Bathsheba with King David’s Letter? (1654); and the ?signature” group portrait of the black-clad dignitaries of the Amsterdam Drapers Guild, known as “The Syndics” (1662). Among other delights, there are Centuries-old works so audacious that they still look radical today. superb self-portraits, portraits, nudes and religious scenes, both familiar and unexpected, in all mediums, and the two versions of Lucretia, the Roman wife who killed herself to expiate the shame of her rape by an Etruscan nobleman; in one of these haunting haunting pictures, painted in 1666, the ashen-faced young woman has just stabbed herself, a cascade of cinnabar-red blood contrasting with her finely pleated linen and the slabby paint of her opulent sleeve. There are rarities, too, including including an enormous equestrian portrait portrait and two astonishing fragments. fragments. In one from 1656, the broadly painted vestiges of a multifigure anatomy lesson destroyed destroyed in a fire, a cadaver confronts confronts us, feet first, as brutally foreshortened as Mantegna’s dead Christ. We see only the anatomist’s hands, as he lays conscious bits (?some penniless Parisian will get his paws on it”) and thumping rhymes (?such passion within you / this cannot continue”; ?chantoozies / floozies?). floozies?). And Andrew Davis’s conducting conducting was often square and uneffervescent, so no matter how hard the show tried to take flight on stage, the orchestra kept it tethered to earth. * * * Handel’s ?Saul” (1739) is a highly dramatic oratorio that lends itself to staging, and Trinity Trinity Wall Street’s production on Friday at St. Paul’s Chapel, offered offered as part of its extensive Twelfth Night Festival (which runs through Jan. 6), was a valiant valiant effort. It was musically topnotch, topnotch, as one has come to expect from the superb Trinity Baroque Orchestra and Choir of Trinity Wall Street, under the incisive leadership of Julian Wachner. The soloists were also excellent, especially Anthony Roth Costanzo, whose sometimes piercing countertenor sounded richly nuanced and otherworldly in his portrayal of the loyal, reverent reverent David, the object of King Saul’s insane jealousy. The space was not ideal for theater, however. The stage was a raised runway with Saul’s throne at one end and a smoking brazier at the other. The audience audience sat at tables on either side of its length, or in the balcony bare the brain and an assistant looks on, holding the sawed-off brainpan. The rest of the mysterious, mysterious, horrifying scene has vanished. vanished. The other fragment is the remains remains of a huge history painting. “The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis?—a rebellion rebellion of the future Dutch against the Romans—commissioned for the new Amsterdam Town Hall. The protagonists, seated at a long table, eerily lighted from below, below, dissolve into pools of light and shadow. Even allowing for the picture’s being designed to be seen from below, at a great distance, everything seems painted with extraordinary economy, economy, with generous swipes that barely suggest dramatically lit features. It is impossible to imagine imagine how this tough, evocative picture looked to viewers in 1662, on its installation, but it is not altogether surprising that it was soon removed and replaced by a less adventurous artist’s work. Sometime after, the central portion—all that we have today— was cut from the vast canvas. “Rembrandt: The Late Works” is a splendid show, marred only by a tight, awkward installation apparently conceived without consideration of the probable attendance. attendance. Let’s hope that the Rijksmuseum Rijksmuseum provides ample space when the show travels to Amsterdam Amsterdam in February. In London, perseverance is required to see anything, but it is worth it.

The orchestra and choir were positioned on the floor at the brazier end of the runway—the choir, in particular, seemed quite far away, and its words were muffled—and Mr. Wachner had to conduct with his back to the soloists. Director James Darrah, thus limited in his options, tended to overemphasize overemphasize facial emoting and writhing on the ground. The basic costumes costumes (most of them white) by Robert and Rachel Danes suggested suggested the roles of their wearers—a wearers—a robe for Saul; a gold gown for his eldest daughter, Merab; a bloody tunic for David, fresh from the killing of Goliath. Still, it was a treat to hear this early, great example of Handel’s Handel’s foray into the realm of English English oratorio, which balances fine arias with expressive choral writing and some unusual orchestral orchestral choices—the ?Dead March,” for example, pairs timpani timpani and flute, and Saul’s madness madness is heralded by the bell-like sounds of a glockenspiel. Christopher Christopher Dylan Herbert was a properly demented Saul, Jessica Muirhead was fierce as Merab, Marie-Eve Munger contrastingly sweet and warm as her sister, Michal, and Ryland Angel intense intense as their brother, Jonathan, who tries unsuccessfully to temper temper Saul’s rage against David. Members of the choir ably took the smaller roles, most notably Dashon Burton, who brought sinister sinister weight to the Ghost of Samuel and his prophecy of doom. And while it was odd to see Saul strangle Jonathan at the end of Act II (Jonathan actually actually dies defending Saul in the battle with the Philistines in Act III), it made “0 fatal consequence,” consequence,” the chilling chorus that closes Act II—superbly sung here—all the more affecting, as the choir, holding lighted candles, candles, filed out from its distant niche to surround the audience.

Caldwell And Chris Kirkham The state of Washington is suing Motel 6, alleging the low-cost hotel chain repeatedly repeatedly provided detailed information information about guests to immigration immigration authorities for at least two years in violation of a state consumer-protection law. Washington Attorney General General Bob Ferguson said on Wednesday that at least six corporate-owned hotels provided provided U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials daily lists of guests, including their names, driver’s license numbers, dates of birth and room numbers. “The scale of what Motel 6 was doing is deeply disturbing to me,” Mr. Ferguson said. Officials at Motel 6, which is owned by private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, didn’t respond to requests to comment on Wednesday. The chain has said in the past that it instructed hotel operators to refrain from voluntarily and routinely sharing guest information information with federal immigration immigration authorities. Mr. Ferguson said Motel 6 committed more than 9,000 violations of the state’s Consumer Consumer Protection Act for what he described as egregious privacy privacy violations from about Jan. 1, 2015, through September September 2017.

Mr. Trump formed the Presidential Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May and installed Vice President Mike Pence as chairman after blaming voter fraud for his loss in the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The panel was created despite independent experts saying there was no evidence to support his claim of widespread widespread fraud. “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Mr. Trump said in a Twitter message about three weeks after after the election, without providing providing any evidence. He later said he wanted an investigation investigation into whether votes were cast illegally by people voting twice, voters using deceased people’s names, or by undocumented undocumented immigrants.

Developers also raised a number number of significant questions about the proposal, but the letter and a union response offering to meet to discuss the issue open a new round of dialogue between two groups that often have been at odds. Affordable-housing developers have said that employing union workers drives up costs and means that they can build fewer units.

In a letter to union leaders, Jolie Milstein, president and chief executive of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing, said she was writing “to express interest in your offer to accept wages that are 40% lower than normal union pay on affordable-housing projects in certain neighborhoods.” She asked for more details on the proposal. The Aug. 22 letter was addressed addressed to Gary LaBarbera, president president of the Building and Construction Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an umbrella organization of 15 local affiliates of national and international construction unions that operate in the city.

Ms. Milstein also questioned whether the proposed pay cut would apply to benefits, as well as wages.

But the aftershocks of this shake-up could shift the balance of interpretive interpretive power from the art experts to the digerati, with troubling consequences. While their museum was closed for expansion, Chad Coerver, Coerver, SFMOMA’s chief content officer, and Keir Winesmith, head of web and digital platforms, platforms, challenged their Silicon Valley colleagues to help them come up with an exceptionally robust app. Apple’s Core Location Location engineers performed radio-frequency radio-frequency surveys throughout the museum?s 170,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor gallery space, enabling enabling impressive navigational accuracy for the nine multimedia multimedia tours and the audio clips for 209 individual artworks. Detour, a feisty Bay Area startup, helped devise quirky narratives, starring personages not previously known for their art acumen (high-wire artist Philippe Petit and San Francisco Francisco Giants pitching coach Dave “Rags” Righetti, to name two). On the plus side, the digital interventions, available on late-model iPhones or on the museum’s rental devices, work. This is no small accomplishment, accomplishment, given the over-hyped, inadequately inadequately engineered gizmos that I have encountered elsewhere. elsewhere. Would that the contents of SFMOMA?s app were as smart as its technology. Many of the offbeat offbeat audio tours seem geared to those who rarely, if ever, set foot in a museum, underestimating underestimating much of SFMOMA’S SFMOMA’S audi fc ence. The narrators narrators for the app’s audio tours often come off as cool but unschooled—individuals unschooled—individuals with interesting professional professional or personal lives but lacking art smarts. And they tend to be more fatuous than factual, clogging the earbuds with extraneous (occasionally erroneous) details. The apparent explanation is that the curators provided the underlying content but abdicated abdicated their responsibility to closely supervise its use. Gary Garrels, SFMOMA’s senior curator curator of painting and sculpture, admitted to me that he hadn’t even listened to many of the tours’ clips, believing that the app’s developers better understood understood what general audiences want. The tours are not entirely specious. In one titled “I Don’t Get It.? Kumail Nanjiani and Martin Starr, television costars costars on “Silicon Valley,? do eventually “get it,” thanks to SFMOMA assistant curator Caitlin Haskell’s smart answers to very basic questions. But the tour titled “Play by Play” will make devoted art lovers call “foul.” Modeled on sportscasting, sportscasting, it features Bay Area athletic notables like Coach Righetti, who improbably claims to bring his pitchers to SFMOMA to scout out Minimalist Minimalist Dan Flavin, so they can admire how he ?takes an everyday everyday object [fluorescent tubing tubing 1 and makes us see it in a new way. When you’re going through a 162-game season, it’s good to be able to see something something new in what you do!? The disconnect between the narrators’ inventions and the artists’ intentions is particularly particularly jarring in “German to Me.? in which narrator Luisa Beck, a German-American radio radio producer, over-shares her personal history as someone who is “not Jewish,... didn’t lose family members in concentration concentration camps,” and was pleasantly surprised, upon arriving arriving in the U.S., to encounter German staples like hot dogs and sauerkraut.

After describing describing his emotional and spiritual epiphany upon entering entering a room of Rothkos as a young man, Mr. Garrels gets rhapsodic about SFMOMA’s own “No. 14. 1960,? with its “brilliant glow of the orange-red in the top, . . . this the way the brushstrokes are put on. the way it captures space and light—fire but also coolness—really sums up everything everything Rothko achieved in his paintings.” Technology is also used to good advantage in the information-packed information-packed Interpretive Galleries, Galleries, where visitors can rest their feet but exercise their brains by exploring multimedia offerings at an array of touchscreens touchscreens and digital tables. In future iterations, SFMOMA SFMOMA would do well to rely more consistently on its own curators for cogent, pungent audio commentary. Frankly. Green + Webb, a cultural-consultancy cultural-consultancy engaged by SFMOMA to evaluate its Rauschenberg Research Project, says that museum visitors respond best to “specialists—curators, artists artists and others [who are] valued valued for sounding knowledgeable knowledgeable . . for ‘owning’ the information, and being passionate,? passionate,? in the words of its 2014 research report on mobile content.

They salute the contributions contributions of the entire band and don’t rely on Flatt ? Scruggs’s greatest hits to do that, leaning leaning mainly on lesser-known Malfoy forebears. Ms. Rowling is known for being being LGBT-positive when she can be—both girls and boys, we’re told, fall for one Hogwarts stud. But both Scorpius and Albus suffer cringeworthy hetero flirtations.

One person Ms. Schulhof has gotten involved is the fashion publicist Anneliese Peterson. “When you help a charity, you recognize how great it feels and how it’s beyond beyond any monetary job you have,” Ms. Peterson said. “Nothing’s going to bring you more success than giving back to the community.” That said, it?s still harder than it looks to pull off a successful, successful, fancy party, noted Ms. Crespi. ?If we could raise the same amount of money without without having a gala, we would do it,? she said. the occasion, smiling as he explained: ’I can?t say no to Anna.?

Now Mr. Clegg is a literary agent once more (at William Morris, with a roster of young talent) and still Brooks Brothers-handsome Brothers-handsome (?J.

Mr. Clegg spends much of it at the dog park where he met a reporter for an interview, fighting an urge to use again and forming relationships with other recovering recovering addicts. ?It was a period in my life when I was embracing embracing sincerity for the first time,” he said. “Things were going from grey to green.” Compared to ?Portrait,” Mr. Clegg’s life today sounds downright quaint: He spent Easter with his nieces and his boyfriend at a farm.

But the man he was in “Portrait,” “Portrait,” is “never too far away,” and Mr. Clegg relapsed as recently recently as a year and a half ago. “I’m an addict and alcoholic until my last breath,” he said. He credits “daily engagement with recovery”—staying in close contact with and close proximity to other recovering addicts—with his ability to manage the addiction that, at one point, depleted his bank account and dictated his daily life. ?Drinking and using drugs holds no appeal for me today, but if I were in a hotel room on the other side of the world, it might hold appeal for me again,” he said. At the dawn of his 40s, he is also aware that his former habits could yield adverse health effects, though so far they really haven’t. ?I was recently recently diagnosed with a severe allergy to casey, a protein found in dairy products,” he said.

We don’t know the name of the French chef in question; he signed his masterwork, masterwork, ?Nouveau traite de la cuisine” (“New Treatise on Cuisine?), with the pseudonym Menon. That was in 1739. The idea that classical French cuisine—with cuisine—with its richly layered sauces, sculpted garnishes and sometimes architectural architectural presentations—needed to be lightened and simplified is clearly not a new (or nouvelle) one. Nonetheless, when a modern-day version of nouvelle cuisine appeared in France in the mid-1970s, it was seen as revolutionary. Advocating reduced cooking times and the use of fresh seasonal ingredients, its advocates banished strong marinades and sauces thickened with the butterflour butterflour mixture called roux. The movement reanimated tradition-bound French kitchens, then went on to lay the groundwork for every modern Western culinary idiom from the so-called New American Cuisine to (eventually) today’s avant-garde creations of Ferran Adria, Heston Blumenthal and Wylie Dufresne. The cradle of nouvelle cuisine was Fernand Point’s La Pyramide in Vienne, just south of Lyon. The restaurant’s fare wasn’t particularly light or modern, but Point saw the future, and trained and inspired inspired young chefs like Alain Chapel, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, and Paul Bocuse Bocuse in a lighter, simpler style of cooking. cooking. When these men returned to their family restaurants, nouvelle cuisine blossomed. blossomed. Chapel and the Troisgros brothers, brothers, along with such other contemporary-minded contemporary-minded chefs as Michel Guerard, Roger Verge and Raymond Oliver, became became sacred names in the culinary firmament. firmament. The star of the movement, though, was always Paul Bocuse. Mr. Bocuse is a physically imposing man, with a big round head and an aristocrat’s aristocrat’s carriage; he is only about 6 feet tall but is almost always photographed wearing a foot-high toque—the starched, pleated chef’s hat that is a symbol of authority authority in the professional kitchen—that seems to elevate him heavenward. He has a commanding personality, a resonant resonant voice and a famous ego. The food critics Henri Gault and Christian Millau are usually credited with coining the name and codifying the principles of nouvelle cuisine in their Gault/Millau magazine, beginning in 1973. But Mr. BoFICTION BoFICTION CHRONICLE: SAM SACKS In the Wake of‘Cloud Atlas’ SEBASTIAN FAULKS has bound together five distinct but thematif thematif cally related stories spanning 200 years in “A Possible Life” (Henry Holt, 287 pages, $25). It is a trail famously blazed by David Mitchell in 2004 with “Cloud Atlas.” But Mr. Faulks made his bones in historical fiction, fiction, with the Great War novel “Birdsong” “Birdsong” (1993), and has a talent for briskly immersing the reader in the rhythms and images of the past. “A Possible Life” tracks the fortunes of a British soldier coordinating with the French Resistance in World War II; a Dickensian child raised in a workhouse in England in 1859; a devoutly religious nanny and charwoman in 1820s France; and a Joni Mitchell-like folk singer in the 1970s. But the novel’s keystone is a section set in 2029, which follows an Italian neuroscientist, neuroscientist, Elena Duranti. A bookworm from a young age, Elena is responsible for successfully locating the basis of human human consciousness in the brain. It is the most significant scientific discovery since Watson and Crick found the structure structure of DNA, yet the knowledge makes little difference in Elena’s life. She is a staunch rationalist but helplessly in love with a man she can’t have. “Elena admits,” admits,” Mr. Faulks writes, “that after a lifetime of scientific research she understands understands nothing at all.” The motif of these five stories is the sovereignty of indecipherable chance. The workhouse child, whose fate is to fall in love and make a home with two sisters, echoes Elena?s defeatism: ?The more I live the less I seem to understand.” understand.” The stories involve sudden illness illness and blind infatuation. Orphans, whose fates are determined by the whims of others, make regular appearances. appearances. Mr. Faulks is also fond of pointedly pointedly ironic juxtapositions. In the story from the 1850s, for instance, a woman is THE TASTE OF FRANCE Paul Bocuse outside his three-star restaurant L?Auberge du Pont de Collonges in 2011. cuse has always claimed that the term was first used to describe a meal that he and some other chefs created for the maiden flight of the Concorde in 1969.

In 1975 he told the New York Times that ?women lack the instinct for great cooking.? cooking.? Doubtless inspired by this philosophy, philosophy, and by his penchant for practical jokes—as a young cook, he was known to crouch below a table in the kitchen and whitewash the heels of distinguished visitors—he visitors—he once showed up to give an award to a female chef accompanied by a bevy of scantily clad showgirls.

He has also long since ceased being ?relevant? to the world of gastronomy. gastronomy. But he remains enormously respected—an respected—an icon not just in France but in high-level culinary circles world-wide. Last year, the Culinary Institute of America America named him Chef of the Century. All this is far more than you will learn about Mr. Bocuse from his ?The Complete Complete Bocuse,? described by its publisher as “the unequivocal reference tome on the full spectrum of twentieth-century French cooking, interpreted and revised by master chef Paul Bocuse for the home crippled by a stroke but somehow, years later, makes a full recovery; in the Elena section when medicine is so much more advanced, a man dies of a stroke because an ambulance is busy elsewhere. It is intriguing to see how Mr. Faulks seeds his themes in the parallel tales. Nevertheless, “A Possible Life? is nowhere nowhere near as challenging or rococo as the orchestral “Cloud Atlas.” This is a benign gentrification of Mr. Mitchell’s dense book that aims for, and will likely receive, immediate commercial success. Yet one element of it should give readers pause.

Traditionally, novelists novelists have been chary about depicting the camps and crematoria; Holocaust fiction fiction is its own genre, with its own cautious cautious rules. Mr. Faulks amply portrays the horror of these scenes, but his Holocaust Holocaust section is simply a part of his book—in narrative parity with the other parts, even those about folk music— rather than its centerpiece. I found this unsettling, but readers will need to decide decide for themselves. Some will be glad that Mr. Faulks has shrugged off the taboos taboos that surround fictional portrayals of concentration camps to write them like any other historical experience; others others may think it alarming that this singular singular event in human history is so open to being mined for popular fiction.

And he replays his 100th birthday party, where he did celebratory lines of cocaine with his great-great grandson. “Spilt Milk” nimbly arranges this seeming seeming hodgepodge of autobiography in a way that is both funny and illuminating. Euldlio’s deepest memories are of Matilde, the unstable woman who left him shortly after their marriage and whose image has haunted him for over 70 years. “Spilt Milk” is told in monologic monologic chapters—?my death rattles,” Eul4lio Eul4lio calls them—in which Mr. Buarque susoaking?), susoaking?), the nearest thing to a recipe offered here is: “White stock is made with white meat and bones (or poultry) that are boiled with aromatic ingredients and then filtered.” And how long does that baked cod stay in the oven? Paul Bocuse doesn’t want to hold your hand. This Is not to say that “The Complete Bocuse? is of no use. If you?re a reasonably reasonably experienced cook and have the time, ambition and disposable income needed to tackle most of these recipes, you will find much here to reward you. Dishes like Mr. Bocuse’s hot freshwater trout mousse with crayfish coulis are the kind of silly, wonderful, old-style dish—full of eggs, cream and butter (adieu, nouvelle cuisine!)—that helped give French cooking cooking its reputation for elegance and seductive seductive richness in the first place. The famous Troisgros recipe for escalope of salmon with sorrel sauce is here, as is Fernand Point’s fabled gratin of crayfish tails. I’d stay away from the risottos (cooked undisturbed in a covered saucepan saucepan instead of stirred constantly in the Italian manner) and the gazpacho (lacking (lacking the essential bread thickening)—but those aren’t French dishes anyway. If you want to learn how to make classic French onion soup or tournedos in red wine sauce or cherry clafoutis or almost anything else that’s purely Gallic—nouvelle Gallic—nouvelle or traditional or anything in between—you’ll find the formulas here. It will definitely help, though, if you have ?the instinct for good cooking.” Even if you’re a woman. Mr. Andrews is the editorial director of the DailyMeal.com. perbly blends (in a lively translation by Alison Entrekin) the narrator’s growing dementia with his fiercely lucid recall: ?Today she went out without saying where she was going; Matilde’s never been one to venture out alone at night. So, naturally, 1 take off like a madman looking for her, but that’s only going to happen in a while. It’s strange having memories of things that have yet to happen; happen; I’ve just remembered Matilde Is going going to disappear forever.” Embedded in these flashbacks is a sly critique of Brazil?s social and racial mores. mores. In his lifetime Eulalio’s wealth and status have eroded to nothing. His ancestors ancestors were slaveholding aristocracy, now, because of his marriage with “cinnamoncolored” “cinnamoncolored” Matilde, his grandchildren are black. The fall of the once-mighty Assumpgdo Assumpgdo clan gives a complex picture of the changing face of Brazilian democracy. Allow me to add my voice to the chorus chorus of praise that has greeted “The Revised Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving’’ (Algonquin, 278 pages, $23.95), the novel by Jonathan Evison that was released released in the summer but that only recently recently reached my nightstand. It is the story of Ben Benjamin, who is trying at age 39 to crawl back from a tragedy that cost him his family. He is hired as a caregiver caregiver for Trevor, who suffers from muscular muscular dystrophy and, at 20 years old, seems to be ?aging in reverse.” What results Ls an unlikely buddy story between a character who is physically disabled and one who is psychologically battered (?In my own way I’m every bit as crippled,” Ben notes). Mr. Evison is a dab hand at a kind of beer-and-pizza realism realism that keeps this spiky friendship from sinking into sentimentality. Ben’s attempts attempts to get back into dating are grimly hilarious, and the novel culminates with a classic road trip across the American West. Mr. Evison injects a wonderful amount of feeling into those empty highways highways and dingy rest stops. Martin Amis Continued from page C5 will turn out to be the murderer. Yet the postmodern elements of the novel fade in the memory; just as John Self dominates dominates “Money,” it is Keith Talent who stays in the mind after reading “London Fields.” It is not the meek but men like him, Mr. Amis suggests, who are going to inherit a polluted earth. Probably the last book Mr. Amis wrote that contributed substantially to his reputation was “The Information,” his 1995 novel about a rivalry between two novelists. But the very fact that Mr. Amis, entering what should have been his peak years as a writer, chose to write a satire about the literary life struck some readers at the time as a bad omen. Indeed, doubts about Mr. Amis’s depth and seriousness have been a recurring feature of his career and only increased with his efforts to dispel them in a series of portentous and ill-conceived books devoted to capital-I Issues. Early in his career, Mr. Amis stood out from the New Statesman group: He was fundamentally indifferent to politics. politics. But in the 1980s he began to interest interest himself in the subject of nuclear weapons and in ?Einstein’s Monsters” (1987) wrote about them with an offputting offputting simple-mindedness and sentimentality. sentimentality. Mr. Bradford quotes his reflection reflection that, if he were to survive a nuclear attack, ?then—God willing, if I still have the strength, and, of course, if they are still alive—I must find my wife and children and I must kill them.” This self-regarding bathos more than justifies justifies the novelist Will Self’s reproach that Mr. Amis has ?the desire of the tragic farceur to be taken seriously.? Amis’s celebrity has long increased without reference to the critical consensus about his books. The same false note is struck again in “Experience.” when Mr. Amis tries to suggest, in a way that can’t help seeming seeming egotistical, that the murder of his cousin Lucy Partington by the British serial killer Fred West was the defining event of his own life. It returns, still more discordant, in the dreadful ?Koba the Dread” (2002), in which Mr. Amis muses on the discovery, apparently new to him, that Stalin really was quite a bad man after all. Typical of the book is the passage where Mr. Amis rebukes himself for giving his screaming infant daughter the nickname “Butyrki,” after one of the worst Stalinist prisons. That he could make light of Soviet terror in this way, as he wouldn’t Nazi terrorimpossible terrorimpossible to give your daughter the nickname Dachau—is meant to say something about the West’s lack of seriousness about communism. In fact, the point it makes is that Mr. Amis himself has done something in execrable taste. The simultaneous decline of Mr. Amis’s fictional powers and inflation of his moral pretensions has meant that, for the past decade at least, no writer has been a more tempting target for critics. ?Insulting Amis has become a competitive sport among book reviewers” reviewers” observed Sam Anderson in 2007, before going on to describe his story of love in a Gulag, ?House of Meetings,? as “like notes for a great novel to be written written by somebody else.” James Wolcott greeted ?Lionel Asbo” with the suggestion suggestion that Amis “might be better off if he gave up writing novels and just granted interviews from now on.” The weakness of this latest novel is especially telling, since its basic premise—a premise—a thuggish lout wins the lottery and is able to indulge his vulgar appetites appetites on the grandest scale—might once have provoked Mr. Amis to grand flights of inventive disgust. Yet it is hard not to feel that Mr. Amis is aiming at the same targets he already knocked down when writing about Keith Talent—the Talent—the proletarian non-culture of tabloids tabloids and alcohol and violence, the old moronic inferno. Only this time his treatment of it feels listless and schematic, schematic, with nothing to match the inventive inventive prose of Mr. Amis at his 1980s best. In his 60s, he is writing with mere disdain about a kind of yobbishness that once could provoke him to a sublime sublime dread, and a perverse eagerness. The last chapter of Mr. Bradford’s biography biography is titled ?Significance: Is He a Great Writer?” and concludes tepidly that ?we should reserve judgment on ‘greatness.’... We will see.” There is, of course, nothing blameworthy about not being a great writer. But Mr. Amis?s celebrity celebrity has long increased without reference reference to the critical consensus about his books. His case suggests that when the balance between reputation and achievement achievement gets out of whack, retribution is inevitable—and not too pleasant.

Now a new subway is set to complete the gentrification of Aberdeen, home to Hong Kong’s fishing fleet and once famous for boat people living on junks. Aberdeen, whose factory buildings date back to when Hong Kong was a manufacturing hub, is an example of how rents in Hong Kong’s higher-priced areas, areas, such as Central and Causeway Causeway Bay, have driven tenants to look elsewhere. Interest in the area also has been growing among developers and investors. Sale prices of commercial space in the Aberdeen Aberdeen industrial hub of Wong Chuk Hang already have skyrocketed skyrocketed from HKS600 ($77) a square foot in 2007 to about $6,000 ($770) a square foot.

A new subway is set to complete Aberdeen?s gentrification. Named in memory of a former U.K. prime minister, Aberdeen, on the southern end of Hong Kong island, is home to 80,000 people. It mimics the income gap of Hong Kong itself, with industrial buildings, buildings, public housing and senior homes vying for space with a premier yacht club and two leading leading international schools. Villas in nearby Shouson Hill sell for HK$100 million (around $13 million) million) or more. The distance, 20 minutes by car from the Central business district, can be off-putting for many Hong Kong residents. But artists and entrepreneurs have moved here in the past three years because it is still possible to find bargains, even with recent recent price increases. “Space is a luxury in Hong Kong,” said William Lane, founder and artistic director for Hong Hong Kong New Musk Ensemble, top, moved into the Blue Box factory building, bottom, whkh has begun to lease space to artistk groups even though it still is used mostly for industrial purposes.

The music ensemble moved into the Blue Box factory building, building, which has begun to lease space to artistic groups even though it still is used mostly for industrial purposes. According to Prime Property, which leases and sells commercial commercial properties in Hong Kong, space in the Blue Box building rents for HK$9 ($1.15) a square foot a month, while the rent in One International Financial Center Center in Central is HK$160 ($20.50) a square foot. But Aberdeen’s appeal is about more than cheap rent. The old factory buildings may look deserted and run-down on the outside, but their high ceilings, big windows and open floor plans give them character, occupants occupants say. The cool factor has attracted people like Tingting Zhong, chairman at Red Earth Cosmetics. Cosmetics. The former private-equity executive and banker used to call herself a “Central girl,” but now she enjoys working in One Island South, an office-shopping complex where her neighbors include include fellow entrepreneurs, designers designers and the offices of highend highend Hong Kong department store Lane Crawford. “It feels like you are in SoHo” in New York, said Ms. Zhong, who lunches in the vegetarian restaurant downstairs or at one of the local noodle joints nearby. Aberdeen is popular with other former finance professionals professionals as well. After Chance Xie quit her job as a private banker to start a travel company called Journeys by Chance, she rented a studio office there for about HK$18,000 ($2,300) a month, while the same space in central Hong Kong would cost twice as much. She now has green vistas and enough room for a piano and weekend movie parties. Commercial-property rent in Aberdeen has been rising in the past year while rent in Central has been falling. But the gap is still large enough that tenants are making the move. Ms. Xie even thinks about moving to an Aberdeen apartment. apartment.

But as more trendy businesses businesses move into the area, people people may be priced out. Some worry that Aberdeen’s newfound popularity will mean some of its charm will be lost. Baldwin Ko, owner of highend highend gelato and pastry brand 2/3 Dolci, has mixed feelings about the new subway line. “As a landlord, landlord, I would hope that prices will keep going up,” said Mr. Ko, who as an owner of a floor in an industrial building has profited handsomely from Aberdeen’s rising rising popularity. “But as a retailer, you need to find affordable rent, and I hope this area can keep its multidimensional feeling.” cushmanwakefield.com LEADING THE WAY Cushman ?

In 1989, Jersey City became the first of four urban districts to be taken over under a new state law allowing such intervention intervention in dysfunctional systems. systems. At the time, state officials officials said the district was so rife with nepotism, patronage and academic problems that children were deprived of their right to an education. The New Jersey Board of Education passed a resolution Wednesday saying the district had made enough progress in improving its instruction that state intervention could be withdrawn. The district’s fouryear fouryear graduation rate rose to 75% last year, up from 67% three years before. Even so, Jersey City lags far behind the state’s 90% graduation rate last year, and test scores in many of the city’s schools remain remain low.

Twist for Two Boots Founders By Jonathan Randles A townhouse in Manhattan’s Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood neighborhood that is co-owned by the estranged founders of Two Boots, a New York City chain of quirky pizzerias, is being shopped in bankruptcy to pay off more than $5 million in debt as the restaurant grows beyond its roots in the area. The five-story, 8,500-squarefoot 8,500-squarefoot residence, currently in chapter 11, has been the object of a court fight between former partners Phil Hartman and Doris Doris Kornish, who filed for divorce divorce in 2005. Her ownership interest in Two Boots was transferred to Mr. Hartman in the divorce, according to a 2008 court order. Real-estate broker Warburg Realty said it intends to list the property for $10 million. Two Boots isn’t directly affected affected by the bankruptcy, and Mr. Hartman said sales have been strong. Some business debt is attached to the property, including a loan taken out in 2013 that with fees and interest has increased to $2.3 million.

Some community community groups hold rallies and protests. In a neighborhood in Midtown known as Sutton Place, the East River 50s Alliance, Alliance, filed an application for a zoning change to ban tall towers towers in a 10-square block area. It called the effort “an unprecedented unprecedented citizens’ application.” The alliance’s leaders say the group has spent more than $1 million since 2015 on lawyers, lawyers, planners and environmental environmental consultants to move their application through the city’s review process. The local Community Board unanimously voted for it, and last week, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, who had already signed on as coapplicant, coapplicant, formally approved it. The application is headed for a hearing at the City Planning Planning Commission followed by a vote later this summer. Many of the movement’s leaders live across the street from the new tower, in a massive massive 485-foot tall co-op known as the Sovereign, where some views would be blocked by the new building. “We are going to take this to the finish line because we believe that building it right is crucial for our community,” said Lisa Mercuric, a member of the alliance board. She lives lease for a Baltimore outlet that closed this year. The townhouse is around the corner from the first Two Boots pizzeria that opened 30 years ago on Avenue A and, coincidentally, is likely to be sold at an important moment for the family-owned business. Two Boots is talking with potential potential partners about the possibility possibility of providing operational operational expertise and investing new capital to grow a business that has more than a dozen outlets, Mr. Hartman said. “The company has grown about as far as an indie-filmmaker-turned-entrepreneur indie-filmmaker-turned-entrepreneur can take it,” he said. Two Boots has faced challenges challenges following the loss in 2016 of a busy spot in Grand Central and major source of revenue it had operated for 16 years, Mr. Hartman said. To make up for the loss, Two Boots moved to another location location nearby.

The plan would cap new building heights at between 210 and 260 feet in a 10-block area in Midtown, east of First Avenue. To reach 260 feet in height, developers would have to include affordable housing in their projects. Also listed as co-applicants are two Manhattan council members, Ben Kallos and Daniel Daniel Garodnick, as well as state Senator Liz Krueger. The developer, Gamma Real Estate, is racing to complete work on the foundation of the new tower, known as Sutton 58, on East 58th Street near Sutton Place. Once a foundation foundation is substantially complete the old zoning would apply. The slender building will be 62 stories on a 60-foot wide lot that will cantilever 10 feet over a low-rise apartment building next door. The building building permit lists the height at 799 feet, but a zoning diagram shows the top of the roof above a floor of mechanicals at 856 feet. Under current rules, the tower developers are receiving a zoning bonus by agreeing to pay more than $24 million toward toward affordable housing at another another East Side site. Jonathan Kalikow, president of Gamma Real Estate, said the zoning application was an illegal attempt to “spot zone” the Sutton 58 project. He said the alliance was “seeking to protect the window views of its members.? “At every step, this application application has been wholly driven by the desire of these residents to preserve views, not to benefit benefit their community,” he said.

Since then, as other towers have sprung up and the neighborhood neighborhood has become known as billionaire?s row, alarms have been raised about the slender shadows these building may cast over Central Park.

The Municipal Art Society, a civic group, wants new rules and writer Tess Stahl, who described described the arrival of Two Boots as a forerunner to the gentrification gentrification of the East Village. “In many ways, Two Boots is one of the last remnants of the old neighborhood,” she said. Referring to how the neighborhood neighborhood has changed, Warburg Realty said in a price assessment assessment filed in the bankruptcy court: The townhouse likely would attract an investor who can turn the home into multiple multiple rental units. The property was valued by the New York Department of Taxation in 2015 at $14.1 million, according according to court documents. The sale likely would force out Ms. Kornish, who continued continued living in the townhouse following the divorce. An overseer overseer for the property who was appointed by a judge took legal action in June to remove her from the residence, which initially initially was to be sold in 2012.

Her group is supporting the East River 50s Alliance. ?They have done something which is really unusual and kind of amazing,” she said.

336,2430679143,"OPINION REVIEW & OUTLOOK The Second Wave Covid Scare S tocks sold off Thursday amid investor worries that a “second wave” of coronavirus coronavirus infections could cause countries and states that are reopening to lock down again. But headlines about a coronavirus resurgence in the U.S. are overblown so far, and the bigger threat is keeping the economy in a coma. “We know as a fact that reopening reopening other states we’re seeing significant problems,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. “Twelve states that reopened are now seeing spikes. This is a very real possibility.” This is Mr. Cuomo’s excuse for keeping New York City in lockdown purgatory for 12 weeks as other states reopen and their economies rebound. * * * Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. About a quarter of the new cases are in counties with large prisons and meatpacking plants that were never forced to shut down. Tests have increased by about 37% in Florida in two weeks, but confirmed cases have risen 28%. Cases were rising at a faster clip during the last two weeks of April (47%) when much of the state remained locked down. Now restaurants, malls, barbershops and gyms are open if they follow social-distancing guidelines. In Arizona, cases have increased by 73% in the last two weeks though tests have increased by just 53%. But a quarter of all cases in the state are on Indian reservations, which have especially high-risk populations. The rate of diabetes is twice as high among Native Americans as whites and the rate of obesity is 50% higher. Liberals and the media demanded more testing testing before states could reopen, yet now are criticizing criticizing states because more testing has turned up more cases. Keep in mind that New York has reported about the same number of new cases in the last two weeks as Florida, though it ramped up testing earlier so the relative increase increase appears less significant. A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn’t changed since late April.

Someone needs to rein in the ICC and it might as well be Washington. The order allows the Justice, State and Treasury Treasury departments to impose financial sanctions or travel bans on any ICC officials who attempt to prosecute Americans. It expands on a previous round of travel restrictions on some ICC officials introduced last year. The immediate goal is to block an investigation the ICC started in 2017 into supposed war crimes in Afghanistan. That investigation is both vexatious and silly. U.S. officials officials accused of crimes already are subject to American law, while the ICC somehow thinks the Taliban will care if officials in the Hague prosecute prosecute the terrorists for genocide.

Mr. Abbott started reopening six weeks ago while Mr. Cuomo began letting manufacturing manufacturing and construction resume in the Big Apple this week. Fatalities are a lagging epidemic indicator since most people who die have been in the hospital hospital for two to three weeks. But deaths also aren’t surging. Texas has recorded 151 deaths this past week versus 221 in the last week of April. Florida has reported 239 deaths, 72 fewer than in the last week of April. Deaths are probably declining in part from better and earlier treatment, but this means there’s less to fear from reopening. While Arizona Arizona has reported 114 deaths—43 more than in the last week of April—its deaths per capita are similar to the 325 that New York has reported in the past week. Mr. Cuomo over the weekend boasted that New York “did the impossible” and “crushed” the coronavirus curve. New York has made enormous enormous progress since the early days of the pandemic, pandemic, which hit the state harder and earlier because because of its population density, mass transit and international travel. We aren’t among the revisionists revisionists who say Mr. Cuomo should have locked down New York earlier. But other states that didn’t impose strict lockdowns and have been gradually reopening have kept the epidemic under control and not paid as high an economic price.

A more reasonable demand would be to confine the duties of police (“Wave of Protests Fuels Moves to Shift Funding From Police,” Police,” Page One, June 8). The police were conceived to protect the lawabiding lawabiding from criminals, period. Due to decades of shortsighted political decisions, the police have been subjected subjected to endless mission creep. They are expected to deal with homelessness, drug addiction, mental mental health, child welfare, family dysfunction, dysfunction, poverty and, in some cities, cities, even suppress dissent. These were never appropriate for the policeman’s policeman’s duties. Society, as a whole, refused to deal with social problems and told the police to “deal with it.” As a result, the limited limited tools of law enforcement were visited on social problems. Some of the overfunding of the police departments departments should be redistributed to social and mental health, most of us can agree. We must fund agencies and personnel to deal with nonpolice matters such as the homeless, nonviolent addicts and the insane. Adequate funding of these needs will require more money than can be safely extracted from police budgets, so expect taxes to reflect it. Robert N.

According to Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail group at Douglas Klliman Real Estate, excitement is coming mostly from new “destination” developments. The focus is still on Manhattan, but all five boroughs are attracting developers’ attention, thanks mostly to zoning changes that will permit more density. “Brookfield Place is doing gangbusters and Westfield at the World Trade Center may be the most anticipated opening yet,” she says. “The opening of the $4 billion Oculus PATH station at WTC this spring will bring more consumers to these Downtown destinations.

342,1940553827,"U.S. NEWS Single-Pilot Cockpit Idea Floated in Study One Aviator Would Stay on Ground to Assist at Busy Times By Jon Ostrowkr And Andy Pasztor Facing potential shortages of airline pilots and dramatic advances advances in automation, industry and government researchers have begun the most serious look yet at the idea of enabling jetliners to be flown by a single pilot. All large commercial jets for passenger and cargo service world wide now fly with at least two pilots in the cockpit. A new study by the National Aeronautics Aeronautics and Space Administration Administration and Rockwell Collins Inc. will focus on the provocative idea that co-pilots could remain on the ground, remotely assisting assisting solo aviators on the flight deck during the busiest parts of flights, said John Borghese, Rockwell?s vice president of its Advanced Technology Center. Whether the concept will eventually come to fruition depends depends on political viability and social acceptability as well as technical feasibility. The researchers researchers aren’t endorsing the idea or devising specific plans for single-pilot operation of large commercial jets. Rather, they seek to analyze changes in technology and operations that Reducing the size of cockpit crews—or eventually even eliminating pilots entirely—has been a topic of discussion for years. could make the concpt feasible in the future—evn if that means as far off as2030. From self-operatiig elevators introduced well ove a half-century half-century ago to advanc?d plans for driverless cars tolay, human mobility has becone increasingly increasingly automated. The NASA study reflects not only technological technological ambition but more practical practical concerns: Many airline industry industry officials are worried that the world wide pool of pilots will dwindle over the next two decades while air-travel volume doubles. Reducing the size of cockpit crews for big cargo or passenger passenger planes—or eventually perhaps perhaps even eliminating pilots entirely—have entirely—have been topics of theoretical discussion among aerospace industry officials and researchers for many years. The NASA initiative is significant because it raises the concept’s profile, and signals that NASA Leaders Say Protests Not Over By Kris Hudson Organizers and participants in weekend protests nationwide of police treatment of minorities say the movement is evolving to include more lobbying for legislative legislative and political change. Demonstrations drew thousands, thousands, and at times teas of thousands, thousands, of participants in New York, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Baltimore, the San Francisco Bay Area and San Antonio, among other cities, on Saturday. Leaders said more cities are likely to host protests, and activists activists in some—such as Ferguson, Mo., where the first demonstrations demonstrations erupted in August after a fatal police shooting of an un armed African-American teenare teenare brainstorming campaigns to unseat incumbent politicians and push for changes in the law. As far as legislation, some want more monitoring of police conduct, such as implementing the use of cameras on officers’ uniforms or in their cruisers. Others, including the Rev. A1 Sharpton’s National Action Action Network, want state attorneys general to oversee cases of alleged police brutality rather than local district attorney offices. Rev. Sharpton said Sunday that his group and others would meet Tuesday to plan a national protest in which participants would march on state capitols within “days not months.” The National Action Network organized organized some of last weekend’s protests, along with the National Urban League. National Associaofficials Associaofficials are convinced the general general notion isn’t too far-fetched to merit further research. The roughly $4 million, fouryear fouryear contract was awarded to Rockwell earlier this year but the first phase will be announced announced on Tuesday. The nearly half-decade study will include running simulations, determining determining where technology is needed and even potentially undertaking undertaking live flight trials. NASA officials officials say they anticipate Rockwell’s Rockwell’s efforts will spark additional studies by an array of other companies and experts. Under the concept the researchers researchers are studying, aviators on the ground could be assigned to assist solo cockpit pilots on multiple flights, virtually co-piloting co-piloting during the busiest times through crowded airspace, approach-and-landing approach-and-landing maneuvers, or if something goes wrong. “It’s a reasonably new area? to study how the notion may apply to large jets, according to Parimal Parimal Kopardekar, the program’s manager based at NASA’s Ames Research Center in northern California. When pilots need a midair rest or bathroom break, those on the ground even may “need to baby-sit the vehicle,” he said. Such a dramatic shift won’t happen any time soon, and there is virtual consensus that reduced crews for passenger planes won’t be considered until they are introduced first in the cargo arena. That is unlikely to gain traction much before the end of the next decade, according according to experts and airline officials. officials. Jets today are designed to have two pilots behind the controls, controls, and retrofitting existing aircraft “may be too expensive and may be too difficult” to obtain obtain regulatory approval, according according to NASA’s Mr. Kopardekar.

Racial tensions have flared into sometimes violent protests across the nation in recent global standard for cockpit behavior behavior and cooperation. Early investigations of single-pilot single-pilot flying alone in a simulator simulator with a co-pilot assisting from a virtual ground station found that separation led to frequent frequent confusion about what the other aviator was doing. Boeing Co. and Airbus Group NV designed jets in the 1970s with increasing automation that eliminated a third crew member, member, who used to be responsible for monitoring navigation and the various aircraft systems. Steady advances in cockpit automation and enhanced capabilities capabilities of unmanned aircraft have transformed the technologies technologies required for reduced-pilot airline operations. “Fundamentally, “Fundamentally, it’s not an engineering question anymore,’’ according to Richard Healing, a former member member of the National Transportation Transportation Safety Board. “The real debate debate is over how regulators and public opinion will react to previously previously unthinkable changes.? The early industry discussion was aimed at cutting costs, but Rockwell’s latest study is partly inspired by an anticipated shortage of pilots. Boeing projects projects a need for 533,000 new commercial airline pilots over the next 20 years as the number of miles flown doubles, and the plane maker has warned that personnel availability might fall short. Analysts, labor groups and academics contend any pilot shortage results from the industry’s industry’s unwillingness to sufficiently sufficiently pay pilots. Boeing declined declined to comment on the NASA „ study with Rockwell. While experts almost univer? univer? sally believe some moves in this direction are inevitable, they disagree over how long they may take and the extent of the stumbling blocks. “This is not an incremental change,? said David Woods, a professor of cognitive systems and resilience engineering at Ohio State University. Reducing crews goes beyond bolting on technology and further automating automating flight decks, he stressed. “This is a major step change. It has big implications for how we train pilots.? Prof. Woods said as flying becomes more automated, transitioning transitioning from routine flying to dealing with potential emergencies emergencies in the air and on the ground becomes increasingly difficult. Experts say these challenges may be surmountable, but not without significantly rethinking current design principles. The worst-case-scenario of pilot incapacitation incapacitation in stormy weather or because of a medical emergency, emergency, for instance, offers a daunting challenge. “You need to have a very assured assured way of getting that aircraft aircraft down to the ground with no help from the pilot on board,” said Mr. Borghese. “Right now I cannot imagine a harder problem.” months after the Aug. 9 deadly shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson.

Mr. Marcano said. ?By and large, you’ll continue to see this type of momentum and renewed renewed discussion.” Rep. A1 Green (D., Texas), addressing addressing protesters in front of the U.S. Capitol on Saturday, outlined a series of bills he would like to see advance through Congress to “make law enforcement more accountable accountable and transparent.” Among the pieces of legislation legislation he mentioned was a bill that would provide state and local law-enforcement agencies with money to buy body cameras. Several members of the crowd suggested that wouldn’t be effective effective enough. “We had a camera,” some shouted, referring to the fact that the choking death of Mr. Garner was captured on video, and still didn’t provide the grand jury with enough evidence to indict the officer. —Rebecca Rallhaus contributed to this article.
