195,1932649420,"Study of Census Results Finds That Residential Segregation Is Down Sharply By SAM ROBERTS More than 40 years after the federal government enacted fairhousing fairhousing legislation and the Great Migration of blacks from the South began to ebb, residential segregation in metropolitan America has been significantly curtailed, according to a study released released Monday. The study of census results from thousands of neighborhoods by two economics professors who are fellows at the Manhattan Institute, Institute, a conservative research organization, found that the nation’s nation’s cities are more racially integrated integrated than at any time since 1910; that all-white enclaves “are effectively extinct?; and that while black urban ghettos still exist, exist, they are shriveling. An influx of immigrants and the gentrification of black neighborhoods neighborhoods contributed to the change, the study said, but suburbanization suburbanization by blacks was even more instrumental. The progress was less pronounced pronounced between blacks and non-Hispanic whites, though, than it has been between blacks and nonblacks, including Asians and Hispanic people. The findings by the two professors professors — Edward Glaeser of Harvard Harvard and Jacob L. Vigdor of Duke — were generally seconded by a spectrum of other experts with several caveats and an admonition admonition that the study should not be seen as declaring the end of all segregation. Also, barriers like exclusionary zoning in the suburbs persist, and the decline in busing to achieve racial integration means that some public schools are more segregated than before. “There is now very much more black-white neighborhood integration integration than 40 years ago,” said Professor Reynolds Farley of the University of Michigan?s Population Population Studies Center. “Those of us who worked on segregation in the 1960s never anticipated such declines. Nevertheless, blacks remain remain considerably more segregated segregated from whites than do Hispames Hispames or Asians.? Douglas Massey, a Princeton sociologist, said: ?In terms of trends in black-white segregation. segregation. we really see two trends: in metro areas with small black populations, we indeed observed sharp decreases in segregation; but in those with large black populations, populations, the declines are much slower and at times nonexistent. Although all-white neighborhoods neighborhoods have largely disappeared, this is more due to the entry of Latinos and Asians into formerly all-white neighborhoods.? William H. Frey, the chief demographer demographer at the Brookings Institution.

Unit 2 at Byron Generating Station Station shut down about 10:20 a.m., after losing power from an off-site source, Exelon officials said. Diesel Diesel generators began supplying power to the plant equipment and operators began releasing steam from the nonnuclear side of the plant to help cool the reactor, officials officials said. The stea.n contains low levels of radioactive tritium, hut the levels are safe for workers and the public, federal and plant officials officials said. An Exelon spokesman said the company did not yet know the reason for the power loss. (AP) NEW ENGLAND Massachusetts: Kennedys Transfer Hyannis Home The Kennedy family transferred ownership of the main home in their compound in Hyannis Port. Mass., to the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate on Monday. The institute will use the 9,055-square-foot waterfront waterfront home for educational seminars and will create a plan to allow limited visits by the public, according to a statement. The Kennedy family, which still owns other homes in the compound, will continue to use the property on a limited basis. Senator Edward M.

John R.

We are far from the “end of segregation.?? Still, Professors Glaeser and Vigdor found that only 20 percent of blacks now live in “ghetto” neighborhoods where 80 percent of the population or more is black, compared with nearly 50 percent who lived in similar neighborhoods a half-century ago.

Nonetheless, 17 census tracts that encompassed encompassed 46,000 Washington residents residents and were more than 98 percent percent black in 2000 were still more than 95 percent black in 2010. The study?s definition of neighborhood neighborhood was borrowed from the census: a tract that is home to 1,500 to 7,500 people.

By those measures, the average average black person still lives in metropolitan housing markets where to achieve complete integration integration more than half the black population would have to move and in neighborhoods where bjacks exceed their share of the region’s population by about 30 percentage points. Many of the cities with less segregation — or cities that demonstrated demonstrated disproportionate gams in integration — are in the Sun Belt, where population growth has been greatest and immigrants immigrants have congregated. Those gains are attributable, in par to the proliferation of subprime mortgages and are threatened by the foreclosure crisis. By the dissimilarity index, Dallas Dallas and Houston are the least segregated segregated big cities. Los Angeles fared best on the isolation index. Sun Belt cities accounted for fully half of the 10 metropolitan areas with the largest black populations populations in 2010, compared with only two in 1970. That helps explain why the dissimilarity index plunged nearly 40 points in metropolitan metropolitan Dallas but less than 10 points (nearly half of that since 2000) in New York. Among cities with the largest black population, Chicago, Cleveland, Cleveland, Detroit and St. Louis ranked highest in the dissimilarity index.

The employee, Carlos Montoya, Montoya, 54, entered his plea in Federal Federal District Court in Manhattan less than a month after his arrest in a continuing investigation of what the authorities have said was a $1 million fraud and bribery bribery scheme involving corrupt As Neighborhood Thrives, No Warm Welcome for a Reopened Jail By LI/ ROBBINS When the Brooklyn House of Detention reopens next week after after being closed since 2003, it may be the only city jail in America America located down the block from a Barneys Co-op and a Rader Joe’s. The building, a 1950s gray behemoth behemoth with screens covering its metal-framed windows, looms incongruously incongruously over one full block of Atlantic Avenue and rejoins a greatly changed neighborhood. During the jail’s vacant period, six high-rise apartment buildings were constructed nearby. One boutique hotel now sits directly across from it on Smith Street, and 14 sleek, six-year-old, modern modern town houses sit next to handsome handsome brownstones, just steps from an entryway covered in barbed w-ire where prisoners are unloaded when they arrive. Some nearby residents in the Boerum Hill neighborhood expressed expressed concerns about safety, while others, in typical New York fashion, worried about parking. “The issue isn’t that there are prisoners; it’s that they will have visitors — and all of a sudden that could bring more foot traffic and crime,” said Lisa Goldfarb, w-ho lives in one of the modern State Street town houses w’ith her husband, Jack DeHovitz. She said their four children walked by the jail to get to school every day. “I never would have agreed to buy this house for all this money had I known it was opening,? she added, saying that real estate agents told her the jail was going to be converted into condominiums. condominiums. The couple paid S3.4 million for the town house in July. “We took a gamble and lost on this neighborhood.? But there had always been speculation that the city would eventually reopen the jail, which was closed as the inmate population population decreased. A 2009 lawsuit, led by William C. Thompson Jr., the comptroller, blocked the city from doubling the building’s size and the number of inmates it could house. In August 2010. the Department Department of Correction announced that because it was shutting down crumbling buildings at Rikers Rikers Island, it planned to reopen the 759-bed Brooklyn complex. The timing did not become official official until December. “I can say that while people are disappointed, I’ve had concern, not any hysteria, and more curiosity,? curiosity,? said Howard Kolins, the president of the Boerum Hill Association, Association, a neighborhood group.

Walter Nin, the warden, told reporters during a tour on Friday. “As a commanding commanding officer of this facility, my primary primary concern is the safety and security of all uniformed staff, all civilians and inmates.? Mr. Nin said the overwhelming concern in the community was not security, but parking, since many spots were reserved for official official vehicles. Mr. Nin said that no new parking placards would be issued and that all 544 employees employees assigned to the jail were advised advised to take public transportation. transportation.

Because those prisoners are no longer coming from Rikers, this will reduce bus traffic, officials say. The average stay will be 56 days. Prisoners are escorted from the complex to and from Brooklyn Criminal Court through an underground tunnel. A visitors’ center that was built m 2003 will accommodate visitors Wednesdays through Sundays, with an entrance on Boerum Place. On Friday, the prison bars smelled of fresh paint (the work was done by inmates) and freshly freshly waxed floors. A cafeteria on the third floor will serve 3,000 ?heart healthy? meals a day. The rooftop recreation area will be reopened reopened and will be visible from the surrounding high rises. “I obviously do not want it,? said Heather Dadourian, pushing her 18-month-old son in a stroller outside the Atlantic Avenue Y.M.C.A. “I guess we have to embrace embrace it at this point, but it?s going going to limit the gentrification of that area.?

Man Admits To Selling Pesticides Ruled Illegal By COLIN MOYNIHAN A man charged with distributing distributing illegal and potentially lethal Chinese pesticides like “The Cat Be Unemployed” — apparently a reference to the poison’s rodentkilling rodentkilling ability — pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors on Friday. The man, Jia Ping Chen, admitted admitted that he sold at least 2,000 packets of a cockroach killer called Mie Zhang Qing that was not registered with the Environmental Environmental Protection Agency.

tenement at 219 Mott Street Almost from the beginning of his career conflicts with his ten ants caught the public s eye Mr Shaoul's name first hit the papers in 2001, after he bought nearby Elizabeth Street tenement While renovating the building he sued several of its rent-regulated Lati no and Chinese tenants accusing them of running rooming houses out of their apartments Other tenants said that he had harassed them in an effort to make them leave and that he turned off the building s gas for four months Mr Shaoul also sued the Commit tee Against Anti-Asian Violence for 20 million for severe emo- tional distress after it organized protests against him and in turn dozen tenants brought three suits of their own against him in housing court The suits were   eventually settled after Mr Shaoul made repairs and re stored the gas was very very young Mr Shaoul said recently wish we had not filed lawsuit against them wish we had handled things differently The tenants were in the wrong for the situa tion they created for themselves That being said they were living there Mr Shaoul declined to reveal how many properties he owns throughout the city but an East Village tenant s association esti mated he has some 40 in that neighborhood alone scattered from East Second to East 13th Street and Second Avenue to Av enue The buildings include portfolio of 17 buildings that he purchased as part of

2416,1932689947,"Robert W. Castle Jr., 83, Outspoken Harlem Priest, Dies By MARGAMT FOX The Rev. Robert W. Castle Jr., an outspoken Episcopal priest in Harlem who was the subject of Jonathan Demme’s acclaimed 1992 documentary, “Cousin Bobby” Bobby” — and who went on to a film acting career as a result — died on Oct. 27 at his home in Holland, Vt. He was 83. The death, of natural causes, was confirmed by his family. Father Castle, who really was Mr. Demme?s cousin, was the rector rector of St. Mary?s Episcopal Church, a largely black and Hispanic Hispanic congregation on West 126th Street, near Broadway, from 1987 until his retirement in 2000. There, he ran an energetic ministry ministry in which spirituality and social social action were indissolubly linked, relishing his role as “an obdurate whirligig fulminating against the establishment,? as N. R. Kleinfield wrote in The New York Times in 1996. Mr. Demme, the Oscar-winning Oscar-winning director of “The Silence of the Lambs” and other feature films, had been out of touch with his cousin for decades. In the late 1980s. he read a newspaper article article describing Father Castle’s practice of plastering irate notices notices on the windshields of cars that were parked illegally on the church sidewalk, blocking congregants’ congregants’ access. That the vehicles in question were police cars from the local precinct did not deter Father Castle Castle in the least. Could this genteelly combustible, combustible, professorially rumpled priest, Mr Demme wondered, be his long-lost cousin Bobby Castle, a former star athlete 15 years his senior? ”1 thought: ‘Good Lord.

Professor McCraw. who taught from 1976 to 2007 at Harvard Business School, won the Pulitzer for history in 1985 for ?Prophets ot Regulation: Charles Francis Adams, Louis D. Brandeis. James M. Landis and Alfred E. Kahn.? The book focused on those men, of different eras, to illustrate how government regulation of industry industry affected the American economy economy from the late 19th to the late 20th centuries. Adams was president of the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1880s; Brandeis, the lawyer and Supreme Court justice, worked to curb the power of banks and corporations corporations in the late 19th and early early 20th centuries, Landis was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Depression, and Kahn was chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, which deregulated airline fares in 1978.

Jones, who succeeded Professor McCraw as the Isidor Straus Professor of Business History History at Harvard. “You hear about personal lives, motivations, but he manages to deal with issues, like regulation, that are usually left to drv textbooks. That was his real gift.? Thomas Kincaid McCraw was born on Sept. 11, 1940, in Corinth, Miss., near where his father. John, a civil engineer for the Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority, was helping to build a dam. The family family moved frequently, and Thomas Thomas graduated from high school in Florence, Ala.

In Jersey City, lobbying for cleaner, safer streets, he once dumped vanloads vanloads of garbage outside City Hall.

He was 87. His family announced the death. The Post said the cause was cancer. Mr. Wood’s background was the newspaper wars of Fleet Street in London, and he brought a brash, flamboyant flair to The Post, America’s oldest continuously continuously published daily newspaper. Front-page headlines combined combined concision and dark humor. An article about a teenager?s suicide suicide inspired the headline ?Boy Gulps Gas. Explodes.? When the crowd stampeded at a Who concert concert in Cincinnati, the headline read. “Eleven Dead and the Band Played On.? “Granny Executed in Her Pink Pajamas” spoke for itself. itself. The most famous headline under under Mr. Wood?s stewardship hits become newspaper legend: “Headless Body in Topless Bar.? It summarized the grim tale of a mad killer who murdered the owner of a Queens bar in April 1983, then took the patrons hostage. hostage. Learning that one hostage was an undertaker, he ordered her to cut off the owner’s head, which he put in a box and took with him. In his book about The Post. ?It’s Alive!: How America’s Oldest Oldest Newspaper Cheated Death and Why It Matters? (1996), the longtime Post editor Steven D. Cuozzo said the story epitomized the newspaper’s “taste for discovering discovering the profound in the profane.? profane.? “Its appearance in the nation’s largest city,” he wrote, “blew down the restraints on coverage of unspeakable crime.? Mr. Wood covered both the grittiness and the glamour of New York in a no-holds-barred style that he contended other newspapers shied away from. He increased The Post’s arts coverage coverage even as he turned up the burner on crime coverage. ?Broadway and nuns raped in Washington Heights are part and parcel of the fabric of New York,” lie told Mr. Cuozzo. ?What the hell is Broadwav if not part of New York?? Mr Wood succeeded Edwin Bolwell as editor in July 1977, about six months after Mr Murdoch Murdoch bought The Post from Dorothy Dorothy Schiff He brought a demanding demanding manner to the newsroom and worked closely with Mr. Murdoch in developing Page Six. the irreverent irreverent daily helping of gossip. Mr. Wood told The Associated Press in 2007 that when he was on vacation, Mr. Murdoch actually actually took over editing the paper. But Mr. Wood was in some ways bolder than Mr. Murdoch: he did not print the “Headless Body? headline until the day after Mr. Murdoch left town. The initial report report of that crime, the day before, had run modestly inside. Mr. Wood’s efforts helped raise The Post?s circulation from neighbor in New York, to protest a service there honoring Gen. Colin L. Powell and other participants participants in Operation Desert Storm. In New Jersey, he picketed his own bishop for belonging to segregated segregated clubs. He once picketed himself, joining joining ranks with workers seeking a better contract from St. Mary’s Episcopal Center, an AIDS hospice hospice he founded in Harlem. Father Castle was arrested so often that, as Mr. Demme’s film relates, his children were entirely accustomed to asking, “How much is the bail. Mom?? “He was an angry white man, I’ll tell you,? Mr. Demme said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ?He really found fault with so many ways that people of color are treated in America; it infuriated infuriated him. That said, he was a lot of fun.? Father Castle’s crackling onscreen onscreen presence in ?Cousin Bobby? Bobby? led to roles in more than a dozen fiction films. Among them was ?Philadelphia? (1993), directed directed by Mr. Demme, in which he played Bud Beckett, the father of the young lawyer Andrew Beckett. Beckett. played by Tom Hanks, who is dying of AIDS. Unfazed by civil disobedience and its consequences, Father Castle quailed at the prospect of kissing Joanne Woodward, who played his wife. Mr. Demme later said. His other films for Mr. Demme include ?Beloved? (1998) and “Rachel Getting Married? (2008). His films for other directors include include ?The Addiction?

It is here that 1 find artichokes so young they can be eaten raw, a Cotes du Rhone so smooth it could be a fine burgundy, and a cow cheese so creamy it’s best eaten with a spoon. I take my cues from the late, great Julia Child. “The Parisian Parisian grocers insisted that I interact interact with them personally,” Julia wrote in her 2006 autobiography. autobiography. ?My Life in France.? “If I wasn’t willing to take the time to get to know them and their wares, then I would not go home with the freshest legumes or cuts of meat in my basket. They certainly certainly made me work for my supper.? So I interact. I work for my supper. Sometimes I even pretend pretend to be Julia, with her American-accented French. I caress tomatoes, inspect lamb loins, sniff Camembert, sample wild boar charcuterie and go all wobbly over sugarcoated brioche. No one except my children makes fun of me. I have been embraced as a member of the neighborhood ?family,” as the merchants call the has (lower) Rue des Martyrs. They know and seem to like — one another. When I needed a stool small enough to fit into a shower after my older daughter injured her leg, the manager of the variety store borrowed one for me from the nearby jeweler. When Fahmi Hamrouni.a greengrocer at the Petit Jardin (No. 3). ran out of flat green beans one day, he grabbed handfuls for me from the greengrocer across the street. The feeling of intimacy is enhanced on Sunday mornings, when several blocks of the street moving up from the Notre Dame de Lorette Church in the Ninth Arrondissement are closed off to traffic. The “family? designation conies with privileges but also a code of conduct: smile and say ?bonjour” to every merchant merchant you pass, ideally stop in for a chat It can take 30 minutes to walk a few hundred feet. So the neighbors were thunderstruck Oct. 16 when the Poissonnerie Bleue, the street’s fish market (No. 5), with no advance advance warning, posted a dire message on its chalkboard: ?The fish store will close for good on October 31,2012. Thank you. The Management.? Apparently there had been a longstanding longstanding dispute between Marc Briolay, the 53*year-old owner, and the landlord over who was responsible for repairs. The Briolays stopped paying rent; the landlord ordered them to leave. The fish store had been in business for more than a half-century. Mr. Briolay Briolay started working there as a teenager in 1978 and built it into a family-run operation. operation. Tomas, his 22-year-old son, cleaned and filleted the fish.

The shop employed other full-time and part-time workers, including Joel Vicogne, 50. who started working there when he was 16 and happened to be the son of the landlord (who once ran the shop with his uncle). No matter how busy the shop was, how long the line stretched onto the sidewalk, there was time to talk about fish. I learned, for example, that an ugly-faced pink-orange, firm-fleshed fish called sebaste (a variety of ocean perch) is excellent when stuffed with shallots or fennel and baked whole, that cod works well with pesto, that red mullet mullet is not too delicate to fillet and saut£.

Justine told me how to make linguine linguine with shrimp, fish quenelles and beurre blanc with white wine and shallots. Marc, who manned the cash register, always threw a lemon and a bunch of parsley into my bag and shaved two or three euros off the bill. Jacques Bravo, the mayor of the Ninth Arrondissement, struggled to prevent the inevitable. He turned up on the Rue des Martyrs in a pinstriped pinstriped suit, gray cashmere scarf and Legion of Honor pin one Sunday morning after the announcement of the closing, shook a lot of hands and promised to help save the day. To no avail. Mr. Briolay had closed his shop for the last time — three days early. The burden of history intensified the suffering.

Legend has it that St. Denis was decapitated on what is now the Rue Yvonne Le Tac at the top of the Rue des Martyrs for preaching the Christian Gospel. He picked up his head, washed it off and carried it five miles to the north before dying. By the 18th century, the half-mile street had become the physical spine of the neighborhood: by the 19th, a center of commerce. The sense of community even extended extended to self-employed women of uneven morality called Les Lorettes, kept women women who eked out a living on the Rue des Martyrs and nearby streets in the 19th century. Unlike prostitutes, who lived in designated houses, the Lorettes had more freedom to work essentially as independent independent contractors. Where There’s Smoke ... With Jake Dickson, David Schuttenberg and Robbie Richter on the case, a smoked turkey becomes worthy of the Thanksgiving feast. Mr. Schuttenberg. the executive executive chef of Dickson’s Farmstand Meats in the Chelsea Chelsea Market, rubs Amish country turkeys (raised without without hormones or antibiotics) with herbs and soy sauce, brines them and sends them to Connecticut, where Mr. Richter, who was the pitmaster at Fatty ?Cue, hot-smokes them for three and a half hours. The white and dark meat emerge delicately smoky, moist and succulent after reheating (about an hour at 250 degrees). The birds, 12 to 14 pounds, come wrapped with netting; remove it before reheating.

FRTIi R roNRAD?TME NEW YORK TIMES The bas (lower) part, which is older, was — and still is — considered the real street. Many of its shops are related to the bouche (mouth), meaning they?re food shops. The bas Rue des Martyrs prides itself on its permanence. The Boucherie Billebault. Billebault. a thriving butcher shop, at No. 3. has been operated by the same family since 1899. The brasserie at the corner of the Rue Lamartine ( No. 2) dates back more than a century. A hardware store has been at No. 1 since 1842. A pharmacy pharmacy at No. 4 was mentioned in city archives archives as early as 1848. When Mr. Briolay announced his departure, departure, the personnel at the bakery at No. 10 (a bakery has been there since 1868) drafted a handwritten petition demanding demanding that only another fish store be allowed in the space; 200 signatures were collected and sent to City Hall. ?It’s a scandal,? said Valerie Levin, who runs the bakery with her husband. “We don’t need another cheese shop, or butcher or bakery on our end of the street. We need diversity to stay alive. Without a fish store, the street is dead.? Ezzdine Ben Abdollah, a greengrocer nearby, said; “It’s hard work, but there’s money in fish. If I knew fish, I’d take the place myself.? I made the point to various merchants that there’s another fish store several blocks up the street toward Montmartre. Kevin Losbar. the 26-year-old manager, runs a perfectly respectable. respectable. if much smaller fish store. But that fish store is on the other side of the unofficial dividing dividing line at the Rue Manuel, where the incline up the hill en route to Montmartre becomes steeper. This is the beginning of the haut (high) Rue des Martyrs, infested with real estate estate agencies, clothing stores and upscale boutiques eager to invade south. An American-style cupcake and cookie shop recently moved in. So did a Subway sandwich shop and a cafe that features Sunday brunch and smoothies. The bas merchants consider the upper part an enclave of transients and arrivistes. arrivistes. “It’s too far away,? said Yves Chataigner, Chataigner, who runs a cheese store with his wife, Annick, at No. 3 on the bas Rue des Martyrs. ?It could be New York.? Thus far, there have been no takers for the fish store, according to Mr. Bravo. Bravo. It will not be Mr. Vicogne. who has no intention of taking over the lease. “Fish is too tough.? he said. ?You have to be at the wholesale market at 2,3 in the morning. You have to be on your feet in rubber boots eight hours a day. You don?t get enough vacation.? Paradoxically, the drastic gentrification gentrification of the Rue des Martyrs and the surrounding surrounding streets (real estate agents call the neighborhood Village Martyrs) in the last two decades has hurt traditional merchants. Young, upwardly mobile two-income couples with little time to cook have moved in; many older residents residents have moved out. So have some of the merchants There had been a charcuterie at No. 6 rue des Martyrs since 1849; when it moved out last year, a store specializing in prepared rotisserie chickens and sides replaced it. A year before that, a sliver of a newspaper newspaper kiosk was turned almost overnight overnight into an A.T.M. Mr. Bravo is determined. He has sent out an all-points bulletin to his fellow mayors in the 19 other arrondissements asking if they know of a motivated fishmonger. fishmonger. After all, France’s National Confederation of Fishmongers and Oyster Oyster Openers has started a training program program in which 85 students are enrolled. “It’s extremely difficult to find someone someone to take over a big space like this,? he said. “It?s much easier to sell fish at outdoor markets. But I ?m an old marathon marathon runner. I did New York eight times I?m in this for the long run. We only need to find one.? But folks on the street are skeptical that the city will enforce regulations that require artisanal shops in certain zones to be replaced by similar businesses businesses and keep the fish store closed until another fishmonger can be found. They point out the fate of the street’s independently owned florist shop last year. Even though the space was restricted restricted for an “artisanal? business, Kiehl?s, the American beauty products chain, got around the restriction and moved in. It installed two barber?s chairs and called itself an artisan. Seeing Red Inside the Shell A walnut of a different color has arrived arrived in New York.

1150,1932796258,"The Get-Into-School Card CONTINUED FROM PAGE I schools, according lo the Department of Education. Although the overall number of children on waiting lists is down slightly from last year, waiting lists at some schools soared. The waiting list at P. S. 41 in Greenwich Village had 100 students, up from 55 last year, and the one at P. S. 507 in Queens had 107, up from 109. Many children on waiting lists end up securing spots as families of enrolled children pursue other options: moving away; placing their children in private private schools or gifted-and-talcnted programs; programs; or winning lotteries for charterschool charterschool admission. But the wait to find out can be excruciating excruciating By the end of June, those who remain on a waiting list will receive an offer of an alternative school. All of this is forcing families to consider new ways to navigate the city school system. system. Some do school research even before a child is born. Other parents pay specialists specialists to help identify neighborhoods with up-and-coming schools, the hope being that if they move to these places now, the school will have improved by the time their child reaches kindergarten. Still others rent a home in a top school zone. Then, if they find themselves priced out when it comes time to buy an apartment, apartment, they’ll move to a more affordable neighborhood. The child will be able to stay put, schoolwise, because city policy is basically “once you’re in, you’re in.” There have always been people who outright outright lie by borrowing an address from a friend or relative to get their children into a school. It caught, however, those students students will lose their seats. Sure, it’s easy to mock the neuroses of New York City parents when it comes to their offspring, as films and documentaries have done. But the city poses unique challenges, challenges, and as a result, more families are thinking earlier about where they want to live in relation to what it means for their children’s education. ?Anyone who thinks it through realizes you can’t count on one option,” said Christine Christine Dirringer, a commodities banker who, with her partner, Keith Richards, also a commodities banker, is selling an Upper West Side two-bedroom and looking for a town house in Carroll Gardens or Park Slope. The reasoning: Both areas have good public and private school options and offer more space for the money. Chloe, their daughter, hasn’t celebrated her first birthday yet. “It’s crazy to be considering schools when she’s only 7 months old,” Ms. Dirringer Dirringer said. “But I’d rather have a plan, knowing how difficult it can be to get in.” Here are some of the ways families with young children are approaching the complicated complicated calculus of real estate and education education in the city. Renting in a Good School Zone Renting or buying in a given school zone may be the most straightforward strategy for getting into a popular public school. But neighborhoods with coveted public schools tend to be pricey. The good news is if you can’t afford to stay, your children don’t have to switch schools. They have the right to remain in the same public school until graduation, regardless regardless of where in the city the family lives after registration day, according to the Department of Education. The idea behind behind this longstanding regulation is to offer offer stability to children. “Continuity and stability help teachers and schools tailor instruction for the needs of each child over the long term,” Devon Puglia, a spokesman for the Education Department, Department, wrote in an e-mail. “When students students jump from school to school either midyear or between grades, personalization personalization is difficult.” Some parents in overcrowded schools bristle at families who take advantage of the rule with no intention of staying in the neighborhood. But the Education Department Department does not track the movement of families families after enrollment. And families who end up leaving the zone often would prefer to stay but can’t for financial reasons. When Sundus Kubba moved from Ann Arbor, Mich., to take an investment banking banking job in New? York four years ago, she and her husband, Joe Ka/emi, a graduate student and independent statistician, searched for a rental that would put their daughter, Maya, within the zone for the highly sought-after P. S. 87 on the Upper West Side. “We had to be very specific with addresses addresses - what side of a street an apartment apartment was on,” Mr. Kazemi recalled. The couple rented a two-bedroom on the second floor of a walk-up two blocks from P. S. 87. In 2011, Maya began kindergarten at the school, which offers a dual-language program of English and Spanish and runs through fifth grade. This year, with Maya in first grade, the family searched for a place to buy in the neighborhood but found nothing they could afford. So with the help of Stefania Cardinali, a broker at Citi Habitats, they began looking in Harlem and Hamilton Heights. “We can get more for our money uptown,” uptown,” said Mr. Kazemi, noting that the 15to 15to 25-minute subway commute wasn’t bad. Last month the couple went into contract on a two-bedroom two-bath apartment with a private rooftop cabana in a fullservice fullservice building in Hamilton Heights for $580,000. A recent online search for a comparable comparable place in the P. S. 87 zone found listings listings front $995,000 to $3.85 million. Though school quality was a factor in their search, Mr. Kazemi added, the fact that Maya can remain at P S. 87 is “fantastic “fantastic for us.? Now the family is zoned for P. S. 153, which has lower lest scores than P. S. 87, but also has gifted-and-talentod classes and language and art programs. Find an Up-and-Coming School School advisers say more parents are apartment-hunting in neighborhoods that offer promising schools with strong leadership leadership and rising attendance rates, including Green point and Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, Brooklyn, and parts of South Harlem, Inwood and Washington Heights in Manhattan. For instance, respectable options like P. S. 180 in Harlem, which teaches prekindergarten prekindergarten through eighth grade, have remained remained under the radar mainly because they served a low-income community, said Clara Hemphill, the founder of Insideschools.org, Insideschools.org, a project of the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School that offers profiles of city schools. ?It was always a terrific school with a terrific principal,” Ms. Hemphill said, ?but its test scores reflected the fact that poor kids tend not to get a fancy preschool education.? education.? P. S. 180’s attributes, she added, include include small classes and active parents. ?Now, we’re seeing more middle-class parents parents choosing it.” Julianna LeMieux, an assistant professor professor of biology at Mercy College, visited schools in Washington Heights, Harlem and the Upper West Side last June in preparation preparation for a move from Boston; her husband, husband, Mark Emerson, had accepted a new job. “We were willing to do whatever it t(X)k to get our sons into a good school,? she said. That included squeezing themselves and their boys, 6 and 2, into a one-bedroom on the Upper West Side if necessary. But after visiting P. S. ISO and being impressed by the small class sizes and the diversity of the student population, she narrowed her search to condos in that school’s zone. There were five listings in the Harlem area within their budget. The couple bought a two-bedroom with one and a half baths and a washer/dryer, listed for $520,000. Their elder son, Isaiah, began Top, Joe Kazemi and Sundus Kubba were careful to rent in Public School 87’s zone on the Upper West Side, and their daughter, Mava, enrolled there. The child now has a secure berth there, even though the family will he moving elsewhere in the city. Jonathan Cohen and Kelly Bare, the parents of Brew and Lizzie, bought a place wagering that the local school, in Crown Heights, would have shared in the area’s upward trajectory by the time the children were of school age, and their bet paid off. Center photo, in pink, the children’s friend Olive Carney, 3, came by to play. kindergarten in September at P. S. 180. Ms. LeMieux says the principal greets students students by name each morning at drop-off. ?It ended up being a great match,” she added. “I can see Morningside Park from our window and like being so close to Central Central Park.? The number of children they saw in the neighborhood when they moved in, she added, “really spoke to the fact that this is probably going to be a good place, a comfortable place to have for years.” A Developing Neighborhood Schools don’t always follow their neighborhood?s neighborhood?s upward trajectory. “Every neighborhood is different,? said Joyce Szuflita, Szuflita, the founder of NYC School Help, which helps families find schools in Brooklyn, Brooklyn, ?but what 1 find is the gentrification of the school lags many years behind a gentrification gentrification of a neighborhood. People occasionally occasionally move in when they’re pregnant and say this neighborhood is awesome and diverse and rich, and then their kids get to be school age and they’re like, huh?? Many of those families, she said, end up trying to “squeak into the schools? in better-established better-established neighborhoods nearby. But there is often another contingent a core group of new families who are “drawn to a school that looks promising,? Ms. Szuflita said. Kelly Bare, an editor at The New Yorker magazine, and her husband, Jonathan Cohen, Cohen, the music booker for “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,” traded a studio in the East Village for a two-bedroom rental in Prospect Heights about live years ago. Schools weren’t the first thing on their minds. “We were just trying to wrap our heads around being parents,” said Ms. Bare, w?ho was pregnant with their first child at the time. In search of more space and a familyfriendly familyfriendly vibe, she said, they were attracted by the neighborhood’s good transportation, transportation, proximity to Prospect Park and cultural cultural institutions like the Brooklyn Museum Museum — not to mention the more affordable affordable rents. But soon, apartment prices began to climb, and they had been hoping to buy. The couple decided to hunt on the edge of the neighborhood, on the border of Crown Heights, where they would lx* able to afford more space. But the school situation w*as mixed. While Public Schools 9 and 316 in Prospect Heights were gaining attention, P. S. 22 in Crown Heights was underperforming. Enrollment Enrollment dropped, test scores remained low, safety concerns were raised and teachers complained of unresponsive and demoralizing leadership. Nevertheless, in 2010 Ms. Bare and Mr. Cohen took the leap and bought a new three-bedroom condo on the Crown Heights border for about $600,000. “We knew we could not afford to buy that kind of space in a zone where the schools were already proven,” Ms. Bare said. “We took a calculated risk — buying an apartment that we loved, on the edge of a neighborhood that we loved, in an area we presumed would change fairly rapidly.? Part of the plan was to get involved in a local school and ?actively recruit likeminded likeminded families,” Ms. Bare said. But ultimately, ultimately, “we kind of took a gamble that our trajectory would be the same as the school trajectory.? Timing, it turned out, was on their side. The following year the city announced that it would phase out P. S. 22 and replace it with P. S 705, also known as the Brooklyn Arts and Science Elementary School. P. S. 705 shares a new building with Exceed Charter School, which currently teaches through third grade and offers dual-language dual-language immersion starting in prekindergarten, prekindergarten, as well as art, music, dance and fencing. fencing. ?It’s like a little gem,? said Ms. Bare, who enrolled Drew, 5, her older child, in prekindergarten and plans to have her daughter, Lizzie, 2, follow in 2015. SCORECARD You know where you would like to live. Now what about the schools? Here are live things to consider when evaluating a school, particularly in changing neighborhoods. Leadership Is Key School advisers agree that a charismatic principal with a clear vision and a deep respect for students is crucial. Enthusiastic teachers and active parents tend to follow. Attendance Rising attendance rates — a sign that more families are being drawn to a school — are often a leading leading indicator of improvement. Beyond Scores Although the number number of students meeting state standards standards is important, improvements in school quality may not be reflected in test scores until the kindergartners who benefited from new teaching methods, for example, are tested for the first time in the third grade. What’s on the Walls? Proudly displayed displayed student projects that demonstrate demonstrate individual thought and creativity creativity are what you want to see, rather than cookie-cutter art projects or decorations made by the teacher. You can also tell a lot about writing skills by what students have composed. composed. Are Parents Involved? Invitations for parents to volunteer, attend school events or take ownership of the school in some way can indicate a supportive community. MICHELLE HIGGINS Sources: Robin Aronow of Schoolsearchnyc.com, Clara Hemphill Hemphill of Insideschools. org. and Joyce S/uflita of NYC School Help Move lo Afford Private School Hu* expense and competition involved in sending a child to a good private school in the city is monumental. But with no guarantee guarantee that their child will end up in a topnotch topnotch public school, some families are viewing private education as a safety net and, gambling that their child gets in, are willing to move to a cheaper place to fund the tuition. In other words: live small, educate educate big. Marcia Giordano, a New York City real estate broker, and her husband, Shawn, a private chef, were thrilled when P. S. 276, a new elementary school in Battery Park City, opened near their home in 2009, just after the birth of their son. Otto. They had outgrown their one-bedroom. But rather than sell it in a down market, they held onto it and moved to a larger rental unit in the building, so as to remain in the same school zone. Then last year, after Otto, then 3, was put on the waiting list for P. S. 276’s pre-K program, their plan began to feel tenuous. Parents at P. S. 276 were petitioning to limit next year’s kindergarten kindergarten to avoid overcrowding. So the family moved out of the zone to a cheaper two-bedroom rental in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, on what Ms. Giordano calls “the fringe? of Dumbo. They are thus saving about a third of their monthly housing costs and tunneling that directly into tuition for a private pre-K program for Otto and child care for their daughter, Cliieko, 1. If their plans change again, they can always squeeze back into the apartment they own. ?Who knows what will happen with public public school?” Ms. Giordano said. ?We have to keep the door open for private school. That was the impetus for moving. ?No matter what,? she added, “it’s ultimately ultimately a crapshoot.

In a 4,200-square-foot building formerly formerly occupied by an architecture and fabrication firm, the club has a flexible layout, with whitewashed brick walls that accentuate its changing lighting display. Musicians praise its sound system; system; its capacity for audio and video recording, recording, which is often used to stream multiplicity of styles — from cartoonish humor to earnest sentimentality to cutting cutting satire, with much music woven into the blend — forms an unstable mixture that challenges director and actors alike. The sweet love story between Grusha and the earnest young soldier Simon (a stiff Alex Hurt) has an archly naive quality that the actors cannot quite render render human. It doesn?t help that Simon tends to speak of his beloved in the third person: “ May one ask if a certain person person is still in the habit of putting her leg in the water when washing her linen?” he says by way of flirtation. And while Ms. Davis sings with a dark, soulful intensity intensity in a steel-edged voice that feels right both for Brecht and the moody rock music of Mr. Sheik, there’s sometimes sometimes an opaque, remote quality to her performance that dampens the force of Grusha’s natural innocence. The comedy mostly comes through robustly. The scene in which Grusha grudgingly marries a dying man is enlivened enlivened by the recruitment of audience volunteers. “Due to the extravagant shortsightedness of artistic management management there are not enough members of the r to make for a proper wedding part; ?ays an actor in apologetic tones and tidCtured, Russian-accented English.

He gave shelter to a man in desperate need, only to discover that the man was the hunted, hated overlord the Grand Duke.

His father died when he was 5, and two years later his mother moved the family to Italy, where she became a pillar pillar of the contemporary-dance culture. Mr. Garrison returned to the United States at the age of 17, to avoid Italian military service, moving in with the drummer Jack DeJohnette, who became became his godfather in the process. (Probably the most buzzed-about event in ShapeShifter Lab?s brief history was a show in February featuring Mr. DeJohnette, Mr. Garrison and the saxophonist saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, John’s son.) Mr. Garrison finished high school in Woodstock, N.Y., and then attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, before before embarking on a professional capened, capened, Azdak has been appointed to run the local court. Mr. Lloyd, best known for his mad-scientist role in the “Back to the Future” movies, brings a funny, crusty exuberance to Azdak’s almost Groucho Marxian (Marxist?) shtick as he presides over a series of cases, taking taking bribes and dispensing whimsical judgments that lampoon the workings of justice. Any system in which much power resides in the hands of a single man will automatically lead to abuse and corruption, Brecht implies, but In the topsy-turvy court run by Azdak, irrational irrational abuse at least occasionally favors favors the poor. The scenes in which the anarchy of Azdak’s justice is displayed could benefit benefit from a brisker pace, but Mr. Lloyd’s juicy performance carries us through to the play’s climactic scene, in which Azdak must decide to whom the baby will be given: Grusha, who has cared for him and come to love him, or the governor’s wife, who has tracked them down and insists that her maternal rights be recognized.

She had run two successful businesses businesses in her native Hong Kong, and she developed a business plan for ShapeShifter ShapeShifter Lab, which gets its name from “ShapeShifter,” a fusion album Mr. Garrison Garrison released in 2004. The ingrained ambivalence about fusion, fusion, at least among established jazz clubs in New York, was another cause Mr. Garrison sought to address with the club. “Where can we play?? he said, throwing his hands up. “Some of those venues, there’s just no way in. So by default, default, what we have to do here is the exact exact opposite.” He spent a lot of time early on persuading persuading his peers to play the club, but at this point, notwithstanding next month?s festivities, the calendar is almost entirely entirely filled with artists who pitch themselves. themselves. Less established bands are booked as openers, and midlevel acts are encouraged to form double bills. “The booking process is the easiest part,? Mr. Garrison said, though he was quick to note that Ms. Sung handled the details. They agreed that the hardest pai l involves involves maintaining good relations with their neighbors, along with the typical hassles of running a club.

Secretary The Annual Republican Crisis Extremists on the right are ready to shut down government if they can’t cripple health reform The fiscal year is about to end, so the annual awakening of Tea Party Republicans in the House and Senate is about to begin. Most of the time they sit around and do virtually nothing but gripe (they have made the current Congress the least productive ever), but a new fiscal year finally gives them a chance to govern the only way they know how: by creating a false crisis in order to tear down a piece of the government. This year, as has been the case so often in the past, their target is President Obama’s health care reform law. If it is not repealed or defunded or delayed or otherwise left bleeding in the public square, they will not pass a spending bill needed to keep the government open past Sept. 30. And if that doesn’t cripple the health law (which it won’t), they will resort to the far more serious threat of default, refusing to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, no matter the catastrophe that would cause. It has been clear for months that House Republicans are not going to agree to the Senate’s reasonable spending plan for 2014, one that replaces the damage of the sequester with a mix of revenue increases and less-harmful cuts. The House budget, in fact, calls for cuts to below the sequester level. The best that can be hoped for is a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, to keep the government running through mid-December at this year’s inadequate level. But on Wednesday, with time running out, House leaders leaders announced they couldn’t manage even something as simple as that. Speaker John Boehner and Eric Cantor, the majority leader, had come up with a far-fetched scheme to placate the radicals in their coalition by attaching a provision provision to the spending resolution that would force the Senate to vote on defunding health reform. The Senate would, of course, instantly reject the health care language, but it could then approve the spending measure to prevent a shutdown. Tips and Poverty The minimum wage for tipped workers has not been raised since 1991 When The Times’s restaurant critic, Pete Wells, recently recently called tipping “irrational, outdated, ineffective, confusing, prone to abuse and sometimes discriminatory,” he was referring referring mainly to mid- to high-priced restaurants that are considering an end to the practice in favor of surcharges or service-included pricing. In the diners and other more “value oriented” restaurants restaurants that employ most of the nation’s burgeoning ranks of waitresses (the vast majority of servers are female), tips are all that and more. They are part of a parallel economic universe in which employers are allowed to pay sub-minimum sub-minimum wages, with predictably devastating results. According According to census data, servers are far more likely than other workers to live in poverty. It is a national disgrace when hard work, in any industry, industry, leaves workers in poverty. But falling living standards and economic hardship among tipped workers signal prolonged prolonged stagnation throughout the economy. That’s because employment growth in restaurants and bars has outpaced growth in nearly all other sectors in recent years, including health care, manufacturing, retail and financial services. If wages in food-service and other service jobs are not lifted, it is hard to see where adequate consumer demand will come from to generate and sustain a real recovery. It is not tipping that most needs to end, however. What needs to change is the federal law that sets the minimum wage for tipped workers at S2.13 an hour, compared with an already measly hourly minimum of S7.25 for other workers. Under the law, as long as S2.13 an hour plus tips works out to at least S7.25 an hour, an employer is in compliance with national national labor standards. In effect, a tip for the waitress is a wage subsidy for her employer. In recent decades, the situation has become increasingly increasingly unfair. The sub-minimum “tipped” wage was first instiBirmingham instiBirmingham Sunday Nineteen sixty-three, the year of the March on Washington Washington and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s greatest speech, was as pivotal in American history as 1863, the year of Gettysburg and the Emancipation Proclamation. It is easy, gazing backward, to see that year as a great milestone in an inexorable march toward justice and equality, from Emmett Till to Rosa Parks to Barack Obama. Easy, but incomplete. That is why it is helpful to pause to remember how difficult the path was, how uncertain, by recalling the terrifying moment that occurred 50 years ago Sunday, not even three weeks after “I Have a Dream.” It was the bombing in Birmingham, Ala., of the 16th Street Baptist Church. That act of homegrown terrorism, which killed four young girls, sent a brutal message that the old order order had no intention of surrendering and would not go down without bloodshed. “Carry Me Home,? Diane McWhorter?s epic history of Birmingham in the civil rights struggle, tells the story in chilling detail — of Klansmen plotting, their ties to the police and the power structure giving them the reasonable expectation expectation of getting away with murder. In fact, the investigation languished and nobody went to jail for more than a decade. The last bomber was convicted in 2002. The church today stands as solid as ever, across from a civil rights institute and from Kelly Ingram Park, ground zero for protests and the atrocities of Bull Connor and his The Republican extremists killed the idea, leaving the scheme without enough votes. They are no longer interested interested in symbolic blows against the health law; there have already already been scores of those votes. They actually think they can get the Senate, and ultimately the president, to approve the defunding of the health law — Mr. Obama’s most important important achievement — by threatening to harm the nation and the economy. This is pure delusion. Democrats are never going to undo the law, especially knowing the size of the self-inflicted wound Republicans would suffer if they really did force a shutdown or, far worse, a default. But the powerful forces on the right don’t care about reality. The Club for Growth, a conservative group, announced it would use its dreaded ratings ratings system against any Republican who supported a continuing continuing resolution that did not “defund Obamacare.? According to the Senate Conservatives Fund, an activist activist group, “House Republican leaders have chickened out and decided to fund a program that will destroy our country.” country.” The group, founded by former Senator Jim DeMint, promised to run primary challengers against those who don’t vote to destroy the law. Mr. Boehner, too, bears responsibility for the chaos that engulfs him. On Thursday, he demanded health-law concessions concessions from Democrats, even as he announced that “we’ll continue to do everything we can to repeal, dismantle and defund Obamacare.” This only raises expectations on the right that the impossible might be achieved, as Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, put it, “in an alternative universe.” universe.” What the speaker should be doing is the only thing that will spare the economy this unnecessary trauma: putting a clean spending bill and debt-ceiling increase before the full House for a vote, making it clear that the shrill voices of extremists extremists have been silenced. tuted in 1966, when it was set at 50 percent of the minimum wage. At the time, that was an improvement. Until then, the restaurant industry had successfully lobbied Congress to deny tipped workers any minimum-wage protection, leaving leaving them to live on tips alone. Over the next 30 years, the tipped wage sometimes rose as high as 60 percent of the minimum wage, but it never fell below 50 percent, reaching its current level of S2.13 an hour in 1991. Then, in 1996, the Republican-led Congress agreed to raise the minimum wage, but on the condition that the tipped wage remain frozen. It has not budged since, and today today it is 29 percent of the minimum wage. Fortunately, seven states — Alaska, California, Minnesota, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington — have rejected rejected the notion of a separate tipped wage and require instead instead that tipped workers be paid at least the full minimum wage, which is often higher on the state level than on the federal level. California, for example, has just passed a bill to raise its state minimum wage to S10 an hour by 2016, and the governor governor is expected to sign it soon. Many other states have set their tipped wage higher than the federal level, but still allow some of a worker’s tips to be counted toward fulfilling the minimum-wage requirement. An additional 18 states continue to follow the federal law, with its tipped wage of $2.13 an hour. Congressional Democrats have introduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and to set the tipped wage at 70 percent of the minimum. That would be a step in the right direction, not only in raising the living standards of a growing segment of the labor force, but in reestablishing reestablishing Washington’s leadership, long abandoned, in setting and promoting fair wages. dogs and fire hoses.

But it?s worth remembering a point Ms. McWhorter McWhorter has powerfully made: the civil rights struggle was not simply a victory of good over evil, of the righteous defeating the Klansmen who gave ?Bombingham? its bloody reputation. reputation. The struggle was good against ‘?normal” — against the segregation that was seen as the natural order of things, buttressed by government, tradition and the law. In this, Dr. King and his allies were the radicals. The most radical thing was their willful commitment to peace as a weapon for change and as a check on justified rage. The clouds from the dynamite blast had not even cleared when the Rev. John Cross stood before a furious crowd on the church?s front steps and said, “We should be forgiving as Christ was forgiving.” Then he handed a megaphone megaphone to the Rev. Charles Billups, who said: “Go home and pray for the men who did this evil deed. We must have love in our hearts for these men.” Soon afterward, the bodies of Addie Mae Collins, Denise Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley were uncovered in the rubble of what had been the women’s washroom. Shrouded in dust, “they looked like old women.? Addie Mae, Carole and Cynthia were 14, and Denise was 11. Notebook Doing Business in Bangladesh The owner of a clothing factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was at New York University last week to meet with clothing industry executives, labor activists and American and European European government officials to talk about the Bangladeshi garment garment industry, the world’s second-biggest exporter of clothes after China. The workplace disasters in this business have grabbed the world’s attention, and for the past year, Western retailers that outsource their clothing production to Bangladesh have tried to come up with reforms. But there are big obstacles to improving safety in an industry driven by low profits and constant constant upheaval. I met with the businessman and another factory owner; both would speak only on the condition that they not be identified identified because they feared offending their customers. A central problem, the first owner told me, is the rapid turnaround big retailers like Walmart demand when they put in orders for tens of thousands of T-shirts or shorts. Since his factory isn’t able to make all the garments in time, he has to send some of the work to smaller producers. “I can’t do it officially,” he said, “but unofficially, I can.” Unauthorized subcontracting to smaller, uninspected factories factories is not supposed to happen, but it remains an entrenched practice. It is a primary reason safety guidelines that apply to bigger contractors have not prevented the hundreds of worker worker deaths in fires and building collapses in facilities like Rana Plaza, which crumbled last April killing 1,129 people. The factory owners admitted that what they were doing was wrong. But they said Western clothing companies were also culpable because they often award contracts to manufacturers manufacturers that they know do not have enough machines and employees employees to do the job. Every player has motives to look the other way. The retailers retailers ignore the subcontracting because they would rather manage fewer big contracts, and the per-piece price of garments garments falls with bigger orders. Suppliers don’t turn down giant giant orders because they fear they will be shut out of future jobs. “Any vendor in Bangladesh thinks thrice before saying no,? the second owner said to me. And the subcontractors, the lowest on the ladder, are desperate for orders, compete brutally brutally and cannot afford to upgrade their workshops. Still, the two owners said there are ways to improve the system. Western companies should not award contracts that are so big suppliers cannot realistically fill them without subcontracting. subcontracting. “There should be a switchboard and the red light should go on,” one said. Both pointed to H?M, the Swedish clothing retailer that buys more clothes from Bangladesh than any other Western company, as a model for other firms to follow. follow. They said the company establishes multiyear relationships relationships with factories and keeps track of every subcontractor, including small workshops that might screen-print T-shirts and embroider clothes. “If customers like H?M didn’t push us,? the second owner owner said, “we wouldn’t do a lot of things.” Of course, the government government needs to step up factory inspections, and Bangladeshi manufacturers should invest more of their profits into making their factories safer. But none of this will happen if clothing retailers retailers in the United States and Europe do not demand it and help pay for it. VIKAS BAJAJ Stars With Their Hands Out Since 2009 the crowdfunding Web site Kickstarter has matched artists and entrepreneurs struggling to finance creative creative projects with people on the Internet willing to contribute a little cash. The earliest adopters of the technology, on the pitching side, were small-time musicians, unestablished filmmakers filmmakers and others with no clear access to capital. Gradually, however, more prominent types have discovered discovered the site. In March, Rob Thomas, creator of the TV series “Veronica Mars,” and Kristen Bell, the star of the show, used Kickstarter to finance “Veronica Mars” the movie. They set a target of S2 million and ultimately brought in $5.7 million from more than 90,000 donors. In April, the actor-director Zach Braff raised $3.1 million for a follow-up to his 2004 directorial debut, “Garden State.? Over the summer Spike Lee, the two-time Academy Award nominee, took in $1.4 million for an untitled film about “human beings who are addicted to blood.” And two weeks ago Maria Pinto, who designed a dress Michelle Obama wore TOPOS GRAPHIC?S at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, launched a Kickstarter Kickstarter campaign with a goal of reaching $250,000 for a new line of women’s clothing. Kickstarter, once the domain of unknowns seeking their first big break, is now also a resource for big names intrigued by the potential of micropatronage. Not surprisingly, this cultural cultural shift has spurred howls of protest, with critical essays on celebrity “panhandling” washing over the media. There are two main arguments against the celebrity invasion. invasion. First is that it’s in poor taste for the rich-and-famous to solicit money from the public when they presumably have access access to more traditional financing or might even be able to self-finance projects. The second is that, like affluent professionals professionals descending on a cheap, hip neighborhood, celebrities are making Kickstarter less hospitable to aspiring artists. In May, the director Kevin Smith said he would never “suck any loot out of the crowdfunding marketplace that might otherwise otherwise go to a first-timer who can really use it.” The aversion to deep-pocketed stars on Kickstarter is understandable. understandable. But a big name does not guarantee access to financing financing for creative projects. Even established artists may struggle to attract investment — a point Mr. Lee made about his own experience in defending his decision to try crowdfunding. crowdfunding. Besides, anyone who feels uncomfortable is under no obligation to give. And contrary to what some believe, Kickstarter is not a zero-sum game. Instead of vacuuming up finite resources, celebrity celebrity campaigns seem to widen the donor pool. Forty-seven percent of Mr. Lee’s backers had never before contributed on Kickstarter. Once drawn in by a celebrity, donors may patronize patronize lesser-known artists. As the Kickstarter founders wrote on their blog in August, the ?Veronica Mars” and Zach Braff bids “brought thousands of new people to Kickstarter who have since pledged more than $1 million to 6,000 other projects.” The gentrification of Kickstarter doesn’t seem to be hurting hurting its original inhabitants. It may even be helping them.

With few exceptions, a canceled car is a slow-selling car. Some vehicles fail to meet expectations from the very start. Many more lose their relevance over time. It’s a rare automobile that is introduced with a firm expiration date in mind.

Drivers should instantly notice, notice, and appreciate, the Hyundai’s Hyundai’s slender proportions and comparatively lighter weight. For one, the Hyundai can turn around in a two-foot-tighter circle than the Nissan, Ford or Toyota. Pointed south from Monterey, Calif., to Los Angeles, my Santa Fe Limited carved a serene, softriding softriding path. Cranking 290 horsepower horsepower from a direct-injected 3.3iiter 3.3iiter V-6 — matching the Explorer Explorer for the most powerful standard 6-cylinder in the class — the Hyundai offers surprising hustle. Mated to a smooth 6-speed automatic automatic transmission, this V-6 likes to rev and sounds healthy doing it. With the optional trailer prep package, the Santa Fe can tow 5,000 pounds, matching the class’s best. In fact, this engine, which also makes haste in the big Hyundai Azera and Kia Cadenza sedans, may be the most distinguished in the Hyundai-Kia portfolio. (Yes, Hyundai’s 5-liter V-8 makes 429 horsepower in the roughly $60,000 Equus, but that engine and that car are niche players, at least for now.) Despite that modest curb weight, the Hyundai’s fuel economy economy is only adequate, at 18 miles per gallon in town and 25 on the highway, for the front-drive version version and 18/24 with optional allwheel allwheel drive. Those numbers roughly match the competition’s. Burnishing the brand’s reputation reputation for high-value interior design — the days when Hyundai cabins seemed barely first-world seem so long ago — the Santa Fe nails the optional navigation system and deftly balances simplicity with style. Materials, colors, shapes and textures please both the eyes and the hands. Naturally, Hyundai plumps the Santa Fe with standard goodies, especially in the Limited: 19-inch alloy wheels and keyless entry with push-button start; downhill brake control and hill-start assist; assist; power leather seats with ONLINF A VIDEO REVIEW K In a Driven video, Tom Voelk stretches out in the larger Santa Fe. nytimes.com/autos heaters in the first and second rows; a power liftgate and driver’s driver’s knee air bag; a color touch screen with backup camera and BlueLink telematics system. For $2,900, the Technology package adds an excellent navigation system, system, 550-watt Infinity audio, panoramic panoramic sunroof, heated steering wheel and side-window shades. As for the regular-inseam version, version, the Santa Fe Sport starts at $25,555 with a 190-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder. Adding $3,250 delivers a 2-liter turbo 4 that makes 264 horses. One thing goes missing from either Santa Fe: The strong lines and unmistakable personality of say, the Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Hyundai’s P.T.A.approved P.T.A.approved shape is attractive enough, with its upward sweep and tasteful chrome detailing, but it makes barely a ripple — a bit of a letdown after the go-for-it waves of the Sonata, Elantra and even Accent models. Nor does the Hyundai strike the manly, outdoorsy pose of models like the Pathfinder. Yet the Hyundai is the kind of pleasant, pleasant, unpretentious company that families like to have around. That companionship will set you back $29,455 to start for the three-row Santa Fe. From a $33,945 base price, my front-drive Limited model reached $36,980. Hyundai figures that undercuts a comparable Toyota, Nissan or Honda by $1,500 to $1,900. It’s taken Hyundai more than a decade to get the Santa Fe right, from humble beginnings as a weird, warty side show among compact S.U.V.’s. Now Hyundai is offering a brother act. The Santa Fe Sport trains its sights on best-selling compacts like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4. And as a muscular, legitimate midsize crossover, the Santa Fe gives both families and Hyundai plenty of room to grow.",9/29/2013,"('by', 'the', 'gentrification')","('conventional', 'pickups', 'including')","[' The Avalanche was undone by the gentrification gentrification of conventional pickups, including Chevy’s own Silverado.']", The Avalanche was undone by the gentrification gentrification of conventional pickups including Chevys own Silverado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By LISA PREVOST New guidelines from the Consumer Financial Financial Protection Bureau are aimed at preventing preventing mortgage servicers from unnecessarily unnecessarily foreclosing on homes after a borrower borrower dies. The guidelines, issued last month, come in response to complaints that servicers arc failing to work with survivors who want to assume the loan for a property to which they have claim. “There were concerns about servicers refusing to talk to family members, or demanding demanding documents that basically didn’t exist,” said Kelly Cochran, the bureau’s assistant assistant director for the office of regulations. regulations. Diane Thompson, a lawyer at the National National Consumer Law Center, says the matter is “one of the thorniest and most intransigent intransigent problems I hear about from attorneys attorneys across the country.” Servicers are making “judgment calls” about the legal requirements without any real knowledge, she said. And lost documents documents are the norm. Grieving family members members arc frequently asked to provide the borrower’s death certificate multiple times, for example, before the servicer recognizes recognizes the death. Surviving spouses who want to stay in their home can run into difficulties if they need a loan modification to afford the payments, payments, Ms. Thompson said. Lenders arc often unwilling to allow spouses to assume the mortgage unless they arc current on their payments, but making these payments payments may be impossible for a survivor dealing with large medical and funeral bills.

And they need to do it as soon as they can.” THE DETAILS What You’ll Find Central Park North, also called West 110th Street, is bookended by circles, each commanded by a monument to an African-American African-American legend. At the park’s northwest northwest corner, the abolitionist Frederick Frederick Douglass gazes northward up the gentrifying boulevard that bears his name. At the northeast corner, the jazz composer Duke Ellington looks east past One Museum Museum Mile, a Fifth Avenue luxury condo designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects, and toward a public housing development. The uptown side of Central Park North is lined primarily by lowslung lowslung prewar apartments, many of them rent-stabilized. The street level of No. Ill is home to the Cooper-Hcwitt Cooper-Hcwitt Design Center, as well as a Dunkin’ Donuts. The area’s population, historically historically dominated by blacks, has diversified diversified at an even faster clip than Central Harlem as a whole. A 2007-to-2011 census survey estimated estimated that 6,489 people lived in an area comprising the blocks along northern Central Park and a small wedge of land running north from there to 114th Street west of Lenox. Half of these residents were black, a 17 percent drop since 2000. In that time, the white population nearly quadrupled, to 19 percent; the share of Asians grew to5 percent; that of Hispanics Hispanics dropped slightly, to 23 percent. But long before the gentrification gentrification of the 1990s, Central Park North was known as a more stable strip than the streets above it, said Larry Young, a Central Park North resident who grew up on 111th in the 1960s. Mr. Young, a program director for a nonprofit, recalled that back then kids from 111th or 112th played football in the street against 110th Street kids, whom he describes as typically better educated, with parents in better jobs, often the Civil Service. Later, into the early ’80s, when Harlem in general grew more troubled, ?drugs didn’t go so much in that part of town,” he said of Central Park North. ?The families families were more together, and even now it’s family-oriented.” Residents often say that Central Park feels like their backyard. The street lacks the crowds and traffic of counterpart boulevards on its other sides, and at the Farmers’ Gate at Lenox Avenue and the Warriors’ Gate at Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, the park throws its arms open wide. “I never feel it’s garbagey, and I never feel unsafe; it’s just picturesque,” picturesque,” said Ellen AnthonyMoore, AnthonyMoore, a professor who has lived on Central Park North since 1999. “There arc a lot of international families and a lot of people from Columbia University, and it just feels very down-to-earth.” What You’ll Pay Inventory is low — a search on Streeteasy.com found just two units for sale and five for rent. No units have changed hands this year at 111 Central Park North; in 2012,three-bedrooms there traded for an average of $1,100 a square foot. At No. 201, a first-floor condo sold in July for $629 a square foot. “People arc paying a premium to live on that street,? said Chuck Newman, an agent at Reliance Realty Partners. But rental prices arc wildly variable. Two-bedrooms Two-bedrooms in No. 111 are commanding $7,000 to $7,900 a month — “downtown “downtown prices? — said Jeffrey Berger Berger of Iscn ? Company, a real estate estate advisory firm. At No. 125, a two-bedroom was listed at $4,000. But in some buildings, three-bedrooms three-bedrooms can be had for $3,000. What to Do Restaurants and lounges like Bier International and 67 Orange Street have popped up on Frederick Frederick Douglass Boulevard, filling a neighborhood need. The Conservatory Garden, whose chrysanthemums are a riot of color in fall, is a short walk. Weeping willows overhang the sinuous shores of the Harlem Mecr; Canada geese frequent its waters, and children fish with poles and bait provided free at the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center. Center. Two playgrounds are nestled near Central Park North. At the Harlem Mccr Performance Performance Festival each summer, picnickers picnickers enjoy jazz and other music. music. Nearby, Lasker Rink becomes a public pool in the summer. The Schools Some students are zoned for Public Public School 185 on West 112th Street, for prekindergarten through second second grade, and P.S. 208 on West 111th, for Grades 3 through 5. Both scored Bs on their most recent city progress reports. The Frederick Douglass Academy Academy 11 Secondary School on West 114th serves Grades 6 through 12. SAT averages at the high school in 2012 were 356 in reading, 379 in math and 361 in writing, versus 434,461 and 430 citywidc. The Commute The financial district is about 35 minutes away on the 2 or 3 train, both of which stop at 110th and Lenox.

He uses them to woo an American woman (Rachel McAdams) McAdams) and to ensure his own continued continued self-satisfaction and the audience’s audience’s intermittently amused boredom. boredom. (A. O. Scott) ★ ‘ALL IS LOST’ (PG-13,1:46) Robert Redford, nameless and all but silent, struggles with the elements after his sailboat is rammed by an errant shipping shipping container somewhere in the Indian Indian Ocean. Directed by J. C. Chandor Chandor (“Margin Call”), this film has the stark power and swift action of a classic classic seafaring tale, but it is also a moving moving and subtle allegory of human existence existence in the modern world. (Scott) ‘THE BEST MAN HOLIDAY’ (R, 2:03) The v/riter-director Malcolm D. Lee gathers the crew of friends from his 1999 debut, “The Best Man,? for a Christmas reunion. If the movie’s soapy dramas feel predictable and tilted against the women, the appeal of the cast (which includes Taye Diggs, Monica Calhoun and Terrence Howard) helps. And Mr. Lee’s film is more traditional than its sexually frank humor might indicate, with faith and friendship ultimately given pride of place, right alongside human pettiness. (Nicolas Rapold) ★ ‘BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR* (NC-17,2:59, in French) This wrenching wrenching and enthralling love story — winner winner of the Palme d’Or in Cannes — is already notorious for the sex scenes between its two lead actresses, Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux. But the film’s real glory is its emotional immediacy. Following its main character, character, Adele (Ms. Exarchopoulos) from adolescence into adulthood, the director, Abdellatif Kechiche, tracks the awakening of her consciousness with exquisite empathy. He also, perhaps perhaps more remarkably, grounds her emerging sexuality within a precisely precisely rendered tableau of contemporary France, where traditional republican ideals co-exist with multicultural realities. realities. (Scott) ‘THE BOOK THIEF’ (PG-13,2:05) This shameless piece of Oscar-seeking Holocaust kitsch, adapted from Markus Markus Zusak’s immensely popular young adult novel, is too sweet by half. (Stephen Holden) ‘THE BROKEN CIRCLE BREAKDOWN’ (No rating, 1:50, in Flemish) Felix van Groeningen directed this touching touching love story and soggy family melodrama, melodrama, which opens with a tattoo artist artist (Veerle Baetens) and a bluegrass musician (Johan Heldenbergh) learning that their young daughter has cancer. The ink, the toe-tapping tunes and the Belgian location give this familiar story an air of exoticism while the narrative shuffling suggests suggests there’s far more here than meets the eye. (Manohla Dargis) •CAPTAIN PHILLIPS? (PG-13,2:14) In his latest, the director Paul Greengrass Greengrass revisits the true story of Richard Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), an American American taken hostage in 2009 by Somalis who commandeered his cargo ship in the Indian Ocean. Surprising and satisfyingly satisfyingly complex, it opens as a tale of men and work, then revs up into a camera-shuddering thriller, only to KARSTI’.N MORAN FOR Till: NEW YORK TIMES * TROMBONE FOR LOVERS: A 78TH BIRTHDAY CONCERT AND BENEFIT FOR ROSWELL RUDD (Sunday) The trombonist Roswell Rudd, above, who made his name in the avant-garde stir of the 1960s and has rumbled around contentedly since, has a new album, “Trombone for Lovers,” chock-full of refurbished pop standards. It’s also full of guests, including those found here: the trumpeter Steven Bernstein; the guitarists Gary Lucas and Rolf Sturm; the keyboardist John Medeski; the singers Bob Dorough, Fay Victor and Heather Masse; and the NYC Labor Chorus.

It’s a tough, political look at power and the wretched of the earth. (Dargis) ★ ‘THE COUNSELOR? ( R, 1:51) This terrifying, implacable movie from Ridley Scott follows a corrupt, highflying highflying Texas lawyer (Michael Fassbender) Fassbender) who’s struck a deal with a cartel. Characters fall in American cinema, few as mercilessly or memorably memorably as those in this movie, a tale of good and evil, but because it was written by Cormac McCarthy, mostly evil. The very good cast includes Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt and Cameron Cameron Diaz. (Dargis) ‘DALLAS BUYERS CLUB? (R, 2:00) Matthew McConaughey brings terrific terrific energy to the role of Ron Woodroof, a Texan who receives a diagnosis of H.l.V. in the mid-1980s. The film, directed directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, chronicles chronicles Ron’s transformation from a homophobic hedonist into a medical crusader, bringing experimental (and at the time unapproved) drugs to desperate patients. It is an inspiring inspiring story, but the movie, Mr. McConaughey’s performance notwithstanding, notwithstanding, is too predictable and conventional to do justice to its political political and social dimensions. (Scott) •ENDER’S GAME’ (PG-13,1:54) Based on the 1985 science-fiction novel by Orson Scott Card, this humorless if watchable movie envisions a future world ruled by a monolithic militaristic militaristic government that trains children to fight large insectlike extraterrestrials extraterrestrials called Formics or buggers. Asa Butterfield plays the wee military genius of the title, and Gavin Hood directs. directs. Harrison Ford and Viola Davis help provide some adult supervision. (Dargis) ★ ‘FAUST* (No rating, 2:14, in German) German) Goethe’s tragedy of unbridled ambition is given a surreal, grotesque grotesque spin by the Russian director Alexander Sokurov. The final film in his “ Men of Power” tetralogy, this is an allegory of power and longing in the form of a head trip, as if Bruegel had made a music video for Richard Strauss. (Scott) ★ ‘GRAVITY’ (PG-13,1:30) Alfonso Cuaron’s gripping, spectacular film about astronauts in peril is less a science-fiction science-fiction story than a lean and simple tale of the struggle to survive. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are the space travelers orbiting the Earth, but the real star is Mr. Cuar6n’s Cuar6n’s breathtaking sense of scale and movement. He also grounds his technical technical bravura in a friendly, low-key humanism, and the result is a movie that is at once cosmic and intimate. (Scott) ★ ‘THE GREAT BEAUTY* (No rating, 2:22, in Italian) This deliriously alive movie from Paolo Sorrentino tells the story of a man, a city, a country and a cinema, though not necessarily in that order. Set in Rome, it follows Jep (a sybarite played with a veneer of wit and fathomless soul by the great actor Toni Servillo), who dances into the story while celebrating his 65th birthday and slowly, stirringly, wakens wakens to the world around him. A mustsee. mustsee. (Dargis) ‘JACKASS PRESENTS: BAD GRANDPA? (R, 1:32) Johnny Knoxville Knoxville roughly doubles his age to play his old-man character, Irving Zisman, Zisman, who takes his grandson (Jackson (Jackson Nicoll) on a cross-country trip. The film is a mix of scripted scenes and hidden-camera pranks and stunts, with the two visiting a real-life bingo parlor, a kiddie beauty pageant and more. The found-footage gimmick gimmick is showing its age, but that won’t stop Mr. Knoxville’s fans from laughing. (Neil Genzlinger) ‘LAST VEGAS’ (PG-13,1:44) Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Michael Douglas and Kevin Kline play four childhood pals who reunite in Sin City to crack mild jokes, ogle younger women and learn late-life lessons. Less dreadful than it sounds, thanks to the professionalism of the cast, which also includes Mary Steenburgen Steenburgen as a lounge singer. (Scott) ★ ‘NEBRASKA* (R, 1:55) Bruce Dern plays Woody King, an aging, stubborn stubborn alcoholic who thinks he’s won a sweepstakes and sets off from his home in Montana to Lincoln, Neb., to claim the prize. Along the way, in the company of his younger son, David (Will Forte), he stops in his hometown, hometown, where his encounters with old friends and sad memories spark a small-town comedy worthy of Preston Preston Sturges. But for all the film’s sharp humor, the director, Alexander Payne, and the writer, Bob Nelson, are attentive to the strains of bitterness bitterness and regret that hover over Woody and his family. The absence of sentimentality makes this black-andwhite black-andwhite portrait of the American dream in retreat all the more moving. (Scott) ‘SUNLIGHT JR.’ (No rating, 1:30) Naomi Naomi Watts and Matt Dillon play a down-and-out working-class couple facing multiple problems that include homelessness, disablement, unemployment, unemployment, alcoholism and pregnancy. (Holden) ‘THOR: THE DARK WORLD’ (PG-13, 1:52) Alan Taylor?s witless entry in the continuing saga of the repackaged repackaged Norse god with the Popeye arms and the really big mallet flits awkwardly between a dank, depopulated depopulated London and the organ-pipe architecture architecture of Asgard, helped not at all by disorienting 3-D and a leading lady (Natalie Portman) who spends an inordinate amount of time in a dead faint. (Jeannette Catsoulis) ★ ‘12 YEARS A SLAVE’ (R, 2:14) Written by John Ridley and directed by Steve McQueen, “12 Years a Slave” tells the true story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an African-American African-American freeman who, in 1841, was snatched off the streets of Washington. Washington. and sold. It’s at once a familiar, familiar, utterly strange and deeply American American story in which the period trappings trappings long beloved by Hollywood — the paternalistic gentry with their pretty plantations, their genteel manners manners and all the fiddle-dee-dee rest — are the backdrop for an outrage. Essential Essential viewing. (Dargis) •WADJDA’ (PG, 1:37) Haifaa al-Mansour’s al-Mansour’s touching film, the first feature directed by a Saudi woman, tells the story of Wadjda (Waad Mohammed), a 10-year-old struggling with the restrictions restrictions placed on her by religion and tradition.

Dinkins and Mayor Edward Koch drew nearly one million voters The general election in which Mr Dinkins beat Rudolph Giuliani Republican drew 1.8 million voters New York City's population has grown by

Salvation Soldier Anthony CODY gained the nickname Tony Bargains after cleaning out a crack house on Boston Road in the Allcrton section of the Bronx and opening Tony’s Bargain Basement Thrift Shop. The shop is wedged between a shuttered Chinese restaurant and a closed carwash, and it is not much more impressive, housed in a vacant apartment, with handwritten handwritten signs and idiosyncratically displayed displayed merchandise. Shirts arc hung on the telephone pole out front. Slightly worn shoes and preowned preowned handbags are displayed on wood shelves built by Mr. Cody to stretch out to the sidewalk. Inside, unkempt racks of clothing fill the store, occupying the first floor of a two-story house. Mr. Cody, 48, lives upstairs. “I can’t even afford to heat the store,” said Mr. Cody, who each morning takes the padlocks off the front door and pulls out bins of clothing and other items. He spends a couple of hours setting up his outdoor showroom and then remains a fixture out front, because his focus is not on sales but rather on those in need.

A forest of question marks rises around the new mayor. He was a political operative, operative, a public advocate with little power and a Council member who stood in the liberal liberal mainstream. Now he carries a standard standard for urban progressives. What is the nature nature of his vision? There is more at stake than his success or failure. New York City has taken its place in a row of global jewels: Paris, London, London, Los Angeles and Berlin. Turbocharged Turbocharged attention to wealth and privilege has become central to how these cities define define their economic advantage. In this city, inequality has reached appalling appalling levels, and a growing body of research research finds that the chasm could poison economic growth.

Put to the side esoteric questions of whether there can be progressive garbage collection or firefighting. Defining the word “progressive” can prove elusive. New York progressives share a traditional-left traditional-left concern with class, labor unions and higher wage standards. Mr. de Blasio nods to this when he speaks in support of organizing fast-food and carwash workers. But progressives, particularly Mr. dc Blasio, do not share the old New Left’s penetrating critique of American society. Many distinguish between their interests and those of municipal labor. And the new mayor is careful to note that he so far proposes proposes just a single tax increase — to support support universal prekindergarten. He was also careful to share postclcction laughs with real estate barons. Lonnie Soury, a former Dinkins administration administration official sympathetic to the dc Blasio agenda, noted that President Lyndon B. Johnson proposed prekindergarten a halfcentury halfcentury ago. “It’s a measure of how far our politics have drifted to the right that this now establishes Bill’s left-wing bona centers, he said. If someone is particularly desperate, and promises to avoid drugs and alcohol, Mr. Cody will open up his spare bedroom, he said. “This place is my calling,” he said. “Around here, there’s really very little help for these people.” His cellphone number is scrawled all over the front of the shop, and he is constantly constantly fielding calls from people in crisis and those seeking to donate items. Mr. Cody grew up largely in this neighborhood, neighborhood, raised by his grandmother.

He began using and selling drugs, and he wound up spending much of his 20s and 30s in prison.

He befriended befriended the owner of this two-family house, which had been occupied and trashed by drug users and scavenged of much of its plumbing. Mr. Cody cleaned up the place, installed a series of garden hoses as makeshift pipes and brought in propane heaters to warm it.

With the building now in receivership, Mr. Cody, who no longer pays rent, is facing facing eviction. He hopes to raise enough money to incorporate as a nonprofit and to move his operation into a storefront across the street, he said. To this end, he is constantly lobbying local local businesses for donations, and handing out fliers. And in the evening, he makes some money delivering Chinese food on a motorized bicycle. The store is his own salvation, he said, a reminder of his mistakes and a caution against relapsing into drug addiction. ?It keeps me dean and sober, because it helps keep my own mistakes fresh in my mind,” Mr. Cody said between trips upstairs to make salami sandwiches to hand out. “Some of the people I serve arc kooks,? he said. “But you know what? I used to be a kook.” He and Ms. Fcincr, who grew up in an Upper East Side penthouse, make a quirky couple. “We don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring, so we’re doing it today,” Mr. Cody said. ?Helping people is my payment.

Quite a few members of the liberal gentry labored in the Bloomberg administration, but few were Latino or black, and fewer still were working-class. Mr. de Blasio insists that his administration will look and sound like the city. It is no accident that he has picked three Hispanic women, all respected government government hands, for high-ranking slots: Lilliam Barrios-Paoli as deputy mayor for health and human services, Gladys Carrion as child welfare commissioner and Carmen Farina as schools chancellor. And he has picked a black former prosecutor, Zachary W.

One of those apps, CalCutter, would seem a great download for this time of year, both to celebrate the now-concluded tenure of that most health-conscious of mayors and to aid in that ubiquitous resolution resolution for a healthier diet. CalCutter tries to help users find less caloric alternatives to their favorite recipes. After you enter the ingredients to any particular particular recipe, the app recommends recommends alternatives with fewer calorics — ideas that, in the best possible world, would taste just as good as the originals. I was interested in how CalCutter CalCutter might help me make peanut butter bars a mite less terrible for me than I know they arc.

Elected officials speak excitedly of a progressive moment, but moments can vanish quickly. the early 1980s and about 2000), whose leftwing leftwing populism gave rise to Occupy Wall Street. It is, Mr. Bcinart wrote, remaking the Democratic Party. Amid the huzzahs, keep a desultory fact in mind: Fewer than 25 percent of registered registered voters cast ballots in the mayoral election, a record poor turnout. An exit poll by Edison Research found that nearly twothirds twothirds of the voters were 45 or older. If you overlay the map of 2013 on that of 2009, you sec that many tens of thousands of New Yorkers who supported Mayor Bloomberg voted for Mr. dc Blasio. That so many forded this ideological brook suggests suggests more continuity than progressives might imagine. Last, it?s instructive to compare the 1989 election of David N. Dinkins, the city’s first black mayor and the inheritor of a liberal populist movement, with that of Mr. de Blasio, who as a young man worked for Mayor Dinkins. The Democratic primary in 1989 between between Mr. Dinkins and Mayor Edward I. Koch drew nearly one million voters. The general election, in which Mr. Dinkins beat Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, drew 1.8 million voters. New York City’s population has grown by one million people since those elections. Yet 700,000 fewer New Yorkers voted in the general election of 2013. Mr. dc Blasio will lay claim to a mandate for change. But his election offers a more modest lesson in popular and generational mobilization than his oratory suggests. Progressives did not create our torpid democracy. But it’s their inheritance. AGAIN AND AGAIN, elected officials speak, almost giddily, of their progressive moment. moment. “Today we commit to a new progressive progressive direction in New York, “ Mr. dc Blasio said at his inauguration. ?And that same progressive impulse has written our city’s history. It’s in our DNA.? But moments can prove evanescent. It has been two decades since New York’s progressives held the wheel of power. Should they fumble, the wilderness beckons. The new mayor’s greatest challenge is to handle his putative allies in the municipal municipal labor movement. The former mayor left behind expired contracts like a pile of dirty laundry. If Mr. dc Blasio miscalculates, miscalculates, settling those contracts could empty his coffers. And with that we circle back to the most intriguing question: Who is this new selfstyled selfstyled progressive mayor? He proved to be a masterful tactician, enlisting his family in choreographed commercials. commercials. He played political boss, and he has raised expectations. Now, alone on the stage, he must define himself and that progressive progressive movement. “Bill de Blasio probably doesn’t know precisely who Bill dc Blasio is just yet,? a long-serving liberal said. “He’s going to find out, and my guess is that he’s got a window of months, not years.” were not listed. But no peanut butter? butter? Is it possible the superfood is so caloric that the app simply doesn’t list it on principle? Looking up the calorie information information for multiple ingredients was mildly irritating, but I thought it might be worth it if CalCutter could offer some way for me to bake the beloved bars without packing on pounds. No such luck. Once I completed work on the recipe and pressed the magic button, button, the app gave me this advice: “Consider reducing amount of chocolate chips, semisweet; butter; butter; peanut butter; and sugar, confectioner’s.” Removing even a smidgen of any of those ingredients would, of course, ruin everything. But it’s not only peanut butter bars that stump CalCutter. Recipes for Lebanese Lebanese chicken and lentil stew similarly similarly focused on calorie reduction above all else. Only when I put in the recipe for the Barefoot Contessa’s Contessa’s oven-fried chicken was 1 given given advice that strayed from the “less food = fewer calories? template. template. And the suggestion to consider consider not frying the fried chicken was not particularly helpful. CalCutter is a somewhat useful app for storing recipes and reminding reminding yourself that maybe a single stick of butter will do. But in its single-minded focus on the amount of food that users arc eating, eating, CalCutter misses out on nutrients, nutrients, diversity and other factors that contribute to a healthy diet. It also discounts factors like the user’s weight and age, and it has not provided original healthful recipes of its own. Many apps look to own the space in which they operate, operate, but CalCutter docs not even succeed in thoroughly accomplishing accomplishing its stated mission. It’s more of an ad for a tech-savvy governmental department than a useful piece of software. JONAH BROMWICH Have a favorite New York City app?

2292,1932859035,"From top, Fatih Mosque; inside Orhan Pamuk’s Museum of Innocence, based on his novel of that title; a cafe in the Cihangir neighborhood. Orhan Pamuk’s Istanbul CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 Mr. Pamuk during the off-season, given his focus in books like “Snow” and “Istanbul” on winter, grayncss and melancholy. The air was crisp, the light was muted, and although although the sun occasionally burst through the clouds, the city seemed largely drained of color. “I have always preferred the winter winter to the summer in Istanbul,” Mr. Pamuk wrote in “Istanbul.” “I love the early evenings evenings when autumn is slipping into winter, when the leafless trees are trembling in the north wind, and people in black coats and jackets arc rushing home through the darkening streets.” From the balcony of his apartment, he looked approvingly at the sun shining weakly through the cloud cover and pronounced it an optimal day for a walk. “If this was a hugely sunny day I would be upset,” he said. “I like the black and white city as I wrote in ‘Istanbul.’” I had caught up with him during the last stages of polishing his new novel, “A Strangeness in My Mind,” to be published in English in 2015, chronicling the life of an Istanbul street vendor from the 1970s to the present. He told me that he was grateful grateful for a break. “I am an obsessive about my work, but I love it,” he said. He put on a trench coat and pulled a black baseball cap over his brow, a halfhearted effort to render render himself a little less recognizable. In 2005, Mr. Pamuk responded to an interviewer’s interviewer’s question about a crackdown on freedom of expression in Turkey by asserting asserting that “a million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in this country and I’m the only one who dares to talk about it.” The offhand remark, published in a Swiss newspaper, resulted in death threats, vilification in the Turkish press and charges by an Istanbul public prosecutor prosecutor of the “public denigration of Turkish identity.? Mr. Pamuk was forced to flee the country for nearly a year — his longest time out of Turkey. The charges were abandoned in January 2006 amid an international international outcry, and the threats have subsided. Though Mr. Pamuk sometimes travels with bodyguards, especially during his nocturnal rambles, he now feels relatively relatively safe. On this cloudy afternoon we followed a zigzag route that roughly paralleled the Bosporus and took us through the heart of Cihangir, once a predominantly Greek neighborhood. In the 1960s, when Mr. Pamuk was a student at the elite Robert College prep school farther up the Bosporus, Bosporus, rising nationalistic fervor over a looming looming conflict in Cyprus came to a climax in the government’s eviction of the neighborhood’s neighborhood’s Greek population. Deprived of its commercial class, Cihangir became the city’s red-light district. “I wrote an early novel here in the 1970s, in my grandfather’s apartment,? Mr. Pamuk said. “Every night, I used to wake up to women and their bodyguards — their macho protectors — and their clients, bargaining, bargaining, throwing belts out the window.? Cihangir is now a trendy neighborhood of artists and writers, elegant cafes, antiJOSHUA antiJOSHUA HAMMER is a frequent contributor to Travel. His next book, ?Taking Timbuktu,? will be published by Simon ? Schuster in 2015. quarian shops and sky-high rents. One engine of Cihangir’s revitalization is Mr. Pamuk’s own creation: the Museum of Innocence, which opened in 2012 in a burgundy burgundy building on a steep road leading down to the curving Golden Horn, which connects the Bosporus to the Sea of Marmara. Marmara. The museum is a meticulously rendered rendered time capsule of 1970s Istanbul, and a tribute to the power of obsession. It was inspired inspired by Mr. Pamuk’s 2008 novel “The Museum of Innocence,” about an affluent Istanbul businessman, Kcmal Basmaci, who falls in love with a poor shopgirl, Fusun, and becomes so consumed that he assembles a collection of every trace of contact with her. Mr. Pamuk found the building himself, designed the exhibits and assembled his character’s fictional collection from flea markets and his own family heirlooms. Glass cases on the walls in darkened rooms arc arranged chapter by chapter, filled with these supposed tokens of his character’s mostly unrequited love: crystal crystal bottles of cologne, porcelain dogs, Istanbul Istanbul postcards and 4,213 of Fusun’s cigarette cigarette butts, each one encased behind its own tiny window. “I didn’t publish a novel for years, but I have excuses,” Mr. Pamuk told me. “I did a museum in between.” KARAKOY SQUARE, farther down the hill, is a waterfront plaza radiating outward into avenues lined with modem and Ottomanera Ottomanera office buildings, food bazaars and appliance appliance shops. Street vendors sell pomegranate pomegranate juice and simit, the wheel-like bread otherwise known as a Turkish bagel. Tucked off one steep avenue is an alley of government-sanctioned brothels guarded guarded by the police. The Karakoy area conjures conjures vivid memories for Mr. Pamuk of his childhood. He pointed out a row of bicycle shops, where his father bought him his first two-wheeler. A bit farther on is a passageway passageway leading to the Tunel, one of the world’s oldest subterranean transit lines. The two-stop subway, built by French engineers, engineers, began in 1875 and still links Karakoy Karakoy Square with the embassy district in the central Beyoglu district. In its early incarnation incarnation the train consisted of a steam engine engine that pulled two wooden cars, with separate separate compartments for men and women. “The empire fell apart, and there was no other subway line in Turkey for 120 more years,” said Mr. Pamuk, who loved riding the trains with his parents as a child. We stopped for lunch in the shadow of the Galata Bridge, a double-decker concrctc-and-stccl concrctc-and-stccl span, opened in 1994, with walkways, three lanes of traffic in each direction direction and tram tracks. Plastic tables and chairs stood haphazardly on a muddy patch near the water, flanked by portable grills selling fish fillets on baguettes, garnished garnished with paprika, chile powder and chopped vegetables. A stray dog, his car tagged as proof of his government-issued rabies shot, lay in the dirt. “He’s a local monument,? said Mr. Pamuk, who was bitten bitten by a street dog during an evening walk 13 years ago and had to undergo a painful scries of rabies shots. Across the inlet, in stunning contrast to the scruffy surroundings, rose the silver W? WihA?E JAQT IKS K ?K TIIK NKW YORK TIMES Top, the Golden Horn connects the Bosporus to the Sea of Marmara. Above, clockwise from u[ drink called boza, is a favorite stop for Mr. Pamuk; secondhand books for sale at Sahaflar Car: dome of Hagia Sophia, wreathed in limestone limestone and sandstone minarets. Built as a Greek Orthodox basilica and opened in A.D. 537 and converted into a mosque after the 1453 Islamic conquest of Constantinople, Constantinople, it was secularized by Kcmal Ataturk, Ataturk, modern Turkey’s founder, and turned into a museum in 1935. “I had little interest in Byzantium as a child,” Mr. Pamuk wrote in “Istanbul.? “I associated the word with spooky, bearded, black-robed Greek Orthodox priests, with the aqueducts that still ran through the city, with Hagia Sophia and the red-brick walls of old churches.” Legal disputes have kept this patch of waterfront property, where we were eating lunch, in limlx), resulting resulting in a rare zone of neglect in the heart of the city. It’s one of Mr. Pamuk’s favorite favorite places. “All my childhood was like this, but will it be like this in 20 years? No way,” he told me, as we savored the maritime maritime smells. He is all but certain that the rapid gentrification of surrounding neighborhoods neighborhoods will eventually overtake this forgotten forgotten field. WE continued across the Galata Bridge, the historic epicenter of Istanbul, stopping midway to admire the scene: tourist boats and pleasure craft floated down the Golden Horn, past the mosques of Sultan Ahmet on one side and the steep hills of Cihangir on the other. “This was originally a wooden wooden bridge, and when I was growing up you had to pay to cross it,” he said, “but you could also hire row boats.

3807,1943326786,"Orhan Pamuk's Istanbul   deeply personal tour by man whose writing is steeped in the city   By JOSHUA HAMMER   On windswept afternoon in mid-December the writer Orhan Pamuk stood in leafy square around the corner from Istanbul University absorbed in 40-year-old memory He walked past parked   cycles sturdy oaks and stone fountain browsing through secondhand books in front of cluttered shops occupying the bot tom floors of quadrangle of pale yellow buildings Sahaflar Carsisi Istanbul's used-book bazaar has been magnet for literary types since the Byzantine era In the early 1970s, Mr Pamuk then an architecture student and aspiring painter with love for Western literature would drive from his home across the Golden Horn to shop for Turkish translations of Thomas Mann Andre Gide and other Eu ropean authors My father was nice in giving me money and would come here on Saturday mornings in his car and fill the trunk with books the Nobel Laureate re membered standing beside bust of Ybra- him Muteferrika who printed one of the first books in Turkey an Arabic-Turkish language dictionary in 1732. Nobody else would be here on Satur days I'd be haggling talking chatting would know every clerk but it s all changed now he said referring to the somewhat touristy atmosphere and the disappearance of characters he d come to know such as manuscript seller who doubled as Sufi preacher These days he said come only once year Mr Pamuk was born about three and half miles from the market in the prosper ous Nisantasi neighborhood in 1952, the son of businessman who frittered away much of his fortune through series of bad investments Mr Pamuk grew up sur rounded by relatives and servants but quarrels between his mother and father and the ever-present sense of family un raveling cast his youth into uncertainty and periodic sadness For most of the six decades since Mr Pamuk has lived in Istanbul both in Ni and nearby Cihangir alongside the Bosporus His work is as grounded in the city as Dickens's was in London and Naguib Mahfouz's was in Cairo Novels such as The Museum of Innocence and The Black Book and the ical Istanbul Memories and the City evoke both magical city and melan choly one reeling from the loss of empire torn by the clash between secularism and political Islam and seduced by the West Most of Mr Pamuk's characters are mem bers of the secular elite whose love affairs feuds and obsessions play out in the cafes and bedrooms of few neighborhoods did my first foreign travel in 1959, when went to Geneva for the summer with my father and didn't leave Istanbul again until 1982,"" Mr Pamuk told me be long to this city Last fall emailed Mr Pamuk and asked him if he would take me on tour of the neighborhoods that shaped his up bringing and his development as writer After many visits wanted to get beyond the tourist sights and observe the city as he sees it place of epic history and deep personal associations Mr Pamuk readily agreed and two months later met him at his apartment in the affluent Cihan gir quarter overlooking the Cihangir Mosque 16th-century monolith

neighborhood of Is near the Golden Horn   AYMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES   Orhan Pamuk's Istanbul   CONTINUED FROM PAGE Mr Pamuk during the off-season given his focus in books like Snow and Istanbul on winter grayness and melancholy The air was crisp the light was muted and al though the sun occasionally burst through the clouds the city seemed largely drained of color have always preferred the win ter to the summer in Istanbul Mr Pamuk wrote in Istanbul love the early eve nings when autumn is slipping into winter when the leafless trees are trembling in the north wind and people in black coats and jackets are rushing home through the darkening streets From the balcony of his apartment he looked approvingly at the sun shining weakly through the cloud cover and pronounced it an optimal day for walk If this was hugely sunny day would be upset he said like the black and white city as wrote in 'Istanbul had caught up with him during the last stages of polishing his new novel Strangeness in

love it he said He put on trench coat and pulled black baseball cap over his brow halfhearted effort to ren der himself little less recognizable In 2005, Mr Pamuk responded to an in  s question about crackdown on freedom of expression in Turkey by as serting that million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in this country and I'm the only one who dares to talk about it The offhand remark published in Swiss newspaper resulted in death threats vilification in the Turkish press and charges by an Istanbul public prosecu tor of the public denigration of Turkish identity Mr Pamuk was forced to flee the country for nearly year his longest time out of Turkey The charges were abandoned in January 2006 amid an in ternational outcry and the threats have subsided Though Mr Pamuk sometimes travels with bodyguards especially during his nocturnal rambles he now feels rela tively safe On this cloudy afternoon we followed zigzag route that roughly paralleled the Bosporus and took us through the heart of Cihangir once predominantly Greek neighborhood In the 1960s, when Mr Pamuk was student at the elite Robert College prep school farther up the Bospo rus rising nationalistic fervor over loom ing conflict in Cyprus came to climax in the government s eviction of the neigh borhood s Greek population Deprived of its commercial class Cihangir the city s red-light district wrote an early

the window Cihangir is now trendy neighborhood of artists and writers elegant cafes anti   shops and sky-high rents One engine of Cihangir's revitalization is Mr Pamuk's own creation the Museum of Innocence which opened in 2012 in bur gundy building on steep road leading down to the curving Golden Horn which connects the Bosporus to the Sea of Mar mara The museum is meticulously ren dered time capsule of 1970s Istanbul and tribute to the power of obsession It was in spired by Mr Pamuk's 2008 novel The Museum of Innocence about an affluent Istanbul businessman Kemal Basmaci who falls in love with poor shopgirl Fusun and becomes so consumed that he assembles collection of every trace of contact with her Mr Pamuk found the building himself designed the exhibits and assembled his character s

the 47 percent inequality or envy diversity or op   portunity than about labor wealth and power But maybe Brooklyn is place to start and perhaps culture rather than politics is more fruitful area of investiga tion The name of New York's most pop ulous borough does not signify what it used to and embedded in that change of meaning are some clues about the current state of our old friends the cultural contra dictions of capitalism The new Brooklyn is easily mocked and almost as easily embraced as Uto pia of beards tattoos fixed-gear bikes and do-it-yourself commerce Everyone is busy knitting raising chickens distilling whis   key making art and displaying the fruits of this activity in pop-up galleries and bou tiques farm-to- kitchens and temples of mixology Brooklyn might as well be synonym for the Portland of Portlandia or for the sweet silly self-important stuff- -people-like Gestalt that television has come to represent Its ethic is both countercultural and entrepreneurial offering an aesthetic of radicalism without the difficult commitment of radical politics The tension built into the Brooklyn brand is that it s both local artisanal communal protest against the ing forces of corporate culture and new way of being bourgeois and as such par ticipating in the destruction of non-middle- class social space Its rebellious energies are focused largely on restaurants retail and real estate Not everyone in Brooklyn has chin- strap beard or sleeve tattoo or home bacon-curing operation of course but with remarkable speed this image of county of 2.5

my own grand parents held similar jobs and where my mother and most of her numerous cousins had grown up itching to be elsewhere Nowadays Brooklyn is represented on television by Girls in which it

1228,1943323222,"Kurt Cobain Slept Here   WASHINGTON STATE   quest to understand the life and death of rock legend where he lived and played   By DAVE SEMINARA   Kurt Cobain felt bored and old Teenage angst had paid off well as the line in the Nirvana song Serve the Servants put it but the fame that came with being the frontman of the seminal grunge band that brought punk to the mainstream was taking toll Cobain was considered by many to be the voice of his generation but he   was also battling depression and addiction diseases that led to his suicide at 27. was 21-year-old college student at the time and one my fellow DJ 's at our col lege radio station at Villanova   University relayed the grim news We took to the airwaves playing our favorite Nir vana songs and mourning the loss with pony kegs of the best beer we could afford In the 20 years since Cobain died Nirva na s music has stayed with me flashing back at me in waves poignant reminders of my own 20s. When read that Cobain's hometown Aberdeen was planning day to honor him in February in advance of the 20-year- anniversary of his death on April 5, 1994, and that Nirvana was being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April the reality that one of my favorite mu sicians has now been dead for two decades was unsettling had wanted to make trip to Washington State to see where he came from and what influenced him CONTINUED ON PAGE 10   Kurt Cobain at right with the original members of Nirvana in Bainbridge Island Wash in 1989.

using Heavier Than Heaven Charles Cross's masterful Cobain biography to create an itinerary that hoped would give me better un derstanding of Cobain and his music started my cobain trip at the Marco Polo no-frills motel on the gritty periph ery of Seattle that Cobain frequented in his final days when his heroin addiction con trolled his life According to the 2007 BBC documentary The Last 48 Hours of Kurt Cobain Cobain used to duck out of his mansion in the exclusive Denny-Blaine neighborhood to meet one of his preferred heroin dealers along Aurora Avenue He would then retreat to room 226 of the Mar co Polo to shoot up The reception area was closed when arrived late on Monday night in Febru ary so 1 rang the doorbell Moments later small sliding window opened and man named Jonathan popped his head out He sized me up wordlessly slid the window shut and re-emerged moments later in the reception area wearing an undershirt pair of boxer shorts and woolly socks This place was the Wild West back when Kurt stayed here he said checking me into Cobain's favorite room as TV blared from his living quarters behind the reception desk We had hookers throwing TVs out the windows here drug dealers junkies you name it Having worked there for many years but not back then he suggested that the neighborhood had improved since Cobain frequented the place but my room was grim time warp There were hairs on the pillows splotchy stains on the sheets that could have predated Nirvana and scratchy bath towels Before buying the expansive home at 171 Lake Washington Boulevard where he was found dead Cobain and his wife Courtney Love lived in variety of high-end Seattle hotels including the Inn at the Market the Sorrento Hotel and the Four Seasons Olympic now the Fairmont Olympic The Fairmont and the other luxury hotels Cobain lived at don't advertise the connec tion but the arty Hotel Max embraces Se attle s grunge connection with Sub Pop floor devoted to the local indie record label that discovered Nirvana Cobain is often linked to Seattle but he spent less than two years living in the city He lived in more than half-dozen homes and slept in countless other places in Aber deen and the neighboring towns of Mon- and Hoquiam and wrote many of Nirvana's best-known songs in Olympia before moving to Seattle in 1992. 1 started my Cobain homes tour in Montesano small town where members of the influ ential punk band the Melvins grew up Standing outside 413 Fleet Street South the home that Cobain lived in with his fa ther from late 1978 to March 1982, was neighbor named John Bell who told me that when Cobain's mom used to visit him he could hear them yelling at each other   from across the street Fleet Street was step up for Cobain but Mr Bell said that the modest century-old house with red vi nyl siding and newspapers covering the windows seemed mostly empty few minutes outside Montesano drove into the Country Estates mobile home park where Cobain lived with his paternal grandfather Leland Cobain after leaving Fleet Street While parked next to speed limit sign that warned Violators will be Prosecuted Survivors will be Shot man named Jerry who was out for walk offered to introduce me to Gary Cobain Leland's son and Kurt's uncle My dad greeted Nirvana fans from all over the world here said Gary Cobain who moved into the mobile home after his father died last May It kept him busy SHADOWING THE CHEHALIS RIVER drove west from Seattle along Olympic Highway to Aberdeen an old logging city once called the roughest town west of the Mis sissippi Before tableau of billowing smokestacks there is sign erected by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Foundation in 2005, that reads Welcome to Aberdeen Come As You Are reference to one of Nirva na s hit singles and now the unofficial mot to of the city The mayor of Aberdeen Bill Simpson had offered to take me on mini-Nirvana tour but the receptionist at city hall said he was helping to negotiate standoff There's some crazy guy holed up in his attic who fired some shots out the window and was making threats she explained Before could tell her not to bother the mayor she had already spoken to him and minutes later he bounded into the room Kurt went to Seattle and became famous but he was from Aberdeen the mayor told me as we piled into his Chrysler minivan Seattle embraced him as one of their own but then he killed himself and suddenly he became an Aberdeen guy again We're happy to reclaim him Wc drove by 1210 East First Street to have look at the home where Cobain lived for several years as child in the city s notorious Felony Flats neighbor hood which is rife with boarded-up homes His mother Wendy O'Connor who now lives in California placed the four-bed room modest home assessed at 67 000 up for sale in September at 500 000 Jaime Dunkle Nirvana fan in Portland Ore is raising money to turn the place into mu seum so it doesn't end up in the clutches of capitalist greed as she put it on her website   real estate agent gave me tour of the home which is being marketed as once in lifetime opportunity to own piece of rock history It was like stroll into 1970s time warp The vintage kitchen fea tured orange black and gold carpeting the hallway had wood shingles and Cobain's bedroom was just as he left it with hole punched in the wall and plenty of graffiti paying homage to bands he liked Led Zeppelin Iron Maiden and perhaps his fa vorite beer Olde English 800. former manager of the men s shoe de partment of Aberdeen's Penney store Mr Simpson 73, isn't in the heart of the Nirvana fan demographic But when 1 di aled up Territorial Pissings the most ag punk Nirvana tunes could find on my iPhone he insisted that he liked it While we were checking out the recently unveiled and much maligned Kurt Cobain statue not-very-flattering rendition of Cobain in ripped jeans with tear falling from one eye at the Aberdeen History Mu seum Mr Simpson took call and relayed the news that the standoff was over Good news the guy surrendered he said Aberdeen's must-see Cobain site is small park opened in 2011 by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Foundation called Kurt Cobain Landing which sits at the foot of the Young Street Bridge the inspiration for the song Something in the Way Cobain claimed that he lived under the bridge for time and while most who knew him don't think he did it was clearly one of his preferred hangouts Set along the banks of the murky Wishkah River the strangely appealing little park features guitar sculpture likeness of Cobain with the lyrics to Something in the Way headstone with some amusing Cobain quotes sample I'm walking bacterial infection Kurt Cobain air guitar sculpture and collage of Nirvana-related graffiti under the bridge itself After the tour checked out host of   Nirvana-related sites including six differ ent homes where he once lived knew that Cobain had grown up poor but seeing all of the places where he lived including Dale Crover's porch at 609 West Second Street where he slept inside re frigerator box for time gave me new appreciation for how much he overcame Surely no one who knew Kurt Cobain then could have predicted that someday he d have two towns fighting to claim him as native son Hoquiam Aberdeen's neighbor and ri val issued proclamation honoring Nirva na in February prompting Aberdeen to reclaim Kurt with Cobain day of its own The home where he lived in Hoquiam from birth until he was 2 looked just as for lorn as most of his residences in Aberdeen but Hoquiam also had an appealing if dat ed little downtown TWO MONTHS AFTER PLAYING their first ever gig at house party in Raymond Cobain left Aberdeen and moved to Olym pia comparatively bohemian oasis where he found his creative muse My first stop was 114 Fear Street small house in central Olympia split into three apart ments where Cobain lived with Tracy Marander his girlfriend at the time She supported him while he wrote many of the songs that would appear on Nevermind They broke up but he kept their tiny apartment until July 1991, when he re turned from doing promotional work in Los Angeles for the forthcoming Never mind to find that he d been evicted his belongings discarded in the street like trash Scott Taylor the lead singer and guitar player for the Hard Way lives in apart ment No 3, where Cobain wrote Nirvana's most recognizable songs and he

346,000 homes in New Jersey But Sandy was not evenhanded in her wrath While whole blocks in Ortlcy Beach were leveled neighboring Midway Beach replete with the very same style of bunga lows survived largely intact While the handsome seaside mansions of Mantolok- ing were gutted nearby Bay Head fared much better Many people credit protec tive armor like sand dunes and sea walls for providing critical cover Rebuilding in high-hazard area is not cheap If house was destroyed or sus tained substantial damage it must be re built to local floodplain requirements which in the most risky areas can require costly measures like elevating the house on pilings or columns Other protections include hurricane- proof windows and breakaway walls which are exterior walls designed to col lapse during severe storm without caus ing damage to the elevated part of the house or to the foundation Homeowners with federally backed mortgages must also buy flood insurance which can be expen sive Owners who can t afford the flood in surance premiums or who can t afford to rebuild to these standards are selling This is now an opportunity to build big ger homes and they are certainly going to have to build them at higher elevation and it s going to cost more said Peter Reinhart the director of the Kislak Real Estate Institute at Monmouth University think we re going to lose some of that blue-collar flavor in the area For Ortley Beach homeowners like John and Gina McConcghy Hurricane Sandy closed chapter on their lives After the storm flooded their 800-square-foot bunga low with 22 inches of water the couple ripped it down to the frame But without flood insurance they could not afford the 400 000 it would have cost to rebuild to floodplain requirements So last February the couple sold their property with views of the bay for 200 000 When you re down there and it s nice day and the sun s out and you hear the ocean you re going to miss it said Mr McConeghy 54-year-old contractor who lives in Wayne But it became busi ness decision I'm not in the financial posi tion to pay that kind of money for sum mer home that only use few months out of the year Prices for waterfront property in hard- hit areas plunged after the storm largely because of damage to houses Suddenly towns where land was rarely available like Mantoloking had listings Of water front homes that sold in the area between November 2012 and June 2013, the median selling price dropped 34 percent from the same time period year earlier according to an analysis of listings data by Tom Wis- scl Multiple Listing Service coordinator for the Ocean County Board of Realtors Buyers who had previously been priced out of the market may now be able to get foothold in town like Mantoloking where house with 70 feet of footage on the ocean sold for 75 million before the storm Af ter the storm similar lot with more than double the footage sold for 75 million In Lavallette lots that listed for 550 000 before the storm now list for 400 000 And in Ortlcy Beach bayside lots that listed for 350 000 before the storm now list for 200 000 according to Birchler Realtors People are starting to say 'Hold it I'm going to miss

confidence in the Jersey Shore but scien tists point out that areas tike the barrier is lands are increasingly vulnerable to coast al flooding as sea levels rise The New York City Panel on Climate Change esti mates that by the 2020s New York City could be beset by 2 to 11 inches of sea level rise And by the 2050s little longer than the length of 30-year mortgage the sea could rise by as much as 31 inches Barrier islands like Long Beach face an other challenge they sit on top of sedi ment that is slowly compacting causing them to sink As the sea level rises the risk of coastal flooding increases even in moderate storm The people who are making these deci sions are taking some real risk said Ben Strauss the director of the Program on Sea Level Rise at Climate Central group that studies the effects of climate change   hope that they are viewing it with their eyes open Flooding is already chronic problem in New Jersey and some wonder if allowing homeowners to rebuild in high-risk areas is good public policy In the past nine years the state has had 11 separate flood ing events that have been severe enough to trigger presidential disaster declara tion Yet the state remains committed to rebuilding rather than encouraging home owners in flood-prone areas to relocate to higher ground Since Sandy New Jersey has provided homeowners with grant money to rebuild and has invested in infrastructure in flood- prone areas like the new Route 35, which was breached during Sandy and Is being rebuilt to withstand 25-year storm 265 million project We as state need to start getting it This is our fate said John Miller wa ter resource engineer and the legislative committee chairman for the New Jersey Association for Floodplain Management We have to start adapting because this is going to happen again The Jersey Shore is integral to the state s economy and to its identity Tour ism accounts for nearly 7 percent of the state s economy and half of the 40 billion-   a-year tourism industry comes from the Shore For people whose families have strolled the boardwalks for years walking away is simply unimaginable But future with rising sea levels is where reality meets the romance of the coast said Robert Freudenberg the New Jersey director of the Regional Plan Association You want to be there you want piece of that but if the reality is future of evacuations and flooding it puts damper on that romance Last summer the first in Hurricane Sandy's wake offered glimpse of what evacuations and flooding can look like for the tourism industry By the time the sea son opened many boardwalks had been rebuilt and stores were ready for business yet tourists were slow to arrive Since va typically book summer rentals in the winter it appeared that many had de cided to vacation elsewhere cool and wet spring only further dampened enthusi asm Restaurants shops and beaches were quiet particularly in June and July Of the homes damaged or destroyed in the storm 15,600 were rental properties report on the economic impact of tourism estimates that 10 percent of seasonal prop erties in Ocean Atlantic and Monmouth Counties were damaged For areas that were heavily damaged summer 2013 was bleak In Lavallette summer rentals were down 60 percent and in Ortley Beach they were down 97 percent according to Bir Realtors If you were going on vacation would you want to go to spot that had been pret ty devastated and you had to commit to rental in January said Joseph Feudi 54, who struggled last summer to rent his va cation home in Loveladies on Long Beach Island But by August day-trippers and last minute vacationers returned to the Shore making up for much of the lost revenue Both Cape May County and Monmouth County came out ahead And in Ocean County tourism sales ultimately dropped by only 2.3 percent according to report by Tourism Economics Already summer 2014 is looking bright er as vacationers plan beach getaways af ter particularly harsh winter On the website HomcAway com inquiries for North Jersey Shore summer rentals are up 66 percent from the same time last year according to the company What I'm hearing from everybody is the tourists are coming and we better be ready for them said Robert Hilton the ex ecutive director of the Jersey Shore Con vention and Visitors Bureau To some extent Hurricane Sandy creat ed barometer of risk town or property that survived the storm sets wary buyers at ease Less than year after the storm Pier Village beachfront community in Long Branch where little damage oc curred began selling condominiums near the water Now 70 percent of the 44 units have sold with prices for remaining units ranging from 439 000 for two-bedroom to 698 000 for three-bedroom with den The condo is short walk from shops and restaurants as well as the beach Almost everyone asks about the storm said Dawn Nassaney the sales manager for 55 Melrose Terrace at Pier Village If we came through Sandy un scathed that s huge selling point And on Long Beach Island Ellen and Bob Farrell spent years searching but had not been able to find turnkey property for less than million It wasn't until after the storm that they finally found one 2,600- square-foot clapboard house with wood floors throughout an open floor plan and an updated kitchen just block from the beach in Surf City The Farrells bought it on Halloween for 723 000 With all the devastation that went on there is no time like the present Ms Far rell 50, said Sandy was reality check for lot of people especially for us We felt like we really need to step back and enjoy our lives   Who has to elevate Any home in flood zone that was declared substantially damaged meaning it would cost 50 percent or more of the home s pre-dam- age market value to restore must be rebuilt to current standards which may re quire elevating the property New construction in flood zone may also have to be ele vated How high must build In New Jersey the first floor of new homes built in flood zone must be elevated at least one foot above the flood line although local communi ties may have stricter rules Homes that are at risk of three-foot breaking waves must be built on pilings or columns Rood insurance Required for anyone with federally backed mortgage in flood zone This can be cost ly for homes that aren't ele vated For example the an nual premium for house built three feet below the rec ommended elevation level is 806 per year and 374 year for the same home built one foot above that level FEMA can help ers cover some costs   RONDA KAYSEN   Harvey Cedars

2239,1932856568,"Disparate Forces Align Over Affordable Rents By ELI KOSI NHl U(. The letter came in the dead of winter, dated Jan. 29. In a written ?notice of termination,” Toussaint Wortham’s landlord accused him of violating his lease by making some renovations in his kitchen, and telling him that he had two weeks to leave the rent-stabilized apartment he had lived in for more than 30 years. A few weeks later, Mr. Wortham Wortham said, his rent check was returned; returned; his landlord had refused to accept it. Then, he said, the building?s manager offered to bu?- him out of the unit if he agreed to vacate for good. After he refused, he was served with court papers. Mr. Wortham, 39, contends that the new set of cabinets he installed installed more than five years earlier earlier was not the impetus for his landlord?s action. The real problem problem was his rent; at $859 a month, it is far less than what the three-bedroom apartment would command at market rate in his increasingly popular Brooklyn neighborhood. Rather than call a lawyer, Mr. Wortham turned to a group called the Crown Heights Tenant Union. Founded by a handful of young Occupy Wall Street veterans last summer, the Crown Heights Tenant Tenant Union is one of the most effective effective groups at dealing with issues issues raised by the rapid gentrification gentrification of the neighborhood, just east of Prospect Park. It has organized organized tenants in some 20 buildings, buildings, to combat what the group says are patterns of abuse directed directed at residents like Mr. Wortham, Wortham, who live in the area’s many rent-regulated apartments. Struggles between tenants and landlords arc nothing new, but this one has a twist: Fueled by the influx of a new generation of socially conscious recent college graduates, most of whom, unlike Mr. Wortham, have only lived in the neighborhood for a couple of years, the group is challenging the stereotypes that pit long-term residents against newer ones, which are often drawn along racial racial and class lines, in the struggle struggle over gentrification. “It’s pretty unique,” said Kerri White, an organizer with the Urban Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, which, along with the Pratt Area Community Council, is one of the seasoned advocacy L a i • aqniseer loqnge ONE-WAY FARES FROM NEW YORK CITY TO: CHICAGO JACKSONVILLE CHARLESTON SAVANNAH NEW ORLEANS MIAMI Making 500 destinations a far better ride. s 101 s 131 *120 *124 *150 *141 AMTRAK Enjoy the journey.

Crown Heights, the group’s organizers organizers say, is a perfect storm of housing issues, where regulated apartments can rent for as little as half of w hat they could garner at market rates. According to advocates, advocates, the area has also been disproportionately affected by the return of what they call “predatory equity,” where pri vale equity firms acquire buildings buildings with a high percentage of rent-regulated units and a business business plan to convert those units to market rate rentals. The Tenant Union hopes that by organizing tenants, educating them about (heir rights and streamlining information about the city’s arcane housing laws, it will be able to help fend off landlords landlords who aggressively, and at times, the group says, illegally, try to clear rent-stabilized units of their long-term residents. The group’s position is (hat the harassment used to clear longstanding longstanding tenants from apartments apartments to make way for more affluent affluent young adults like themselves, themselves, who are often willing to pay much more for apartments, is a cycle of exploitation. Older residents gel displaced from rent-stabilized apartments by landlords who harass them into buyouts, neglect to make repairs repairs or stop accepting their rent checks, the group says. Landlords Landlords then might overcharge subsequent subsequent tenants by illegally inflating inflating rent on what is still, in many cases, a rent-stabilized unit. According to the group’s logic, breaking this cycle would make life easier for the area’s longtime residents, while keeping keeping rents lower for newcomers like themselves, many of whom arc earning entry-level professional professional wages. Some landlords in the area dispute dispute the accounts of tenants in the union. A man who identified himself as Kenneth Rosenblum, one of the owners of Mr. Wortham’s Wortham’s building, acknowledged that he w-as currently in court with Mr. Wortham amid eviction proceedings. ?He did something which was w rong. He has to take responsibility for his conduct,? Sterling Place in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The neighborhood, which is east of Prospect Park, has become increasingly popular. Nicole Carty is one of the organizers of the Crown I leights Tenant Tenant Union and a veteran of the Occupy Wall Street movement. said Mr. Rosenblum. ?The court will be the one that makes that decision.? Mr. Rosenblum rejected the notion notion that he would try to push out a rent-stabilized tenant. “We have these existing tenants who have asked us and we have put in new kitchens, new baths, whatever whatever anyone wants,” he said. “We arc there to be of service.? Other groups have tried to organize organize in Crown Heights but have been less effective. The Crown Heights Assembly, for example, gained attention in 2013 for sticker-bombing sticker-bombing buildings and loudly protesting against a local brokerage’s brokerage’s procedures. The brokerage responded by filing a $31 million lawsuit against the assembly. Organizers say the Crown Heights Tenant Union has found success where the Crowm Heights Assembly and Occupy Wall Street did not by focusing more on inclusion. “For whatever reason, this is really working,? said Nicole Carty, 25, a recent graduate of Brown University and a former facilitator with the Occupy movement, who helped found the group last summer. The union has delivered a list of demands to various landlords in the area. Modeled on collective bargaining agreements, the list calls for, among other things, a five-year rent freeze, a right to timely repairs and an ?an end to the cycle of displacement.” They say their message is taking root with some in their intended audience: audience: the landlords of a building on Union Street where they held a small protest have started making making more repairs to currently occupied occupied apartments and stopped renovating vacant ones, according according to organizers. The rally on Union Street drew more than 50 neighborhood residents. residents. Letitia James, the city’s public advocate, recently sent a staff member to meet with the group. They arc also working closely with South Brooklyn Legal Legal Services to help connect tenants tenants to attorneys. The group’s organizers organizers say they are reaching around 500 tenants, and that about 80 arc regularly involved. One of these is Heather 1 fill, 62, who says her landlord won’t make timely repairs to the rentstabilized rentstabilized one-bedroom she rents for about $800 a month. She claims it took more than two months for her bathroom ceiling to be fixed after a part of it collapsed collapsed last summer. Ms. Ifill, who learned of the group from a flyer posted in her St. Marks Avenue building, says she doesn’t think there’s anything hypocritical about the area’s new residents trying to help out its older ones. “I’m glad that somebody is coming forward and trying to help the people in the area get through all of this,? she said. She says she feels sympathy for some of them. ?If you come out here just starting out working, how can you pay the amount of money that they’re asking for?? she said. “Everybody deserves to live someplace. Everybody deserves to have a nice apartment.?",4/29/2014,"('the', 'rapid', 'gentrification')","('the', 'neighborhood', 'just')","[' Founded by a handful of young Occupy Wall Street veterans last summer, the Crown Heights Tenant Tenant Union is one of the most effective effective groups at dealing with issues issues raised by the rapid gentrification gentrification of the neighborhood, just east of Prospect Park.']", Founded by a handful of young Occupy Wall Street veterans last summer the Crown Heights Tenant Tenant Union is one of the most effective effective groups at dealing with issues issues raised by the rapid gentrification gentrification of the neighborhood just east of Prospect Park,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The city’s green spaces become essential essential rest stops, known as migrant migrant traps, amid a landscape of concrete and asphalt. “If they don’t get a chance to feed and bulk up, they may not make it to their breeding ground,?

His club has been lobbying the city?s parks department and the Prospect Park Alliance, the nonprofit nonprofit conservancy that maintains maintains the grounds with the city, for more enforcement and for signs to mark where dogs can wander off-leash.

F. M and R - affected by a derailment on Friday, officials officials announced on Sunday night. A spokesman for the agency, Adam Lisberg, said investigators had found a fracture in a portion of the express track near the 65th Street station in Wood side, Queens, where an F train derailed. derailed. “It was severed in a pretty obvious obvious way,” he said. But Mr. Lisberg Lisberg said that the exact cause of the derailment, the worst in more than two decades for the New York City subway system, remained remained unclear. The accident occurred around 10:30 a.m. on Friday as a Manhattan-bound Manhattan-bound train passed through the station. The tracks slope seemed to be posing for a photographer photographer and two bird-watchers. Its statuesque silhouette was shimmering shimmering in the surface of the Lull water when its neck shot up. Above, a spray of robins, mourning mourning doves, cardinals and a blue jay darted out of the trees, and a cluster of warblers that had been chirping went quiet. On the muddy pathway below, just beyond the sanctioned offleash offleash area, was a black-and-w hite Siberian husky sniffing its way along the water’s edge. The egret looked around before opening its white w ings to propel itself to the other side. A gray-haired man in an Audubon-branded Audubon-branded windbreaker shot the dog a stony stare as it trotted blithely out of sight. Its owner trailed several paces behind, leash in hand. Mr. Welz, who is a journalist trained in ornithology, was also taken out of the moment. “Dog owners have been generously generously accommodated,? he said, ?and they just abuse that. They disregard everybody else who uses the park. The arrogance is astonishing.? Michelle Boyd, 31, who was recently recently in the peninsula meadow with her beagle-terrier mix, Chloc, said the birders she encountered encountered can be “kind of mean.? “If I see a bird-watcher out and there’s a fork in the road,” she said, “I try to avoid them in an effort effort to avoid confrontation, but also to respect their space.?

Well. U.P.S. in the United Kingdom tells us that Buckingham Palace has rejected the package. So your choices arc to pay $90.40 to have the package returned here, or to have it destroyed.’’ Long pause, as the manager listened. “Yes,sir. I understand that. I’m sure it was a very nice gift. But the package was rejected, so you need to come in here by this time tomorrow to pay the $90.40 and have it returned, or the package will be destroyed.?

Of the tram’s eight cars, the middle six derailed, raising raising the possibility that the track fractured as the train was passing passing over it. The damaged track was being sent for metallurgical testing, the authority said over the weekend. That testing could determine whether the metal was flawed or could lead investigators to focus on other potential issues, such as the installation of the track. Mr. Lisberg said the age of the steel rail did not appear to be a factor in the derailment, because it was manufactured in November November 2013 and installed in March. “I saw the rail with my own eyes,? he said. “It was stamped U.S.A., 2013.? Mr. Lisberg said there was “no indication that the operator or crew did anything wrong whatsoever? whatsoever? that might have been a factor factor in the derailment.

2474,1932889380,"RETAILING As Dealers Settle In, Residential Developers Come Knocking By KEN BELSON The history of real estate in Manhattan is one of ebbs and flows. The diamond district district moved from Canal Street to Midtown, the city’s hanks have gravitated from Wall Street to Park Avenue, and the theater district district shifted north to Times Square. Automobile Row is no different. Many dealerships that were once clustered along Broadway in the West 50s, or on Park Avenue, Avenue, now have their showrooms on I It h Avenue from 47th to 57th Streets. In the last few years, more than $1 billion billion has been spent in the area on new or expanded showrooms and service centers for BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Audi, and Chrysler and Fiat, among others. (One of the first in the wave of up grades was Ford, which in 200*1 moved all of its brands into a renovated building that was built for Packard.) The merry-go-round continues to spin. Next year, Manhattan Motorcars will move its Porsche store about a mile north to a sales and service center that Chrysler used before moving to 12th Avenue. Part of the appeal of llth Avenue is the availability of large commercial buildings near the West Side Highway and Lincoln Tunnel, providing easy access for consumers consumers who want the convenience of shopping for different brands of cars in one locale. But unlike the typical suburban strip of dealerships, the dozen or so dealers on llth Avenue have tried to make a statement by creating showcases for new models and offering offering high-end amenities like coffee bars and Wi-Fi. The dealerships are designed not just to appeal to consumers, but also to the business community. “New York is so important to the auto industry, industry, not just with the number of cars they sell, but in talking to Wall Street and Madison Avenue,? said Mark Schienberg, the president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. “It’s like why companies advertise during the Super Bowl. It positions them to be talked about in a way they can’t in other ways.” Porsche is the latest company to join the party. For about 20 years, Manhattan Motorcars Motorcars has sold Porsches in a building at llth Avenue and 28th Street that is now too small, said Glenn Garde, the director of dealer network development for Porsche Cars North America. In the new location on llth Avenue, which will have 125,000 square feet and the rights to build on another another 60,000 square feet, Porsche will be able to take advantage of increased foot traffic. Currently, “we’re in a situation where we arc separated from the automotive business in Manhattan,” Mr. Garde said, adding that the Porsche franchise would Dealer Directory NYTIMES.COM/AUTOS SAAB M SAAB VE aFFaIr CONTINUES AT cSSs?iSSSi TIhe Metro Area?s Most LoviNq SAAb DeaIer 20/ W CimraI Avinui MavwoocI, Nl 888 - 815-1630 SaIes • StRvicE • Parts PAR kAvESAAb.COM Park, Ave P«iw»tt c ft Imported AUTOMOBILE EXCHANGE CommH Hwm columns every day |212) 354 3*00 to place your ad Antique ?

Porsche plans a two-story atrium and cafe. Customers will able to drop their cars inside to avoid the weather and to watch repairs through internal windows. As Automobile Row has grown, so has residential development in the area. Pressed by developers seeking relatively inexpensive land and views of the Hudson River, the city rezoned sections of the Far West Side, including parts of llth Avenue. In June 2011, the City Planning Department Department and Community Board 4 approved residential development on the cast side of the avenue that includes Automobile Row. The gentrification of what had been a gritty neighborhood has come at a cost. An independently owned Nissan-lnfiniti dealership, dealership, just two years old, lost its lease and shut its doors on Thursday to make way for apartments. Travis Par man, a spokesman spokesman for Nissan Americas, said the company company was “exploring other opportunities.” There are still 34 dealers within a 25-mile radius of Manhattan, he said. “It’s really about real estate values on the rise in Manhattan, and that is especially especially true when they rezone commercial for residential property,” Mr. Parman said. The influx of new dealerships and residents residents has led to mixed-use projects. The 330,000-squarc-foot Mercedes-Benz dealership dealership on llth Avenue that opened in 2012 is part of a 29-story residential development development called Mercedes House. “We believe this is the profile of things to come, as valuable vertical space and air rights will be optimized,” said David McArdle, McArdle, a managing director for Cushman ? Wakefield in New York. The co-mingling has not led to much friction, friction, according to Robert Bcnfatto Jr. of Community Board 4. He has received a few complaints about night deliveries, noisy rooftop air-conditioners and cars parked on sidewalks, but the problems were resolved resolved with a phone call or two. “The problems problems are all fixable,” he said, adding that new condominiums tend to have thicker windows, damping the noise. Voice Recognition Still a Top Complaint, Study Says By JOHN R. QUA IN The technology in new cars that bedevils bedevils drivers more than any other is voice recognition. In a presentation on Wednesday at the annual Management Briefing Seminars of the Center for Automotive Automotive Research, held in Traverse City, Mich., Kristin Kolodge of J. D. Power said that 32 percent of all infotainment-related infotainment-related complaints were a result of voice-recognition errors, according to the company’s quality studies. “People think it’s their fault,” Ms. Kolodge, lower’s executive director AUTOBAHN AVENUE Top, the Nissan-lnfiniti dealership on llth Avenue at 47th Street closed to make way for apartments. apartments.

For instance, some vehicles can understand only a handful of commands and work only if the driver is on the corresponding screen; speaking an address won’t work when the system is looking for radio stations. Such systems arc handicapped by limited memory and processing pow er, said Mike Thompson, an executive While Automobile Row is a magnet for high-end dealerships, some automakers have showrooms elsewhere in the borough to reach different audiences. Tesla, for instance, instance, has a store on West 25th Street in Chelsea, near many art galleries. The store is “surrounded by some of New York City’s most creative outlets and draws in visitors who are exploring the neighborhood,” said Alexis Gcorgeson, a spokeswoman for the company. The location location is near the West Side Highway so customers customers can test-drive new Teslas. She said Tesla would open a kiosk on the ground floor of the busy l ime Warner Center Center in mid-September. In search of younger customers, Lexus plans a store in the meatpacking district. A Lexus spokeswoman told the Villager news site that the store would include a gallery, lounge and boutique. Moe Durand, a spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales, would not confirm those details, details, but said, “We’re trying to expand our reach into more youthful markets, and there’s a certain energy in that area that operates well with our brand.” BMW of Manhattan has a showroom on Wall Street in proximity to bankers who receive large annual bonuses. Commercial space is at such a premium on llth Avenue that some companies have moved to 12th Avenue. Last year, the Chrysler and Fiat operations were combined combined in an 110,000-square-foot building that was previously an Audi dealership. Now Fiat can advertise to drivers streaming streaming onto the West Side Highway. “We took advantage of the exposure, but you lose a little bit of the foot traffic,? said Cheryl Ansel, who works for the Chrysler Group Realty Company.

Advances will come with next-level systems that understand more syn onyms and let drivers speak naturally. Further improvements will depend on more vehicles’ connecting to the Internet Internet to take advantage of the processing processing power and storage available online, Mr. Thompson said.

But the past was totally eclipsed in Janu ary 2012, when Mr. Sachs, now 18, married the artist Boris Torres, 38, and one week later they became parents with Kirsten Johnson, w?ho gave birth to twins a boy named Felix and a girl named Viva. “I went from living alone to living w?ith my husband, our kids, their mom and occasional occasional visiting family members,” Mr. Sachs said. “The house blossomed at that point. It went from dark times to something that has been very beautiful but a little messier than it used to be.? Mr. Sachs has always loved filling his home with people. “One of the best things about this apartment,? he said, ?is that it’s centrally located, which has made it a gathering place.?

Felix and Viva spend Monday, Wednesday and Friday Friday nights with their mother, and Tuesdays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays with their fathers. “We alternate Sundays,” Mr. Sachs said. ?That is when we have parents’ meetings after the kids have gone to bed.” Mr. Sachs doesn’t consider his family unconventional. “People say, *Wow, it’s unique how you are raising kids,’ but I have to say that nothing about it feels particularly particularly original to me because it feels or ganic,? he said. “I was also raised by two parents in two homes. The consistency of love seems most important, and my kids have that.? Collective living and the vicissitudes of New York real estate are themes that Mr. Sachs explores in his new movie, “Love Is Strange,” which he directed and co-wrote. It stars John Lithgow as Ben, a retired painter, and Alfred Molina as George, a music teacher, who get married after being together for 39 years, which leads to George being fired from his job at a Catholic Catholic school. Forced to sell the co-op that they can no longer afford, they are temporarily homeless and must stay with friends and relatives. “‘Love Is Strange’ is about the lack of distinction between biological and communal communal families,” Mr. Sachs said. That art imitates life for Mr. Sachs is evident evident from the two life-study drawings that hang over Ben and George’s bed in the opening scene of ?Love Is Strange.? In real life, they hang next to Mr. Sachs’s bed. “They are very important to me,” he said. “They were done by a sculptor named Ted Rust, who was the partner of my greatuncle greatuncle Ben Goodman for 45 years. The drawings are from Ted’s sketchbook when he got his M.F.A. at Yale in the 1930s.” Another one of Mr. Sachs’s favorite artworks artworks is a framed piece of graffiti on wood by Keith Haring that hangs over the dining table. Mr. Torres, who teaches at Humanities Humanities Preparatory Academy in Chelsea, brought it with him w-hen he moved into the apartment. “This is possibly the first Barking Dog,? said Mr. Sachs, referring to one of Mr. Haring’s Haring’s signature figures. “Boris was very The filmmaker Ira Sachs, foreground, lives with his husband, the artist Boris Torres; their tw ins, Viva, left, and Felix, split their time between their home and that of the children’s mother, Kirsten Johnson, a cinematographer, who lives next door. close to a man named Michael Zimmer, who inspired the character of Ben. He lived in the West Village in a house with two gay cops upstairs, and Boris and I spent a lot of time there, and we were a hodgepodge family. The barking dog was painted on a bodega that was a construction construction site, and Michael bought it from the owner and he left it to Boris when he died.? A ceiling sculpture made by Mr. Zimmer hangs by the window in the twins’ bedroom bedroom instead of a more traditional mobile. “It’s made from hundreds of laundry tags, and the kids like to blow on them,? said Mr. Sachs, who also loves the sculpture by his friend Ward Yoshimolo that hangs over the changing table, spelling out the twins’ names in fanciful lettering with hovering porcelain birds. There are also family heirlooms from his childhood home: a painting of his mother at age 1 that now hangs over Felix’s bed; a child’s rocker in the living room with the insignia of Wellesley College, his mother’s alma mater, that she was given when she had her first child. ?It’s been in my sisters’ homes when their children were young and now it’s in mine,? Mr. Sachs said. One of his favorite spots in the bright corner apartment is the living room’s window window scat with a view up Fifth Avenue. “Many a Gay Pride Parade has been watched from here,? said Mr. Sachs, who appreciates the gentrification of nearby Eighth Street. ?It used to be the shoe street, but now it’s Stumptown and the Marlton Hotel, where I have tea or lunch many times a week,” he said. “And my kids love the party store that has everything they could ever want, and they beg to go there on a daily basis.” The twins have opened his eyes to one of his neighborhood’s greatest assets. “The thing I have discovered — which is hard to believe when you have lived somewhere for 15 years — is Washington Square Park, which was refurbished just when we had kids,? said Mr. Sachs, who marvels that there are separate playgrounds for toddlers toddlers and older children. He is glad he resisted the urge to move. ?It’s interesting to be in one place for so many chapters of one’s life,? he said.",9/7/2014,"('who', 'appreciates', 'the')","('nearby', 'eighth', 'street')","[' Sachs, who appreciates the gentrification of nearby Eighth Street.']", Sachs who appreciates the gentrification of nearby Eighth Street,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest latest addition is “The Algonquin Round Table New York: A Historical Historical Guide” (Globe Pequot Press), by Kevin C. Fitzpatrick, president of the Dorothy Parker Society. “Nothing is more responsible for the good old days than a bad memory,” the columnist Franklin P. Adams once wrote, and Mr. Fitzpatrick deftly mines a cornucopia cornucopia of recollections to recreate the self-styled Vicious Circle that began one day as a press agent’s practical joke played on The New York Times drama critic Alexander Alexander Woollcott. This delightful illustrated reminiscence reminiscence profiles the full cast of wits who defined cosmopolitan culture through the 1920s and leads readers on a revealing tour of their haunts. THE NEW YORK WORLD Of WecgCC — the pseudonym of Usher Fcllig, Fcllig, “the doci?mcntarian of urban calamity” — was a far cry from the gentility of the Algonquin or the future gentrification of the photographer’s stamping ground. Drawing largely on the International Center of Photography’s Photography’s collection, Philomcna Mariani Mariani and Christopher George have compiled “The Weegee Guide to New York” (DelMonico Books), a gritty reminder of street life in the ’30s and ’40s. They write that Weegee captured captured the city’s ?inhabitants navigating navigating through street chaos without without the protective shield of mobile mobile devices and earphones.” A Political Animal Speaks CONTINUED FROM PAUL I paign, Mr. de Blasio benefited greatly from the efforts made by animal-rights supporters supporters under the umbrella of a group called NYCIass to defeat Christine Quinn, whose views on the horse-carriage trade the group’s members fiercely opposed. When Mr. de Blasio took office, NYCIass, along with the American Society for the Prevention Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals, delivered a paper to City I lull called “New York City Animal Welfare Priorities 2014.” The first item on the agenda was the establishment of an office to oversee policy related to the care of domestic and wild animals. Actually, when you think about it, you’re willing to put the politics aside. All along you have been saying, ?A talc of two cities? Tell me about it. It’s a tale of two kennels.” Just the other day you encountered a West Highland terrier in Brooklyn Heights who was getting through the winter with a hunter green and pink tartan jacket his owner’s mother had purchased on a recent trip to Scotland. Please, you know mixedbreeds mixedbreeds who would be thrilled with acrylic from Rockaway Boulevard. About 30,000 animals arc turned over to the city’s animal care and control unit every every year. Some are given up because owners owners become too old or too poor to take care of them. “I’ve worked in the city’s shelters and they arc third world,” the fashion designer designer and animal-rights advocate John Bartlett said in an interview. “People who arc evicted dump their animals there. There arc a lot of strays that get picked up on the street. There arc a lot who end up there because people arc arrested.?

Obviously, your canine Marxist is awakened. But things arc looking up — even you, with your permanent grumpy face, arc willing to acknowledge that. The city is dedicating $8 million to improving two major major shelters and acquiring mobile adoption units for the Bronx and Queens. Mr. Dupec comes from a respected organization, organization, the Farm Sanctuary, which works to protect farm animals from abuse. ?I view my role in a lot of ways,” the mayor’s mayor’s pets czar said. “I want to be the eyes and ears on the street for these issues.? Among the issues he will deal with: geese. There has been an attempt to remove remove them from around La Guardia Airport Airport so they do not endanger air safety, and the feeling among animals’ advocates is that they need to be removed compassionately. compassionately. The population of feral cats in the city has escalated and needs to be controlled controlled humanely with neutering. There is a constituency that would like to sec ferrets ferrets sanctioned as house pets. “No one has come forward about coyotes,” coyotes,” Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, the deputy mayor of health and human services, who will indirectly oversee Mr. Dupec, said in an interview. “But there was a coyote in Stuyvcsant Town and another in Riverside Park, so clearly they are migrating this way.” Humans have encroached on their habitat, she said. Wild turkeys arc running amok on Staten Staten Island. Two years ago the federal Agriculture Agriculture Department rounded some up in a “capture and removal” operation for slaughter. The city would like to sec this population controlled humanely as well. In December the city banned the sale of rabbits in pet shops. Rabbits arc often given given as gifts to children who quickly grow bored by them, Mr. Dupec said, meaning that many end up in the shelter system. Between January and October of last year, more than 375 rabbits were given over to the city’s animal care and control division. And we know not even to get you started on the dogs coming through puppy mills. But now? you feel heard, don’t you? Come the next election, you may even try one of those human disguises and vote.

Neighborhoods farther west are primarily automobile territory. Some developments have been years in the making and unable to stay on schedule, which developers and brokers say has in turn delayed the gentrification of surrounding surrounding blocks. But if the pace of progress has been halting, this year could mark a turning point, with major projects starting construction, hundreds of new apartments coming to market, and online searches for Staten Island homes jumping off the charts — a strong indicator of future future sales. Last week, groundbreaking ceremonies took place for a $350 million project in St. George: F?mpire Outlets, a mall and entertainment entertainment complex. The New York Wheel, a 630-fool-tall Ferris wheel that has been compared with the London Eye, also was to break ground in St. George last week, but at the last minute announced a delay. Richard A. Marin, the president of the company formed to develop the $500 million project, said he had about $200 million million in loans and equity in place, but hundreds hundreds of millions in other loans still have to be finalized. “I will get my moment in the sun in a few weeks,” he said. The outlets, the first of their kind in the city, are taking aim at the hordes of foreign tourists who ride the ferries for views of the Statue of Liberty. The project has already already been marketed in Germany, Italy and France, with a similar push planned for more than a dozen other countries, according according to project officials.

Capoccia, BFC’s managing principal. principal. (Mr. Capoccia promises to replace all those parking spaces and then some.) About 30 percent of the 3-10,000 square feet of retail space at the outlets is now leased to stores, including Nordstrom Rack, II ?

Mr. Capoccia points out that he did not just step off a ferry yesterday; his Staten Island developments include affordable housing in Stapleton. He owns a large plot there, near the waterfront, where he hopes to put up apartments after the city acts on its promise to rezonc a 14-block stretch to allow for taller buildings. “What’s happening here is not developer-driven,” developer-driven,” said Mr. Capoccia, who started his career in the East Village in the 1980s and later planted his flag in other neighborhoods neighborhoods before they became gentrified, including Downtown Brooklyn. “The developers developers are following people here, there’s no question about that.” Of course, before people can toss a Frisbee Frisbee on any lawns, they need places to live, and while new housing has been slow to roll out in St. George, a dazzling option will soon be unveiled in Stapleton. Rising on a desolate stretch of waterfront waterfront is URL Staten Island, short for “Urban “Urban Ready Life,” a $250 million mixed-use project with about 900 rental apartments in a series of buildings resembling factories, factories, with bands of windows and flat roofs, the better to house bee hives.

Interiors will feature stone counters counters and bamboo floors, plus stacked washers washers and dryers. Studios will likely start around $1,600 a month, and two-bedrooms at $2,800, said David Barry, the president of Ironstate Development, the developer. The site will contain 35,000 square feet of retail space, more than half of which is now leased. Among the future tenants are a pizzeria, pizzeria, a store dedicated to specialty olive oils and Lola Star, a Coney Island clothing shop that is soon to open a branch in that other rising outpost, the Rockaways. Coffeed, Coffeed, a chain that brewed its first cup in Long Island City, Queens, will also be there. National chain stores, such as those that dot Staten Island’s strip malls, are not welcome welcome at URL. “This place has its own special special character,” Mr. Barry said. “The stores should reflect that.” URL will also have a 5,000-square-foot plot planted with vegetables that can be purchased from an on-site farm stand. Or, for a fee, residents will be able to request that its kale, spinach, rainbow chard and mizuna be prepared by a chef who will do double duty as the head farmer, said Mr. Barry, who was sifting through resumes for the post as he spoke. Simultaneously, the city is spending $32 million to improve the look of Stapleton streets as well as create a leafy three-anda-half three-anda-half acre esplanade that will rim the harbor’s harbor’s edge, like that of Battery Park City in Manhattan. On the site of the llomeport naval base, URL Staten Island represents the culmination culmination of years of effort to reinvent a roughand-tumble roughand-tumble industrial area. At the moment, barbed wire lops fences under elevated train tracks; a purple octopus octopus by a graffiti artist bares its fangs at passers-by. Shuttered storefronts are common common on commercial strips along Bay Street and around Stapleton Park. Whether URL can provide a spark for the larger neighborhood remains to be seen. But change seems to be arriving incrementally incrementally in the meantime. New restaurants, for instance, are staking staking out claims. The River Dock Cafe joined a Dairy Queen at the St. George ferry terminal terminal this winter, and is serving lobster in a sleek, spacious dining room with bay views. At around the same time, a branch of Defonte’s, a sandwich shop that has been a mainstay of Red Hook, Brooklyn, for decades, opened across from Tappen Park in Stapleton, making supersize heroes heroes like the “Italian Stallion,” with prosciutto, prosciutto, mozzarella and fried eggplant. In Mr. Barry’s eyes, the table has been set. “I think it is just a matter of creating a little street life, to get some more bodies on the street,” he said. “This place has great assets.” Less far along than URL, but similarly ambitious, is Lighthouse I*nint, a mixeduse mixeduse complex planned for St. George that will tuck retail and apartment buildings into the brick campus of the United States Lighthouse Service Depot, where Fresnel lenses were housed.

Going up, URL Staten Island, a mixed-use rental complex. A lot in Stapleton awaits new life. A rendering of Lighthouse Point, to incorporate old and new buildings. A rendering of Empire Outlets to feature retail, a 199-unit hotel, restaurants and parking. Originally scheduled to break ground this spring, and now delayed until late summer, the complex will initially include a 12-story, 116-unit apartment tower with stores, offices and restaurants at its base. Other buildings in the $200 million project will come later, including a hotel whose lobby will incorporate one of the lighthouse buildings, Ms. Goldman said. The project will wrap up by 2018, she said. Yes, Staten Island has a bit of a public relations relations problem, Ms. Goldman said, adding, adding, “until you get someone on the ferry. Then you pull up to this beautiful place, with this beautiful architecture, and you say to yourself, ‘How could I possibly be in New York?’” Though it can take some time, projects here do eventually seem to coalesce. The Bay Street Landing complex in St. George, a former warehouse-lined shipping shipping area for cocoa beans, for instance, began began to reinvent itself as a gated community community in the 1980s and is just finishing up now, with the 100-unit Accolade, a conversion of a warehouse. But interest from prospective buyers is more intense this time around than with the other phases, brokers say. Of the 75 or so units that have sold at the Accolade since winter 2014, more than 20 were to buyers from Brooklyn and Manhattan, Manhattan, according to a spokesman for the project, with 42 from Staten Island, and the rest from outside New York, perhaps drawn by the pet spa, the golf simulator and the lawn with Adirondack chairs and barbecue grills. In mid-April, studios started started at $325,000; one-bed rooms started at $410,000. By contrast, in the first quarter of this year in Manhattan, studios in new buildings buildings sold for an average of $787,000, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm. At the same time, newly constructed one-bedrooms there went for an average of $1.15 million. Of course, the island still has an off-themap off-themap image and can be proud of it. The Flagship Brewing Company, whose motto is “unforgettable beer brewed in the forgotten forgotten borough,” opened last year in Tompkinsvillc. And Erich von Hasscln, 25, an art student, is among those who aren’t eager for their haven to be discovered any time soon. “You always have to look where everybody everybody else is not. It’s a survival mechanism if you’re an artist,” said Mr. von Hasscln of his move to Staten Island in 2014 from Ridgewood, Queens, after a stint in Bushwick, Bushwick, Brooklyn. Cost was a major force for that move, said Mr. von Hasseln, who is studying printmaking in Manhattan. Next month, he will move to an apartment apartment in a wood-frame house with a gambrel gambrel roof in Stapleton; he and a roommate will divide the rent of $1,400 a month. Mr. von Hasscln has also found low-cost studio space on the island but refused to say where, lest the area be overrun with fellow artists. His commuting costs are low. He rides his bike to and from the ferry in every season season except winter. As of May 1, those ferries ferries will run more frequently during the wee hours. More routes may be coming. Earlier this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed ferry service directly to Stapleton as part of an expansion of service citywide, though Stapleton-bound Stapleton-bound boats will sail only on paper until 2019 at the earliest. For Mr. von Hasseln, who grew up in rural upstate New York, Staten Island has one other thing going for it — a lack of obsession obsession with of-the-moment night life: “I got tired of living somewhere that was really hip,” he said. It’s not just artists who are concerned with the bottom line. Mr. Bird, the Stapleton Stapleton buyer, had his heart set on Ditmas Park in Brooklyn, known for its grand Victorian Victorian houses. But they were listed for as much as $4 million, he said. With around $600,000 to spend, he and his fiancee, Maria Elena Rubino, 23, an analyst analyst at Goldman Sachs, also looked in Brooklyn Heights. But that kind of money bought only a one-bedroom there, Mr. Bird said. But on St. Paul’s Avenue in Stapleton, a historic district, the couple found a shingle and clapboard 1880s house with numerous porches and six bedrooms, for $620,000. “My friends in Manhattan all live over banks and pharmacies, and you don’t see that here,” he said. In 2014, 31 one- and two-family homes sold in Stapleton, at an average price of $245,000, according to data from the Staten Island Board of Realtors prepared by Richard Richard Mohr, its controller. That was up from the 27 that sold in 2013, at an average of $221,000, he said. Similarly, in Tompkinsville, six houses sold in 2014 at an average of $319,000, versus versus three in 2013 at an average of $222,000, according to the data. In Clifton, meanwhile, meanwhile, 29 houses sold in 2014 at an average of $227,000, the data show, versus 24 in 2013 at $225,000. This year, interest from prospective buyers buyers and renters appears to be on the upswing, upswing, as indicated by searches and clicks on nytimes.com: From April 2014 to March 2015, searches for Staten Island homes for sale jumped 62 percent, while views of specific properties soared by 128 percent. In the same time frame, searches for rental units shot up 81 percent; clicks on specific rental properties properties increased 39 percent. From February to March, searches of all Staten Island homes for sale jumped 54 percent. Also from February to March, clicks on specific homes for sale increased more than in any other borough, going up by 102 percent, as opposed to a 6 percent increase in Br?x)klyn, according to New York Times data. Sari Kingsley, who moved from Crown Heights to Staten Island four decades ago and today owns Kingsley Real Estate, joked that it used to be “traumatic? for Brooklynites to move to the borough.

736,2074309002,"Savannah District Emerges From Decay   Part of the Starland Dairy set for development in Savannah Ga The surround ing neighborhood is attracting art studios offices galleries and cafes Page 8.   STEPHEN MORTON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES   An Arts District Is Catching On in Savannah   Modern Vibe Near The Historic District   By ALISON GREGOR   SAVANNAH Ga --The idea of vanguard arts district may seem counterintuitive in this slow-paced city of courtly manners and stately architecture but after almost two decades an emerging area called the Starland District may finally be hitting its stride   Originally envisioned in 1998 by two graduates of the Savannah College of Art and Design the Starland District is collection of art studios small offices galleries cafes and retail shops loosely assembled around Bull Street south of Savannah's historic downtown and For syth Park At its center is the former Starland Dairy two city blocks with crumbling historic buildings bought in 2000 by the district s founders John Deaderick and Greg Jacobs They created retail shops offices and residential condos on por tion of the former dairy site while the rest remained undeveloped because of lack of financing About 2005, the area s growth attract ed Jamestown Properties an acquisi tion and management company based in Atlanta which planned to invest in vacant properties and develop condo project in former ice factory on Vic tory Drive at the southern end of the Starland District The global financial crisis of 2008 in however Jamestown eventu ally turned the roughly 125,000-square- foot project into dormitory housing for about 350 students along with commer cial space for the Florence restaurant owned by the Georgia restaurateur and chef Hugh Acheson Since opening last year the dorm One West Victory and the Florence have added much-needed foot traffic and vibrancy to the area Starland busi ness owners said People have stopped thinking about Starland as place that s going to hap pen but as one that s happening as we speak said Mr Deaderick who lives in the district and owns the Starland Cafe Mr Jacobs also lives in the Starland District which he said was an eclectic neighborhood unlike anywhere else in Savannah that served as an incubator for businesses Bigger cities can sup port many emerging neighborhoods like this but in Savannah the Starland Dis trict really filled great need he said In the first half of the 20th century the area around the Starland Dairy was prime business district and the loca tion of an early supermarket but busi nesses were closed and homes aban doned starting in the 1950s in the era of white flight Mr Deaderick said Initial efforts to revive the district re volved around restoring decaying Vic torian homes while also converting ne buildings into art studio space and offices for start-up companies Coaxing businesses that need more foot traffic such as boutique shops and restaurants into the area has taken longer One early Starland business was the Back in the Day Bakery which opened in 2001 and this year gained national ac claim as James Beard Foundation semifinalist for outstanding baker The bakery which is now also destination for tourists leased the space for many years until the owners bought the build ing on the old Starland Dairy site almost three years ago said Cheryl Day co- owner with her husband Griff Day   Ms Day said that when the bakery initially opened patrons used to call from their cars to order baked goods frightened by the derelict area s rep utation for crime We have huge windows and we d say 'We see you It's safe and you can come in Ms Day said The neigh borhood was kind of rough around the edges at the time Numerous factors among them is sues of perceived gentrification of the area as well as lack of institutional fi nancing for development have slowed efforts to revitalize the district Mr Ja cobs said Businesses have come and gone but in the last year people are finally start ing to get feel for what the neigh borhood needs including new vintage shops art galleries and restaurants Ms Day said Mr Jacobs said that spaces that had been vacant for longer than he s been involved with the district now have businesses moving into them More importantly the area is devel oping its own identity which is really thrilling to see he said An art supply store Starlandia   opened in late May filling niche in the district which has two Savannah Col lege of Art and Design academic build ings and several student dorms nearby Starlandia's owner Clinton Edminster is also the founder and executive di rector of Art Rise Savannah nonprofit organization that operates an art gal lery in the old dairy and organizes the First Friday Art March monthly event that has helped increase aware ness of the district With new restaurants and bars look ing for space in the district major turning point is going to be activating the nighttime spaces Mr Edminster said And feel like the atmosphere is prime to develop Starland business al liance Ele Tran the owner of six Savannah restaurants will open new one the Vault Kitchen Market in former bank building in the Starland District this fall Ms Tran says she discovered the building two years ago because her sister lives in the district It's just beautiful area with all these up-and-coming young profession als living there and lot of students and artsy people she said   The restaurant which will serve clas sic Asian and Laotian fusion cuisine will offer lunch and dinner while mak ing use of the former bank s drive- through she said About 10,000 square feet of un- restored space in the former Starland Dairy is also being developed into market for locally sourced food similar to the East End Market in Orlando Fla and may eventually offer an urban beer garden said Nathan Fuller of Manhat tan construction manager who owns the space with his wife Maggie Consor Fuller We'd like it to be an artisanal food- focused market where you can see the products being made whether it s butcher cheesemaker ice-cream maker or brewery since my wife s back ground is in brewing science said Mr Fuller who has family ties to Savannah He said the market should open in roughly two years Savannah can be slow to change even few natives interviewed by re porter were not familiar with the Star- land District Even given the district s low profile however the central loca tion of the district makes it logical place for business expansion said Rhett Mouchet an associate commercial bro ker with Judge Realty who has worked in Savannah real estate for 40 years We still have some crime issues in that particular area occasionally and it still has some challenges to go but it has rapidly become an expansion area he said The Savannah historic district s lack of office space parking and reasonably priced retail space has begun pushing some smellier businesses to other loca tions and retail rents in Starland can be less than half the roughly 20 to 35 square foot typically sought in the his toric district which has low retail va cancy rate of 4 to 5 percent he said In commercial development you generally have an anchor and it fills in between anchor locations Mr Mou chet said With One West Victory there s lot of development headed out that way It really pushes the boundary further   One West Victory is an upscale dorm for students in the Starland District The area anchored by former dairy is attracting art studios galleries and cafes to an area of decaying Victorians and neglected buildings

Mr. Ellis said he was sickened by the shooting, and by the fact that some South Carolina whites still harbored the racist sentiments sentiments that the suspected shooter — Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man — espoused half a century after the storied gains of the civil rights movement. But still, he said, he came to work. “I’m sure a lot of the people walking around here are concerned, concerned, that they’re thinking about it,” he said as a slow-moving slow-moving river of tourists, most of them white, sauntered by in deck shoes and sandals on Saturday morning. morning. “It’s like me — I’m here, but it’s still on my mind.” Work will go on for Emanuel A.M.E., too. The church will be open for Sunday services, said Elizabeth Alston, a church member, member, even though its head pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, and two assistant pastors were among the nine church members killed. On Saturday, streams of people stopped outside the church to take pictures, to pray or to drop off mementos. Wednesday night’s massacre continues to weigh heavily on the minds and hearts of people here. Ben Mack, for one, said he had mixed feelings as he arose Saturday Saturday morning to sell jams, relishes and jellies at a stand at the weekpoisoned,” weekpoisoned,” Mrs. Clinton said. “But we can’t give up. The stakes are too high. The costs are too dear. And I am not and will not be afraid to keep fighting for common common sense reforms.” Mrs. Clinton’s strongly worded stance on the issue could help her make a contrast with Senator Bernie Sanders, who has been drawing large crowds in early voting states, where recent polls show him narrowing the gap with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders, a socialist socialist from Vermont also seeking the Democratic nomination, has a decidedly mixed record on gun control, which may pose problems problems for his campaign as it seeks to bill itself as a more liberal alternative alternative to Mrs. Clinton. Saturday was not the first time that Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic campaign, still in its infancy, had found itself having to address race and racism in the wake of violence. violence. Her first major campaign speech, at Columbia University in April, coincided with widespread unrest in Baltimore after the death of a black man, Freddie Gray, who had been injured in police police custody. Mrs. Clinton used that occasion to advocate an ly farmer’s market in Marion Square, just half a block from Emanuel. “Of course I wanted to do something good and contribute and move on with my life,” said Mr. Mack, 30, a lawyer who lives in Charleston. “At the same time, it’s concerning to think that it happened just right around the corner and that anything could happen.” Mr. Mack had a sign in front of his stand saying that he was donating donating his commission for the day to Emanuel. A stand selling roti rolls, with fillings like organic chicken, kimchi and braised pork, had written on a chalkboard beA beA city leans on a message of forgiveness from victims’ families. neath its menu that it was donating donating 10 percent of its proceeds to Emanuel. At the Andrew Pinckney Inn, a few blocks from where Mr. Ellis was selling his wares. Matt Byrd, 40, and his wife Kay, 37, had packed their bags and were preparing preparing to return to their home in New Orleans after a short vacation vacation soaking up the city’s famous architecture and partaking in its thriving and innovative restaurant restaurant scene. (The name Pinckney is not uncommon in the Lowcountry, Lowcountry, and is shared by both black and white families.

With rumors of a bomb threat circulating, they decided to take a cab back to their hotel. But other than that, they said, they were able to enjoy their vacation vacation as planned. “I don’t think we really dwelled dwelled on it,” Mr. Byrd said. “I mean, we all thought it was a bad situation.” situation.” Part of that, Ms. Byrd said, had to do with the message of forgiveness forgiveness that the members of Emanuel Emanuel A.M.E. broadcast after the massacre, and with the peaceful response of Charleston’s locals. “We heard the church members’ members’ comments talking about peace and forgiveness,” she said. “You didn’t see the anger that I’m sure people feel. I think it says something about this place that they responded like that.” Ms. Byrd said she figured that the response might not have been so peaceful if it had happened happened in another city. Nonetheless, Nonetheless, feelings of anger bubbled inside inside some city residents. On America Street on the East Side, the church killings have become part of frequent conversations about the gentrification of the historic black neighborhood, police police harassment and unemployment. unemployment. Three black men, all in their 20s, who stood on the corner of America and South Streets, said they were simply angry. One man, 22, shook his head at how relatives of the murder victims at the church said they had forgiven Mr. Roof. “Legislation ain’t getting nowhere. nowhere. You gotta fight back,” he said. In Columbia, about 1,000 protesters protesters gathered on Saturday to demand that the Confederate flag Obama, the country’s first black president. She also cited several statistics that suggest widespread widespread inequality between black and white Americans. “Our problem is not all kooks and Klansmen. It’s also the cruel joke that goes unchallenged. It’s the offhand comment about not wanting those people in the neighborhood,” Mrs. Clinton said. ?Let’s be honest, for a lot of well meaning, open-minded white be taken down from the state Capitol. In Charleston, at Mary’s Sweet Shop, its owner, Joseph Watson, who was watching the continuous continuous coverage of the shootings on a television that sat atop a refrigerator, refrigerator, said he was neither angry nor bitter. He said he hoped that the killings might provide more motivation to make improvements improvements for the black community, which he said had suffered from a lack of funding for education and after-school programs and from racism that has always enveloped enveloped Charleston. “You raise your children right, here on this street,” said Mr. Watson, Watson, 65. “Put them through college. college. They get graduate degrees. They come back. They can’t get jobs.” He paused. And then he spoke of a different “they” — white people. people. “They are not going to put us over them,” he said of some of Charleston’s white residents. “They are not going to let us teach their kids. We’re not going to be the boss over that white person.” The shootings also were on the minds of the all-white clientele Saturday at Gene’s Haufbrau, a beloved 63-year-old bar in West Ashley, a neighborhood west of the Ashley River and a few miles from downtown. The atmosphere in Gene’s, though, was decidedly low-key, with its ancient wooden booths covered in carved graffiti, burgers and corn dogs on the menu, and Led Zeppelin and Creedence Clearwater Revival on the sound system. The response here was nuanced. nuanced. A man who had worked on Wall Street said the episode reminded reminded him of the horrors of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He then invited invited a reporter to his Baptist church on Sunday. Calling for a ‘common sense’ approach to gun laws. people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear.” Mrs. Clinton, who attended a fund-raiser Wednesday in Charleston just blocks from where the shooting took place later later that night, also called Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina Carolina on Saturday to offer her support support to him and his constituents, Mr. Graham said. Race and gun violence quickly reasserted Mike Conlin, 50, who moved to Charleston from New Jersey four years ago, was sitting in a booth having a burger and a Bud Light. He said he had begun carrying a firearm since the Wednesday night killings, in case things turned ugly between the races here. “Being from where we’re from, 1 always think about retaliation,” said Mr. Conlin, who works as an aircraft mechanic at Boeing, one of the region’s largest employers. “You know, when one ethnic group retaliates against another ethnic group. In New York, there’s always retaliation.” But Mr. Conlin said he admired the response of the victims’ families, families, who forgave the attacker. At the bar, a newly engaged couple, Darcy Nelson, 43, and Lee Powell, 33, both Lowcountry natives, spoke with feeling about the pride they felt in their city’s peaceful response to the massacre massacre thus far, and the intensified spirit of neighborliness that seems to have pervaded the place. Mr. Powell said his mother had hugged a black gas station attendant on Thursday morning. “It’s hard to be more polite than we already are, but we are hiking the extra time,” he said. “We were all attacked.” The couple said they were involved involved in organizing an event set for dusk on Sunday in which thousands are expected to span the Ravenel Bridge, holding hands in a sign of peace. “The response of the victims’ families was impactful,” said Mr. Powell, a general contractor. Their loving response, he said, neutralized the hateful message behind the attacks. “It took his power away, and strengthened the community as a whole, and allowed us to say, ‘This is something something we are not.’” themselves as topics of conversation conversation on the campaign trail after Wednesday’s deadly shooting, which took the lives of nine people people gathered for Bible study at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. Both Republicans and Democrats have scrambled to pay respects to the victims, but also to take a stance that may attract attract voters. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee, nominee, took to Twitter on Saturday to press South Carolina to remove remove the Confederate flag flying near its state capitol. On the Democratic side, Martin Martin O’Malley spoke out for gun control on Friday, sending a strongly worded email to supporters supporters calling for a federal assault assault weapons ban, stricter background background checks and measures to tamp down straw-buying. In 2013, when he was governor of Maryland, Maryland, Mr. O’Malley signed similar measures into law, making his state one of the most tightly controlled controlled in the country.

of small but well-regarded jazz clubs notably the East Shore Live Jazz Cafe founded by the saxophonist Liu Yuan former sideman to China's original rock star Cui Jian And the jazz scene is growing It's definitely evolved in terms of musicianship and the amount of original music being produced said Lawrence Ku Chinese-American saxophonist based in Shanghai who previously lived in Beijing There are many more younger musicians now that can really play that really have handle on the   language With the arrival of Blue Note jazz audiences will have access to higher tier of artists with the booking and tal ent buying done from the company s of fice in New York We feel it is only through the intro duction of the pinnacle of jazz perform ances that we are able to foster growth within the local jazz scene and the next generation of Chinese jazz musicians Bao Zhong Lun the general manager of Winbright Culture and Media wrote in an email It is through the Blue Note Jazz Clubs that we aim to generate more widespread social and cultural recognition of jazz music amongst mu sic fans in China It's not uncommon for an artist to ap pear across the network of Blue Note clubs The headliner at the original Blue Note this week is the pianist Robert Glasper who has the top jazz album on he s also scheduled to perform in July at Blue Note Milan The addition of club in the middle of the Pacific Ocean should also help tour ing musicians who will be able to per form in Hawaii as part of an Asian tour We'll be able to save money on in ternational flights Mr Bensusan said   which will make it more affordable to bring musicians to Hawaii It all comes together nicely Blue Note Hawaii will open at the Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort in room with an entertainment pedigree For four decades it

apart from special events Renovations including new sound and lighting systems will cost in excess of million Mr Bensusan said Outrigger Resorts will be partner in the new club through licensing agree ment And given the importance of Asian tourism to Hawaii there have been roughly 1.5 million visitors from Japan in each of the last three years ac   cording to state statistics the new club should have some synergy with Blue Note locations in the Far East The number of Chinese visitors to Hawaii is growing said Barbara Camp bell the vice president for retail leasing and property management for Outrig ger Enterprises Group It'll be very strategic brand move for the Blue Note And Outrigger too is expanding throughout Asia Pacific This is great global expansion strategy for both com panies Hawaii has its share of jazz musicians but hardly any dedicated clubs and none with the cachet or resources of the Blue Note The perennial challenges for promoter in the islands are geography and demographics Unlike Beijing or Tokyo Hawaiian cities have small res ident population which intensifies the need to court tourist groups But the support of local fans and musicians will also be key believe we re going to be pleas antly surprised by the reception we get from the resident market Ms Camp bell said There's been so much re- gentrification of Waikiki that locals are more comfortable coming out It seems likely that the club s pro   gramming will make some provision for Hawaiian music especially given the crossover success of slack-key guitar popular local genre Blue Note Hawaii would be natural fit for someone like Jake Shimabukuro local-born ukulele ace who draws from jazz fusion and has large following in Japan The relationship between the original Blue Note and its Japanese offshoots suggests model for the two forth coming clubs Along with creating work for touring artists the locations in Ja pan have helped cultivate an enthusi astic audience for jazz and not

In what sense? I don’t come out of a conventional academic background. I didn’t have the traditional training for this. Andrew does, and what he also has is an ethnographer’s approach, an engagement with all the other aspects and dimensions of fashion and costume. In other words, the sense that fashion is not just about clothes? There was always this possibility of interpreting interpreting fashion in a more conceptual way. Historically, the subject matter was feminized feminized and ephemeral. The Costume Institute Institute has always been popular, but it had its own specific audience. That was true even before the Diana Vreeland days. Luckily for us, in terms of timing, my former boss, Richard Martin, and 1 came along at a time when the rise in academic and scholarly standards for studying fashion coincided with other things happening in the arts and in academia. Like gender studies? There was a shift in how people were looking looking at fashion culturally, and also the way fine artists were dealing with it in popular culture and imagery. The Pop moment. Right. Once the “fine arts” felt that fashion was a visual language in which ideas of all kinds could be teased out, that made working working in the field so much easier. Was there a show you always wished you’d been able to do but that got away? Actually, the show I’d always wanted to do — I didn’t see any realistic possibility of doing it — was an exhibition about 19thand 19thand 20th-century silhouettes seen only through black clothes. One of the things you realize as a costume curator is that women are willing to embrace a more radical silhouette if it comes in black. A woman can amortize a black silhouette. No one’s going to say, “Oh, she’s wearing that brown dress again.” In fact, you ended up doing a show very much like that. Yes. “Death Becomes Her” [an exhibition of mourning clothes in 2014-15] came about because, as we researched the other show, one of my colleagues noticed that materials of the dresses we were looking at suggested suggested mourning clothes: mourning crepe, matte black wool. So we ended up doing a version of that original dream show after all. All curators have wish lists, an object they burn to own. What was yours? We’re lucky.

A Storm Called Penny Hits Edinburgh She pulls no punches, whether it’s cupcakes or social media. and others, and she still has infectious infectious energy. She expresses herself herself vigorously onstage and off, and seems in equal measure frusBy frusBy STEVEN McELROY Edinburgh — In certain ways, Penny Arcade is a quintessential New Yorker. She’s a pink-haired former Warhol superstar who can say “been there, done that” about a great many things (and does). And she’s a no-holds-barred performer, unafraid to let loose with an opinion about the gentrification gentrification of the Lower East Side, where she has lived in the same apartment for more than 30 years, or the negative impact of all those cute Manhattan bakeries pushing artisanal cupcakes. “ New York has gone from being the Big Apple to being the Big Cupcake,? she complained at one point in “Longing Lasts Longer,” her show that recently completed a run at the annual Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The cupcakes are symbolic of gentrification, but are they also transforming us into zombies who roam the streets in a constant sugar coma, having lost the ability to think for ourselves? Though it is in some ways New York City-centric, “Longing” hits on wide-ranging themes, including including her general feeling that television television and media have made people complacent. (“Hitting ‘like’ on Facebook: That?s not activism?) Her ideas seemed to land here. The show received good reviews and won the Fringe First and Herald Herald Angel awards, coveted prizes in a festival that includes hundreds hundreds of productions. “I’m like Jimi Hendrix,” she said, nursing a cocktail after a late-August show. She was sitting in a beer garden adjacent to the theater where she had been performing. performing. “I’m the kind of artist who is more embraced, more respected respected outside of America,” she said. Indeed, Penny Arcade, whose real name is Susana Ventura, is frustrated with the city she calls home. “I think the art scene in New York is very elitist,? she said. “I’m working class. I speak from a working-class point of view, and I?m the scariest thing that?s possible possible in America: an intelligent articulate articulate woman speaking from my own experience who is not representing representing a specific minority.” Nonetheless, she hasn’t slowed down over the decades. Now 65, she has been at it since the 1960s, when she cut her teeth working with John Vaccaro, Quentin Crisp fund-raising Friends of the Costume Institute Institute and Anna Wintour, we’ve got a good war chest. So we have the ability to go out into the market and be quite aggressive in seeking objects. Still, the most vexing thing for any American curator is export laws. Frequently, while we’re successful at auction, auction, local laws make it impossible to get certain things home. This happened to us not long ago with a silver 18th-century dress. Though it was clearly French, it had been found in a Scottish house. So while we were successful in buying it, ultimately it was detained for three years in England until a consortium of British institutions was put together to keep it there. To this day, it kills me, because there’s nothing else in the collection that is quite like it. What is the first thing you plan to do on Jan. 9? Do you mean after the face-lift? NIGHT OUT WITH PENNY ARCADE world. During “Longing,” she was constantly constantly in motion, delivering her clever political monologue while her longtime collaborator and dramaturge, Steve Zehentner, stood in a comer of the stage running running sound (snippets of rock and pop that vibrantly underscored the performance). Outside, Mr. Zehentner seemed the more practical of the pair, reminding reminding her when she needed to leave and when to rest her voice. They bickered like siblings at times, as when she wanted to share 2016 plans for “Longing” in New York, even though it wasn’t confirmed (a November run at the Soho Theater in London, however, is very much official). J ust as she is in the show. Penny Arcade is something of a gale force in person; it cannot be easy to tell her no. “I never fight with Penny, I just retreat,? Mr. Zehentner said. She hit him under the table. About an hour into her cocktail, a group of exuberant young people people suddenly appeared. “Penny, can we come and chill?? asked Cara Kinniburgh, 20, who had been handing out fliers for “Longing? and other shows during the festival. She and her friends were clearly smitten with Penny Arcade. “1 feel so close to you,” said Neil Anderson, 18, another another leaflet-spreader. “I feel that you understand me more than some people who are younger than you but they’re living in a completely different state of mind.? The scene was notable given that Penny Arcade had gone off script that night to grouse about one reviewer who found “Longing? “Longing? too critical of young people. Young folks today, she said, are placed on a conveyor belt and expected expected to achieve as quickly as possible, to make big life decisions before they are ready. “Whereas some people want to represent that I’m critical of young people. I’m trying to fight against what is being done to them,? she said. “No one is addressing addressing the adventure they feel in their souls.” She may not initially strike you as the maternal type, but she is full of surprises. “We need more people like you,” she said to Mr. Anderson. “You’re open and alive.”",9/13/2015,"('about', 'the', 'gentrification')","('the', 'lower', 'east')","[' And she’s a no-holds-barred performer, unafraid to let loose with an opinion about the gentrification gentrification of the Lower East Side, where she has lived in the same apartment for more than 30 years, or the negative impact of all those cute Manhattan bakeries pushing artisanal cupcakes.']", And shes a noholdsbarred performer unafraid to let loose with an opinion about the gentrification gentrification of the Lower East Side where she has lived in the same apartment for more than 30 years or the negative impact of all those cute Manhattan bakeries pushing artisanal cupcakes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
744,1933962952,"In Chelsea, a Great Wealth Divide CONTINUED FROM PAGE I Avenue between 14th and 34th Streets, could be the poster neighbor!***! for what Mayor Bill de Blasio calls the tale of two cities. While the average household income income in Chelsea has climbed exponentially, exponentially, the income at Elliot Houses, the housing project where Ms. Waters lives, has remained remained more or less steady. Census and city figures show that the average househiild income in Chelsea, about S 140,000, is almost five times the average average for households in public housing in the area. The neighborhood now ranks among those in the city with the greatest income inequality, according to the Furman Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy Policy at New York University, as the share of households in the highest income brackets — over $250,000 — has grown. With hyper-gentrification has come hyper-anxiety, hyper-anxiety, and not just in Chelsea. The administration of Mayor de Blasio, a Democrat, Democrat, plans to rezone parts of the city to build both affordable and market-rate housing, spurring passionate protests in East New York and other comers of the city where residents worry that the envisioned envisioned development will end up displacing poor, longtime tenants. And the mayor’s plan to generate more revenue for the New York City Housing Authority, known as Nycha, by leasing land within housing projects for mixedincome mixedincome housing has fueled longstanding fears that public housing buildings may ultimately ultimately be steamrollered by the hot real estate market — privatized or demolished to make room for richer New Yorkers. ‘Ms Nycha giving up public housing?” a resident of Wyckoff Gardens in Boerum Hill. Brooklyn, one of the housing projects where some of the new housing will be built, asked at a meeting this month of residents residents with officials from the agency. “Are we guaranteed that people here will keep their apartment?” asked another. in LONG-GENTRIFIED Chelsea, the worst fears have yet to come true. The housing projects — Fulton Houses (between 16th and 19th Streets and Ninth and Tenth Avenues) Avenues) and the neighboring Elliot and Chelsea Chelsea Houses (in the mid-20s) — with about 2,000 apartments combined, are still there, as they have been since the 1940s (Elliot) and ’60s (Fulton and Chelsea). The brick buildings have deteriorated, however, under under the weight of time and as the Housing Authority’s maintenance budget has fallen short, although city officials say they remain remain committed to preserving public housing. housing. And the neighborhood around them has metamorphosed into an area of luxury apartment towers, renovated storefronts and offices, and spectacular public spaces, like the High Line, leaving some public housing residents feeling both lucky and doomed. Barbara Sanchez, 42, who grew up at Fulton Houses during Chelsea’s unsavory history of rampant drug-dealing and prostitution prostitution on some streets, still marvels that she can let her 11-year-old daughter walk a few blocks home from school on her own, or that they can visit parks she once shunned. “You could not walk in the park because of drugs,” she said of a small park on 17th Street “Now, people lunch, jog through, and people are sitting out with their Mac.” A report commissioned by the city and released in May studied the effects of gentrification gentrification on public housing residents and found benefits like safer streets and higher performing schools and students for those in wealthier settings. Coexistence, the researchers researchers found, also led to higher annual earnings for public housing households in high-income areas than their counterparts in poor neighborhoods. But there were downsides. “The residents felt profound anxiety,” said Ingrid Gould Ellen, director of the Furman Center and principal investigator of the study, of which Abt Associates was co-author. “They appreciated the safety but they felt a loss, and daily expenses were greater and they felt great alienation.” In interviews, residents noted that gone were the old mom-and-pop stores, the bodegas, bodegas, the low-rise buildings and the gathIslands gathIslands in a Sea of Ever-Expanding Wealth Residents of public housing feel increasingly isolated from and threatened by the hyper-gentrification of Chelsea.

Old standbys like lunch counters and delis, inexpensive fishmongers and butchers, laundromats and convenience stores have grown scarcer, or disappeared altogether, amid the proliferation of multimillion-dollar multimillion-dollar condos, tech companies like Google and fancy restaurants imbuing the area with the ambience of the meatpacking meatpacking district to the south. Contrasts abound. On one block, yellow school buses line up on Ninth Avenue at pickup time in front of Public School 33. A block away on 10th Avenue, a parade of Cadillac Escalade S.U.V.s do the same in front of Avenues: The World School, a prekindergarten-to-12th-grade prekindergarten-to-12th-grade private school that opened in 2012, where annual tuition is $44,000. As the old Western Beef supermarket turned into the Apple store with the glass staircase, and the pizza place into an eyebrow eyebrow salon, many residents said they had lost a sense of belonging. Ms. Sanchez spoke of the loss of an ethnic ethnic enclave when most residents of the area were from Puerto Rico, where her parents came from. Now, she said, she travels to Delancey Street on the Lower East Side to shop for her Puerto Rican dishes as she tries to impart her culture to her daughter and 13-year-old son. Juwan Stone, a resident of Elliot Houses who aspires to become an actor, spoke of sometimes overwhelming change. “All the attention is on the businesses,” he said. “You walk past a scaffold and you wonder, What are they going to build now?” The neighborhood feels welcoming in varying degrees, Mr. Stone said. He has worked summer jobs in the High Line park nearby and said he and his friends appreciated appreciated the free concerts and other entertainment entertainment the park offered. But he said some upscale retailers around him were “stores I feel would be uncomfortable to go in.” The struggle with affordability has left some young people in public housing knowing that their neighborhood will not be theirs for long. Ms. Waters’s grandson, Justin Waters, 27, a computer systems analyst analyst for the Hudson Guild, a community agency, said he did not see himself staying in Chelsea despite the advantages of the location. “Every single year, prices increase,” increase,” he said. “You shouldn’t constantly struggle to live somewhere. At that point you’re not even enjoying it” the chasm between the market rents and what is affordable for most in public housing would preclude even the upwardly mobile in the projects from staying in the neighborhood when they seek to move to private housing. Even former newcomers once viewed as gentrifiers have been priced out. Art galleries, which came to the scene starting in the 1990s, have been closing or leaving for cheaper rents, said Councilman Corey Johnson, a Democrat who represents represents Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen and the West Village. “A ton of small independent art galleries are fleeing to the Lower East Side and Brooklyn because building owners are asking exorbitantly more in west Chelsea,” he said. Despite a construction boom — Chelsea had the highest number of residential units authorized by new building permits by 2014, according to the Furman Center — the rental supply hasn’t kept up with demand. demand. The median asking rent was S3.490 in 2014, the fourth highest in the city, officials officials at the center said. Public housing is not the only low- and middle-income stronghold. Penn South, a major cooperative of middle-income housing housing with more than 2,800 apartments, and the rent-regulated apartment stock also help Chelsea maintain economic diversity. But the city has lost many more rentregulated rentregulated apartments than have been built over the last two decades, especially now in areas like Chelsea, where market renLs are high enough to enable landlords under Clockwise from top: Darlene Waters lives at the Elliot Houses, a housing project in Chelsea; decades-old public housing, left, still stands as luxury apartment towers sprout; Councilman Corey Johnson represents Chelsea as well as Hell’s Kitchen and the West Village; it was hoped that offices of tech companies, like Google, would create jobs for local residents, but relatively few have materialized. Residents of public housing surrounded by affluence feel lucky but also doomed. the state rent law to take apartments out of regulation when there are vacancies. “The huge loss in rent-regulated units, paired with an influx of luxury rentals, leaves families with few options to stay in their community,” said Banka Williams, deputy director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development The ever-rising market rates for both homes and businesses have also driven out Chelsea?s once thriving gay community, Mr. Johnson said, citing the departure of gay clubs like Rawhide. •Chelsea has become much less gay,” said Mr. Johnson, who is gay. “People started moving to Hell’s Kitchen, and now people are going to the outer boroughs.” Mr. Johnson, who lived in Massachusetts Massachusetts public housing while growing up, said he, too, had been affected by higher housing housing costs. In 2003, he lived in a studio for S900 a month. Five years ago, he moved to another studio across the street where monthly rent was $1,750. He currently pays nearly $1,000 more — $2,700 — for the same 319-square-foot unit. As government-subsidized tenants, public public housing residents are protected by a federal policy that requires them to pay no more than 30 percent of their income in rent. But the fear of displacement persists nevertheless. Three years ago, the city took a parking lot from Elliot and Chelsea Houses to build 168 apartments for low-tomiddle-income low-tomiddle-income households, and it now plans another affordable building, at a parking lot and compactor yard at Fulton Houses, Housing Authority officials said. “It’d be stupid not to think that, because eventually it will happen,” Ms. Sanchez, of Fulton Houses, said. “A company may say, we have enough to buy Nycha out There’s somebody out there who’s probably saying, saying, ‘How do we do this,’ because it’s prime real estate.” as zip codes get richer, there are other consequences. Mr. Johnson noted that he did not get as much discretionary money to spend as his Council counterparts representing poorer districts. In 2012, the Hudson Guild, which operates operates on Nycha grounds and at other sites, lost half its day-care program when the Bloomberg administration based funding for free and low-cost child care programs on area income, said Ken Jockers, the guild’s executive director. (The Council restored restored the money, he said, and the center eventually won a federal Head Start grant to continue the program.) “A Zl P code analysis doesn’t account for block-by-block nuances,” Mr. Jockers said. “Even now, when the city looks at lowincome lowincome neighborhoods in the city, which informs so much of city policy, that often disregards the fact that if you’re a poor person in Chelsea, you’re just as poor as the person living in Bushwick.” Some Chelsea businesses have tried to bridge the divide. Mr. Jockers said the fashion company Tommy Hilfiger USA and I AC/Interactive Corporation, the Internet media conglomerate controlled by Barry Diller, have made multiyear, five- and sixfigure sixfigure money commitments to the guild’s programs, which mostly serve public housing housing residents and also draw volunteers and mentors from local companies.

They said the school moved to Chelsea Chelsea looking for a large space and offerings that could enrich the student experience, like the sports facilities at Chelsea Piers, the High Line and the arts scene. The officials promise more aid as Avenues Avenues expands to a second building nearby in 2018, and it has just created a position for someone to work full time on community community engagement. “It’s based on our belief that our students will learn more by being part of our community,” said Gardner Dunnan, Dunnan, the academic dean. To expand Chelsea Market, the food and office complex on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets, Jamestown Properties Properties negotiated with the city a pledge of more than SI million over four years for a technology training program for public housing youth so they can compete for jobs in the area, as well as SI2 million for the High Line and about S5 million for a fund to build affordable housing.

2622,1933961859,"In Chelsea, a Great Wealth Divide CONTINUED FROM PACE I Avenue between 14th and 34 th Streets, could be the poster neighborhood for what Mayor Bill de Blasio calls the tale of two cities. While the average household income income In Chelsea has climbed exponentially, exponentially, the Income at Klliot Houses, the housing project where Ms. Waters lives, has remained remained more or less steady. Census and city figures show that the average household income in Chelsea, about SI40.000, is almost five times the average average for households in public housing in the area. The neighborhood now ranks among those in the city with the greatest income inequality, according to the Furman Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy Policy at New York University, as the share of households in the highest income brackets — over $250,000 — has grown. With hyper-gentrification has come hyper-anxiety, hyper-anxiety, and not just in Chelsea. The administration of Mayor de Blasio. a Democrat, Democrat, plans to rezone parts of the city to build both affordable and market-rate housing, spurring passionate protests in East New York and other comers of the city where residents worry that the envisioned envisioned development will end up displacing poor, longtime tenants. And the mayor’s plan to generate more revenue for the New York City Housing Authority, known as Nycha, by leasing land within housing projects for mixedincome mixedincome housing has fueled longstanding fears that public housing buildings may ultimately ultimately be steamrollered by the hot real estate market — privatized or demolished to make room for richer New Yorkers. “Is Nycha giving up public housing?? a resident of Wyckoff Gardens in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, one of the housing projects where some of the new housing will be built, asked at a meeting this month of residents residents with officials from the agency. “Are we guaranteed that people here will keep their apartment?? asked another. IN long-cENTRI FI ED Chelsea, the worst fears have yet to come true. The housing projects — Fulton Houses (between 16th and 19th Streets and Ninth and Tenth Avenues) Avenues) and the neighboring Elliot and Chelsea Chelsea Houses (in the mid-20s) — with about 2,000 apartments combined, are still there, as they have been since the 1940s (Elliot) and ’60s (Fulton and Chelsea). The brick buildings have deteriorated, however, under under the weight of time and as the Housing Authority’s maintenance budget has fallen short, although city officials say they remain remain committed to preserving public housing. housing. And the neighborhood around them has metamorphosed into an area of luxury apartment towers, renovated storefronts and offices, and spectacular public spaces, like the High Line, leaving some public housing residents feeling both lucky and doomed. Barbara Sanchez, 42, who grew up at Fulton Houses during Chelsea’s unsavory history of rampant drug-dealing and prostitution prostitution on some streets, still marvels that she can let her 11-year-old daughter walk a few blocks home from school on her own, or that they can visit parks she once shunned. “You could not walk in the park because of drugs,? she said of a small park on 17th Street “Now, people lunch, jog through, and people are sitting out with their Mac.? A report commissioned by the city and released in May studied the effects of gentrification gentrification on public housing residents and found benefits like safer streets and higher performing schools and students for those in wealthier settings. Coexistence, the researchers researchers found, also led to higher annual earnings for public housing households in high-income areas than their counterparts in poor neighborhoods. But there were downsides. “The residents felt profound anxiety,? said Ingrid Gould Ellen, director of the Furman Center and principal investigator of the study, of which Abt Associates was co-author. “They appreciated the safety but they felt a loss, and daily expenses were greater and they felt great alienation.?

As the old Western Beef supermarket turned into the Apple store with the glass staircase, and the pizza place into an eyebrow eyebrow salon, many residents said they had lost a sense of belonging. Ms. Sanchez spoke of the loss of an ethnic ethnic enclave when most residents of the area were from Puerto Rico, where her parents came from. Now, she said, she travels to Delancey Street on the Lower East Side to shop for her Puerto Rican dishes as she tries to impart her culture to her daughter and 13-year-old son. Juwan Stone, a resident of Elliot Houses who aspires to become an actor, spoke of sometimes overwhelming change. “All the attention is on the businesses,? he said. “You walk past a scaffold and you wonder, What are they going to build now?? The neighborhood feels welcoming in varying degrees, Mr. Stone said. He has worked summer jobs in the High Line park nearby and said he and his friends appreciated appreciated the free concerts and other entertainment entertainment the park offered.

At that point you’re not even enjoying it” the chasm between the market rents and what is affordable for most in public housing would preclude even the upwardly mobile in the projects from staying in the neighborhood when they seek to move to private housing. Even former newcomers once viewed as gentrifiers have been priced out. Art galleries, which came to the scene starting in the 1990s, have been closing or leaving for cheaper rents, said Councilman Corey Johnson, a Democrat who represents represents Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen and the West Village. “A ton of small independent art galleries are fleeing to the Lower East Side and Brooklyn because building owners are asking exorbitantly more in west Chelsea,? he said. Despite a construction boom — Chelsea had the highest number of residential units authorized by new building permits by 2014, according to the Furman Center — the rental supply hasn’t kept up with demand. demand. The median asking rent was S3,490 in 2014, the fourth highest in the city, officials officials at the center said. Public housing is not the only low- and middle-income stronghold. Penn South, a major cooperative of middle-income housing housing with more than 2,800 apartments, and the rent-regulated apartment stock also help Chelsea maintain economic diversity. But the city has lost many more rentregulated rentregulated apartments than have been built over the last two decades, especially now in areas like Chelsea, where market rents are high enough to enable landlords under Clockwise from top: Darlene Waters lives at the Elliot Houses, a housing project in Chelsea; decades-old public housing, left, still stands as luxury apartment towers sprout; Councilman Corey Johnson represents Chelsea as well as Hell’s Kitchen and the West Village; it was hoped that offices of tech companies, like Google, would create jobs for local residents, but relatively few have materialized. Residents of public housing surrounded by affluence feel lucky but also doomed. the state rent law to take apartments out of regulation when there are vacancies. “The huge loss in rent-regulated units, paired with an influx of luxury rentals, leaves families with few options to stay in their community,? said Barika Williams, deputy director of the Association for Neighborh?x»d and Housing Development. The ever-rising market rates for both homes and businesses have also driven out Chelsea’s once thriving gay community, Mr. Johnson said, citing the departure of gay clubs like Rawhide. “Chelsea has become much less gay? said Mr. Johnson, who is gay. “People started moving to Hell’s Kitchen, and now people are going to the outer boroughs.? Mr. Johnson, who lived in Massachusetts Massachusetts public housing while growing up. said he, too. had been affected by higher housing housing costs. In 2003, he lived in a studio for S900 a month. Five years ago, he moved to another studio across the street where monthly rent was SI,750. He currently pays nearly $1,000 more — $2,700 — for the same 319-square-foot unit. As government-subsidized tenants, public public housing residents are protected by a federal policy that requires them to pay no more than 30 percent of their income in rent. But the fear of displacement persists nevertheless. Three years ago, the city took a parking lot from Elliot and Chelsea Houses to build 168 apartments for low-tomiddle-income low-tomiddle-income households, and it now plans another affordable building, at a parking lot and compactor yard at Fulton Houses, Housing Authority officials said. “It’d be stupid not to think that, because eventually it will happen,? Ms. Sanchez, of Fulton Houses, said. “A company may say, we have enough to buy Nycha out. There’s somebody out there who’s probably saying, saying, ‘How do we do this,’ because it’s prime real estate.” as zip codes get richer, there are other consequences. Mr. Johnson noted that he did not get as much discretionary money to spend as his Council counterparts representing poorer districts. In 2012, the Hudson Guild, which operates operates on Nycha grounds and at other sites, lost half its day-care program when the Bloomberg administration based funding for free and low-cost child care programs on area income, said Ken Jockers, the guild’s executive director. (The Council restored restored the money, he said, and the center eventually won a federal Head Start grant to continue the program.) “A Zl P code analysis doesn’t account for block-by-block nuances,? Mr. Jockers said. “Even now, when the city looks at lowincome lowincome neighborhoods in the city, which informs so much of city policy, that often disregards the fact that if you’re a poor person in Chelsea, you’re just as poor as the person living in Bushwick.? Some Chelsea businesses have tried to bridge the divide. Mr. Jockers said the fashion company Tommy Hilfiger USA and I AC/Interactive Corporation, the Internet media conglomerate controlled by Barry Diller, have made multiyear, five- and sixfigure sixfigure money commitments to the guild’s programs, which mostly serve public housing housing residents and also draw volunteers and mentors from local companies. The Avenues school, which opened in a renovated warehouse and currently serves 1,229 students, mostly from outside the neighborhood, gives nearly $1 million in financial financial aid to 35 students from its community community board district, officials at the school said. They said the school moved to Chelsea Chelsea looking for a large space and offerings that could enrich the student experience, like the sports facilities at Chelsea Piers, the High Line and the arts scene.

Two of the first works in “A Constellation,” Constellation,” organized by Amanda Hunt, an assistant curator at the Studio Museum, Museum, are a geometrically abstract painting by Al Loving, “Variations on a Six-Sided Object” (1967), and a figurative figurative sculpture, “Mother and Child” (1993), by Elizabeth Catlett. These two poles of 20th-century American art — abstraction and figuration — also signify signify the African-American perspective on the movements, as articulated by these two revered (now deceased) artists. They raise questions like, Is there such a thing as black abstraction? (An issue also addressed in an exhibition exhibition of Stanley Whitney’s paintings at the Studio Museum last year and in an Alma Thomas retrospective opening at the Tang Museum upstate next month.) They also ask, What does it mean in art to represent bodies that have been marked as property and by racist violence? Throughout “A Constellation,” you see reverberations and responses to these questions by younger and living “A Constellation,” “Black: Color, Material, Material, Concept,” “Lorraine O?Grady: Art Is ... ” and “Marc Andre Robinson: Twice Told” continue through March 6 at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street; 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. 20 Years Ago The biggest surprise in the opening episode of the final season of “Downton Abbey” wasn’t about “Downton” at all; it was — ohmygod, there’s Wickham! Wickham, you old scoundrel, is that really really you? And has it really been 20 years? It was 20 years ago this month, as it happens, that the television costume drama genre hit its high-water mark (muddy hems and all) with the broadcast broadcast of “Pride and Prejudice,? a co-production co-production of the B BC and A?

But the connection to the exploited and violated black body is made even more explicit in Nona Faustine’s “From Her Body Sprang Their Greatest Wealth” (2013), in which Ms. Faustine photographed herself nude and standing standing on a crate at the intersection of Water and Wall Streets in Manhattan, the site of a slave market in earlier centuries. Aaron Fowler’s wonderful “Family” (2015), an assemblage that uses materials from paint to Frosted Flakes breakfast cereal and a bamboo earring, depicts the artist leading his family “to the promised land” (according (according to a gallery handout) but also refers to the ruptures of the black family under slavery, recently addressed by Ta-Nehisi Coates in an essay in The Atlantic, “The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration.?

Meanwhile, Sondra Perry’s video “Double, Quadruple, Etcetera, Etcetera 1” (2013) is an intense, manic image of a dancing figure whose body has been digitally erased, so that only a whirling mass, with black hair, remains. The political nature of black hair has been addressed by observers from Malcolm X to Chris Rock, in his 2009 documentary, documentary, “Good Hair,” but Ms. Perry’s work also suggests the vibrancy of spirit worlds, African dervishes and the linover linover three nights on A?E, and Mr. O’Connor O’Connor quibbled only about the pacing: “Scattered portions of this handsome production might seem a bit slow for American viewers (British imports are often snipped and speeded up for consumption consumption here),? he wrote. “There are perhaps too many languorous walks across the meadows, and one or two ornately ornately choreographed dances seem to go on forever.” It turns out that American viewers not only didn?t mind the languor, but the old VCR also got a workout. “P?P” became a phenomenon. Peter M. Nichols, writing in The Times in 1997, said that the A?E mini-series “had viewers vying for quickly depleted supplies of videos after it played on television early last year.” He concluded, “So powerful is the hold of the two-cassette ‘Pride and Prejudice,’ which has sold some 200,000 copies, that it is only half-jokingly reputed to have jeopardized jobs and strained personal relationships.” Writing in The Times earlier that year, the book critic Christopher LehmannHaupt LehmannHaupt nearly placed the mini-series Ell IAN COHEN CX)Ui;riK)N “Corn Mao,” from a series by Zhang Hongtu, at the Queens Museum.

QUEENS Head out to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park for the Queens Museum?s Panorama of the City of New York, and stay for its exhibitions featuring featuring an eclectic mix of artists. The panorama panorama was constructed for the 1964 World’s Fair and remains a marvel. Also on display this winter are works by Zhang Hongtu, in his first United States survey, and an untitled mural by gering ghosts of history. In “Black: Color, Material, Concept,” the palette is reduced, mostly to black and white, but the ideas are rich and diverse. Kameelah Janan Rasheed’s woodblock print “Punctuated Blackness” Blackness” (2013) repeats the word “black” followed by various punctuation marks, to show how a colon, question mark or exclamation point invokes rational analysis or outrage. Rudy Shepherd’s serigraph print “Blacula” (2009) pays homage to the eponymous 1972 blaxploitation blaxploitation film imagining Dracula as an African prince, while Leonardo Drew’s “Number 175” (2015), a beautiful wooden wooden construction painted black, is reminiscent reminiscent of Louise Nevelson’s sculptures but also injects — within this context — race into the conversation. (“Black” also includes minor works by luminaries luminaries like Kerry James Marshall, Kara Walker, Glenn Ligon and Jack Whitten.) Marc Andre Robinson, a former Studio Museum artist-in-residence, makes excellent use of reclaimed wood in a basement installation. His sculpture sculpture “Twice Told” (2015), suspended from the ceiling, uses chair legs glued together to create a dynamic parallelline-drawing parallelline-drawing in space. The title comes from the classic 1903 book “The Souls of Black Folk” by W. E. B. DuBois, who wrote that “one ever feels his two-ness: an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings.” Mr. Robinson’s work is a somewhat literal interpretation, but impressive nonetheless. If the responsibility and strain of being an African-American artist is apparent throughout, this burden is worn lightly in Lorraine O?Grady’s “Art Is ... ” (1983). During the September 1983 African-American Day Parade in Harlem, Ms. O’Grady designed a float and rode up Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard with a group of collaborators dressed in white. They jumped off periodically to hold up gilded picture frames in which spectators could pose with their friends and be photographed by Ms. O’Grady. The resulting images, installed in a row marching around the gallery walls, are sweet, funny and touching. Politics peeks through, at moments: a photograph photograph of a white police officer watching the proceedings; an advertisement for Colt 45 Malt Liquor, which targeted low-income African-American neighborhoods. neighborhoods. Looking at the photographs conjures welcome sensations, however, that are often absent in the recent discourse on race: pride, joy and hope. No wonder Ms. O’Grady’s exhibition has been extended; it is worth visiting the museum for this show alone. above the novel. “Plenty of bad movies have been made of good books, and a fair number of good movies have come from bad books. But a great movie of a great book?” He had missed the production on TV, “but when a friend lent me the tapes,” he wrote, “I did not get free until 1 had watched the entire five-hour production three or four times.” Then he experimented. “Best of all was the way the film spurred me to read the book again after 40 years and to reexperience reexperience as literature the wayward romances.” romances.” He was surprised to find that “the book proved somewhat disappointing at first. As the friend who lent me the tapes rightly put it when I asked him how the book compared with the film, ‘It makes you fear for literature.’ “ ‘Oh! Shocking!’ as Miss Bingley would say. To admit that the literalness of film might surpass the stimulus to the imagination of Austen’s language. ’Abominable!’ ” But there was love for both. “By the end. I’m relieved to report the book’s richness overtakes the film’s,? he wrote. Still, “this reader will never again be able to open the pages of ‘Pride and Prejudice’ Prejudice’ without picturing the actors in this unforgettable television production.” MARY JO MURPHY Mickalene Thomas.

The implementation of the nuclear deal and the lifting of sanctions on Iran, as well as the prisoner exchange, combined to make it a rare, hopeful day for Washington and Tehran. But Iran remains a powerful adversary of America across nearly all the conflicts of the Middle East. President Obama and his successor in the White House will be tested by whether they can find the right balance between cooperation cooperation on nuclear issues and containment of Iranian aggression. The deal will have multiple consequences. consequences. With the lifting of sanctions, Iran becomes a major player in global energy markets. It will also cease to be a political pariah in much of the world. Most important, important, a possible third major Middle East war has been averted and Iran?s bid for nuclear weapons stymied, at least for now. At a time of upheaval in the region, this is an unusual piece of positive news. Despite criticism of the agreement from congressional opponents, there are clear benefits for American security. Iran’s nuclear nuclear program will be frozen for 10 to 15 years now that its plutonium production and uranium enrichment facilities have been largely dismantled. A vast majority of its enriched uranium has been shipped abroad. Tehran will be subject to tight international international supervision and monitoring. The commitments made by Tehran?s lead negotiator. Foreign Minister Mohammad Mohammad Javad Zarif, will be difficult to disavow disavow in the future without major costs to Iran?s global reputation. If it tries to trim or cheat on its obligations, the world will be watching. The return of diplomacy as a preferred tool of American strategy is another of the deal?s most promising results. Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry can take much credit. Their decision toengage in a risky two-year negotiation with arguably arguably our most difficult regional adversary has paid off. By emphasizing the primacy of diplomacy in the wake of the interventions interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Obama A new chapter opens, but challenges remain. believes he is redefining American leadership leadership in the world in a more constructive and realistic way. Despite the nuclear deal’s many promises. promises. however, the road to a more normal American-Iranian relationship will be long and rocky. That is how I saw it when I helped to negotiate sanctions against Iran for the Bush administration a decade ago. It remains true today. One immediate challenge will be to deal with two Iranian governments at once. Mr. Kerry pounded out the agreement with the American-educated Mr. Zarif. who w as backed by Iran’s reformist president, president, Hassan Rouhani. But real power still rests with Iran?s supreme leader. Ayatollah Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a recluse who is supremely supremely distrustful of all things American and closer to the hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Revolutionary Guards Corps than to the reformists. The guards corps?s influence over Iran?s national security strategy has been visible visible since the nuclear deal was announced. In recent weeks. Iran tested ballistic missiles missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Security Council resolutions and fired rockets close to American warships in the Strait of Hormuz. After detaining American sailors last week. Iran released a demeaning video video of the incident. The guards corps is also driving Iran’s continued support for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria and the bloody government of President Bashar al-Assad. It is the guards corps that may be tempted to cheat on Iran’s nuclear nuclear obligations and return to taking American hostages. Dealing with these rival camps will be a challenge. Mr. Kerry is right to test whether Iran will be more cooperative in the negotiations to end the war in Syria and in the fight against the Islamic State. But the administration will need to be equally determined to contain the worst aspects of Iran?s aggression in the region. The president made a start Sunday by announcing sanctions against Iran for its missile tests. Mr. Obama w ill also need to repair our damaged relationships with Israel Israel and Saudi Arabia to limit the mayhem Iran may yet cause in Syria. He should also counter any Iranian attempt to encourage encourage its clients Hezbollah and Hamas to resume rocket attacks on Israel. This will be a difficult set of issues to manage in a polarized election year. Is it too much to hope that some G.O.P. leaders might drop their opposition and help implement implement the deal? Or that more Democrats will back a tough-minded approach approach to Iran?s troublemaking? One thing is clear: The United States will face a major strategic challenge from Iran this year and next. In order to realize the long-term benefits of this historic deal, the United States must continue to balance balance engagement w ith deterrence. □ Nicholas Burns, a professor at the Harvard Harvard Kennedy School and a former under secretary of state, is a visiting fellow at Stanford. MVIlNVt IIJ.NIIIK Protect Female Farmworkers By Jose R. Padilla and David Bacon OAKLAND. CALIF, jk CROSS the country, some 400,000 women, mostly immigrants, / ^ work in agriculture, toiling in fields, nurseries and packing A. JL plants. Such work is backbreaking backbreaking and low -paying. But for many of these women, it is also a nightmare of sexual sexual violence. In a 2010 study from the University of California, Santa Cruz, more than 60 percent percent of the 150 female farmworkers interviewed interviewed said they had experienced some form of sexual harassment. In a 2012 report, report, Human Rights Watch surveyed 52 female farmworkers; nearly all of them had experienced sexual violence, or knew others who had. One woman told investigators investigators that her workplace was called the “field de calzon,? or “field of panties.? As an Iowa immigrant farmworker told her lawyer. “We thought it was normal in the United States that in order to keep your job. you had to have sex.? The reasons behind this epidemic aren?t hard to fathom. Fields are vast and sparsely monitored; workers are often alone. It’s particularly bad for immigrant workers: The Department of Labor estimates estimates that about half of farmworkers don’t have legal immigration papers, which makes them especially vulnerable. So do low wages and competition for jobs: Male farmworkers make an estimated estimated S16.250 a year and female ones S11.250 a year. With depressed wages and so many workers competing for the same job. women are hesitant to complain. The problem is hardly a secret. TWo decades ago the Equal Employment Opportunity Opportunity Commission, along w ith CaliforJosc CaliforJosc R. Padilla is the executive director of California Rural Legal Assistance. David Bacon is the author of “The Right to Stew Home.? Just Saying Yes to the Politics of Drugs Bv Emma Roller E ARLIER this month, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida opened up on a subject he had once chided reporters for asking asking about: his daughter. Noelle. who. he said, “was addicted to drugs.? In a video released by the campaign. Mr. Bush speaks plainly about his daughter?s daughter?s struggle, her time in jail and drug court, and her recovery. “I can look in people’s people’s eyes and I know that they’ve gone through the same thing that Columba and I have,? he said, referring to his wife. Mr. Bush is not the only candidate to share this sort of painful personal experience. experience. Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive executive of Hew lett-Packard, has spoken out about losing her stepdaughter. Lori Ann Fiorina, to “the demons of addiction? at the age of 35. And Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey spoke candidly and emotionally emotionally about a law school friend w ho died of a Percocet overdose. What’s behind this newfound willingness willingness on the candidates? part to talk about the personal toll of addiction? New Hampshire, and the sobering statistics on drug overdoses there, is probably probably part of the answer. Every day. 44 people in the United States die as a result of overdose on prescription prescription painkillers. Every day. nearly 7.000 people are treated in emergency rooms for abusing painkillers. Overdose deaths have been creeping upward since the beginning of the 21st century — especially especially deaths from opiate abuse. In New Hampshire, overdose deaths linked to opiate opiate abuse have more than doubled over the past two years. Ted Gatsas, the Republican mayor of Manchester. N.H.. said he had had many opportunities to talk to Republican candidates, candidates, including Mr. Bush. Mr. Christie. Donald J. Trump. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, about the heroin and prescriptionpainkiller prescriptionpainkiller abuse in his state. He thinks that the overdose problem has been severely severely underestimated, not just in his city Emma Roller, a former reporter for National National Journal, is a contributing opinion writer. This is an article from Campaign Stops at nytimcs.com/campaignstops. nia Rural Legal Assistance, a legal service program that promotes the interests of migrant laborers and the rural poor, created created a joint project to concentrate on sexual harassment in the fields. In 2005, the commission won aS994.000 victory for Olivia Tamayo, a worker at one of California?s largest cattle-feeding operations, operations, who was repeatedly raped by her supervisor. “He took advantage because he knew I wasn?t going to say anything.? she told Ms. Magazine. “It was a trauma that followed me everywhere.? In September, in one of the largest settlements settlements of its kind, the commission won over S17 million for five farmworkers in Florida who had accused their superviThey superviThey endure a nightmare of sexual violence. sors of rape and harassment. Some 18 similar similar cases nationally after 2009 have given women farmworkers $4 million. Yet these cases involve only a tiny percentage percentage of women who work in agriculture. agriculture. Research shows that harassment and abuse are much more widespread — and case-by-case litigation isn’t enough to change that. When women do file complaints, investigations investigations can takes months, even years, which can discourage other women from speaking up. And even when a case is w on. criminal prosecution of the harasser or rapist rarely follows. There are several steps we can take to slow this scourge. Education and outreach are critical — not just for women working in the industry, but also for consumers who can put pressure on the industry to crack down. At the same time, employers themselves often don?t know what’s going on in their own fields. and state, but nationwide. “I just don?t think anybody, until you put the numbers and talk to them about it, knows that it?s this bad across this country.? country.? he said. Nearly 50 years into the “w ar on drugs.? which both Republican and Democratic leaders have w aged in various ways, with various disastrous outcomes, drug overdoses overdoses reached a record high in 2014. From 2001 to 2014. the United States had more than a threefold increase in deaths from opioid pain relievers, and a sixfold increase increase in heroin overdoses, according to the National Institutes of Health. During the same period, overdose deaths from prescription drugs like Valium and Candidates share family tales of addiction for empathy — and votes. Klonopin — sedatives called benzodiazepines benzodiazepines — increased by five times. In speaking about their own experiences. experiences. Republican candidates are not only allowing themselves to be vulnerable in front of voters, they’re also straying from the just-say-no message of Ronald Reagan. Reagan. whose legacy includes a tough legislative legislative stance on drugs and drug sentencing. sentencing. They?re also hoping that voters, especially especially in early primary states, will empathize. empathize. Grant Smith, a lobbyist with Drug Policy Policy Action, said it was remarkable how much airtime addiction was getting. “If you look over the last two decades, we?ve definitely seen a transformation in howelected howelected officials talk about people who use drugs.? he said. Now there?s more empathy. empathy. less scolding. He is glad to see the new rhetoric about addiction, but notes that candidates have become more open about this issue as it has started to take a real toll on largely white communities. “There’s no question that the shift in who is being impacted by overdose and the attendant harms of drug use to rural and suburban communities has made lawmakers lawmakers as well as candidates for office more comfortable talking about these isStill, isStill, many employers do know — and use threats and intimidation to keep their workers quiet. We need stronger laws against retaliation, and protections for undocumented undocumented workers who come forward. The administrative barriers to complaints complaints must also be addressed. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has few offices in rural areas; they?re usually open only when women are working; working; and the staff often don?t speak Spanish. Spanish. much less indigenous languages. What?s more, many government agencies require complaints to be filed online. Many farmworkers do not have access to computers. The commission could make filing complaints easier by setting up a 24/7 hotline in multiple languages, with an actual person answering the phone, instead instead of automated messages. Criminal prosecution of sexual assault cases needs to increase as well. District attorneys attorneys and state prosecutors must step in. making indictments and fining bosses who tolerate harassment. Women will feel safer filing complaints if they know their attackers can’t just walk away. There has been some success along these lines, including including a recent conviction in San Benito. But perhaps the biggest impediment to fighting harassment in the fields is America?s America?s immigration policy itself. Federal regulations regulations forbid legal aid organizations like California Rural Legal Assistance from directly directly representing undocumented people. people. and the illegal nature of their work situations situations makes it difficult for them to come forward. Finding a path tow ard documentation documentation and legal employment for these women would also empower them to report report those who rape and harass them. Last year. California Rural Legal Assistance Assistance settled a S1.3 million case for a farmworker farmworker who was assaulted in a raspberry field, and then sent back to work in her bloody and ripped clothes. “It’s the saddest saddest thing that has happened to me in my life — for me it?s like a wound that?s there.? our client said during the sentencing phase of the case. “I just don?t know how i’ll be able to get out of this trauma.? □ sues,? he said. “It?s just that AfricanAmerican AfricanAmerican communities have endured high overdose rates for decades, and few lawmakers in Washington cared.? At a forum at Southern New Hampshire University earlier this month. Governor Kasich spoke with refreshing candor about what some call this “gentrification of addiction.? “Sometimes I wonder how AfricanAmericans AfricanAmericans must have felt when drugs were awash in their community and nobody nobody watched.? he said. “Now it?s in our communities, and now all of a sudden we’ve got forums, and God bless us. but think about the struggles that other people people had.? So far. the proposed plans from the candidates candidates to combat addiction have remained remained frustratingly vague. Mr. Bush?s plan is one exception: It would increase access to drug courts, w hich allow some nonviolent drug offenders to undergo medical treatment instead of serving jail time, and would also reduce some mandatory mandatory minimum sentences. Beyond criminal justice reform, there is the public health aspect of providing assistance. assistance. The Affordable Care Act requires requires health insurance plans to cover treatment for substance abuse. The Republican Republican candidates who want to repeal Obamacare should answer this question: If you succeed, how will you fund treatment treatment for drug users? Finally, there remains the problem of the government classification of different drugs. The Drug Enforcement Administration. Administration. formally if not informally, still considers considers marijuana more dangerous and more addictive than the prescription painkillers and sedatives that accounted for more than 25,000 overdose deaths in 2014. In Manchester, as Mayor Gatsas welcomes welcomes a parade of candidates, he also sees plenty of constituents dealing with the ravages of addiction. Mothers crying, parents parents writing obituaries that frankly state that their sons and daughters died from heroin overdoses. “With this epidemic, it?s crossed every boundary. It’s young to old, rich to poor, white to black.? he said. “I tell them. ‘If it hasn’t affected you yet. just wait. It will.? ? It?s almost as if it’s a universal issue — which is something the candidates are starting to realize too. □ DAVID BROOKS Time Fora Conspiracy! Members of the Republican governing class are like cowering freshmen at halftime halftime of a high school football game. Some are part of the Surrender Caucus, sitting sullenly on their stools resigned to the likelihood that their team is going to get crushed. Some are thinking of jumping ship to the Trump campaign with an alacrity alacrity that would make rats admire and applaud. applaud. Rarely has a party so passively accepted accepted its own self-destruction. Sure. Donald Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are now riding high in some meaningless head-to-head polls against Hillary Clinton, but the odds are the nomination of either would lead to a party-decimating general election. The Tea Party, Ted Cruz?s natural vehicle, vehicle, has 17 percent popular support, according according to Gallup. The idea that most women, independents or mainstream order-craving order-craving suburbanites would back a guy who declares his admiration for Vladimir Putin is a mirage. The idea that the G.O.P. can march into the 21st century intentionally alienating every person of color is borderline insane. Worse is the prospect that one of them might somehow win. Very few presidents are so terrible that they genuinely endanger endanger their own nation, but TYump and Cruz would go there and beyond. Trump is a solipsistic solipsistic branding genius whose “policies? have no contact with Planet Earth and who would be incapable of organizing a coalition. coalition. domestic or foreign. Cruz would be as universally off-putting as he has been in all his workplaces. He?s always been good at tearing things down but incompetent when it comes to putting things together. So maybe it?s time for governing Republicans Republicans to actually do something. Yes. I?m talking to you state legislators, or local committeepersons, or members of Congress Congress and all your networks of donors and supporters. If MoveOn can organize, if the Tea Party can organize, if Justin Bieber can build a gigantic social media movement. movement. why are you incapable of any collective collective action at all? What?s needed is a grass-roots movement movement that stands for governing conservatism. conservatism. built both online and through rallies, and gets behind a single candidate sometime sometime in mid- to late February. In politics, if A (Trump) and B (Cruz) savage each other then the benefits often go to CandiReality-based CandiReality-based conservatives can mobilize, too. date C. But there has to be a C. not a C, D. E. F and G. This new movement must come to grips with two realities. First, the electorate has changed. Less-educated voters are in the middle of a tidal wave of trauma. Labor force participation is dropping, wages are sliding, suicide rates are rising, heroin addiction addiction is rising, faith in American institutions institutions is dissolving. Second, the Republican Party is not as antigovernment as its elites think it is. Its members no longer fit into the same old ideological categories. Trump grabbed his lead with an ideological grab bag of gestures. gestures. some of them quite on the left. He is more Huey Long than Calvin Coolidge. Given the current strains on middleand middleand working-class families, many Republican Republican voters want a government that will help the little guy; they just don?t want one that is incompetent, corrupt or infused with liberal social values. In addition, younger voters and collegeeducated collegeeducated voters are more moderate than party leaders. According to one of the smartest conservative analysts. Henry Olsen, somewhere around 35 to 40 percent of the G.O.P. electorate is only “somewhat conservative.? What?s needed is a coalition that combines combines Huey Long. Charles Colson and Theodore Roosevelt: working-class populism. populism. religious compassion and institutional institutional reform. Years ago. reform conservatives were proposing a Sam’s Club Republicanism, which would actually provide concrete policy ideas to help the working class, like wage subsidies, a higher earned-Income tax credit, increased child tax credits, subsidies subsidies for people who wanted to move in search of work and exemption of the first $20,000 in earnings from the Medicaid payroll tax. This would be a conservatism that emphasized social mobility at the bottom. bottom. not cutting taxes at the lop. Maybe it?s time a center-right movement movement actually offered that agenda. And maybe it?s time some Republicans took a stand on w hat is emerging as the central dispute of our time — not between left and right but between open and closed. As the political scientist Matthew MacWilliams has found, the key trait that identifies Trump followers is authoritarianism. authoritarianism. H is central image is a wall. With their emphasis on anger and shutting shutting people out, TYump and Cruz are more like European conservatives than American American ones. Governing conservatism has to offer people a secure financial base and a steady hand up so they can welcome global capitalism w ith hope and a sense of opportunity. That?s the true American tradition. tradition. emphasizing future dynamism not tribal walls. There?s a silent majority of hopeful, practical, programmatic Republicans. Republicans.

SlOE STREET Sunset Park Feels the Undertow of Gentrification By DAVID GONZALEZ For decades, the industrial waterfront of Sunset Park, on the western edge of Brooklyn, was an urban flyover country of sorts, as commuters heading to Manhattan or Staten Island zipped past on the elevated Go wanus Expressway, catching glimpses of auto repair shops, huge warehouses and billboards. But now that waterfront is attracting big investment: Deeppocketed Deeppocketed developers are snatching snatching up properties and announcing announcing plans for cutting-edge tech and design companies, commercial commercial ventures, big-box retailers, restaurants and residential towers. towers. The city — at the urging of developers — has proposed a streetcar line that would snake along the waterfront from Sunset Park to Astoria, Queens. Developers tout their plans as forward-looking, something that : will turn a drab waterfront into a modem, attractive destination and business hub that will generate generate jobs. City officials say the proposed streetcar is needed to meet the needs of 21st-century? commuters and would be welcomed welcomed by working-class residents in areas that are far from the subway, like Red Hook in Brooklyn. Before the big money descended descended on the area, Elizabeth Yeampierre had been working w ith residents, business owners, planners and advocates on various various projects to revive the area, keep rents affordable and retain much-needed jobs in what had been a mostly minority workingclass workingclass community. As the leader of Uprose, a local environmental justice group founded 50 years ago. she pushed for a waterfront park, made busy streets pedestrian-friendly, pedestrian-friendly, helped industrial businesses be more environmentally environmentally aware and prepared the neighborhood for another disaster like Hurricane Sandy. Now. some of those accomplishments accomplishments could displace her neighbors and the workers who may not find a home in a redeveloped redeveloped waterfront, where for-sale signs abound along with other signs proclaiming “innovation.” “innovation.” After years of working with Queens Man Is Held After Stabhings and Chemical Attacks From Page A14 in the neighborhood for decades and heard the officers Firing, said, j “You don’t think that something would happen on the block you’ve walked on for 35 years.?

We made it to the Whitney; Gansevoort Street was like an abandoned set of a longforgotten longforgotten film. Inside the museum we were practically alone.

Behind us in the cool-white vault of museum space, Frank Stella’s enormous, colorful sculptures sculptures screamed “Look at us!” without saying a word.

Mr. Shiffman. who has worked with Uprose, said the new proposals proposals for improved transportation transportation and development in Sunset Park, while cast as improving the area and making it more attractive attractive to business and new residents, have only increased the fear of displacement. “The developers haven?t really reached out and worked closely with groups like Uprose.” he said. “But every step they are taking looks like one that not only leads to displacement of residential communities but the displacement displacement of jobs for working people who live in the adjacent community. community. It looks like the gentrification gentrification of manufacturing.” Ms. Yeampierre can see that on the same block of her group’s headquarters. Down the street, a hotel rose a few years ago, while a new one is being built around the comer. Next to that site, an auto-repair garage lost its lease.

When my mother died in 2001. my sister and I had to sell the Upper West Side co-op apartment apartment in which we grew up and in w hich my parents had lived since 1942. They had done almost no work on the place since about 1950. as far as I can recall. My sister, being the one who lives in New York City, went to the closing closing of the sale. All was going well when, as she reported, she told the buyer that there was “one more little stipulation” that she wanted to put in. His face fell. She said that she and her sister would love to see the apartment when it had been renovated. He kindly agreed, and a few years later when I was visiting New York, we called and he invited us over. It was lovely.

As prisons swelled rapidly between the early 1970s and today, the country has seen another unprecedented, parallel parallel expansion: The museum industry industry has grown at record speed, and art prices at auctions have exploded. exploded. Ms. Fraser recognizes the paradox of staging a show on prison prison conditions in an 18,200-squarefoot 18,200-squarefoot gallery, in a museum that cost S420 million to build. “1 am not sure that on some level it isn?t an absolutely monstrous thing to do.? she said. Artists have examined the apparatus apparatus of criminal justice before, but for most it was just one topic among many. Danny Lyon took photographs in Texas prisons in 1971 but later shifted his focus to a destitute region in China and. more recently, to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Among the artists who have made mass incarceration their life’s pursuit is the African-American African-American couple Keith Calhoun and Chandra McCormick from New Orleans, whose work was exhibited exhibited in the 2015 Venice Biennale.

One of his recent art projects, ?Degrees of Visibility.? was inspired by the controversy over a new jail adjacent adjacent to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Marin Marin County Civic Center, just north of San Francisco. The jail, which was criticized for defiling Wright?s eminent architecture, was eventually built underground. Mr. Hunt’s new series consists of exterior exterior photo shots of prisons juxtaposed juxtaposed with writings and music that cement each facility w ithin its community?s complex history. The prisoners remain invisible to the eye of the viewer. “I always shoot from a public location,? he said, “the gaze of the commuter who doesn?t know what he’s looking looking at.? This was once a fringe issue for artists and institutions, but Ms. Fraser credits increased awareness awareness to new s coverage of prisons like Rikers island and legislative moves toward prison reform. Many museums have expanded their educational departments and raised a new generation of politically politically minded curators. To illustrate the role artists play in the fight, Mr. Hunt insisted that the New Museum give free tickets to people who otherwise couldn?t afford to see his performance, which dealt with New Orleans’s refusal to evacuate the Orleans Parish Prison during Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Hunt said putting pressure on an institution can have a “micro-political effect? that ripples through the art world. The curator at the Newspace Center for Photography in Portland. Portland.

But I?m sure it would have enhanced my enjoyment of “Brodsky/Baryshnikov.? “Brodsky/Baryshnikov.? a theater piece that, as the title makes clear, features the former former ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov Baryshnikov reciting, in Russian, selections selections from the poetry of Joseph Brodsky. Brodsky, who was forcibly exiled from the Soviet Union in 1972, and never returned, was a friend of Mr. Baryshnikov, and “Brodsky/Baryshnikov? is Mr. Baryshnikov’s elegiac tribute to the work of his friend, who died in 1996 at 55. The emphasis is very? much on language: Dance lovers should know that there’s nothing really resembling choreography involved in the show, which is being presented at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. (Not included in the selections from Brodsky’s oeuvre, incidentally. incidentally. is the poem he dedicated to Mr. Baryshnikov that begins. “The classical ballet, let’s say. is beauty?s keep.’’) Directed by Alvis Hermanis. the show takes place in and outside of a somewhat decrepit glass gazebo of sorts, decorated in art nouveau curv es and designed designed by Kristine Jurjane. It might be the foyer of a St. Petersburg Petersburg apartment building; then again, it might not. Mr. Baryshnikov Baryshnikov enters the gazebo from the back and emerges through a pair of doors at the front.

Still, in contrast to most theatrical works presented in foreign languages. languages. we are not listening to dialogue, which can be quickly digested, letting us concentrate mostly on what?s taking place on the stage.

He is arguably most entrancing. entrancing. and most deeply immersed in the language, when he is simply simply sitting on a bench outside the gazebo, rocking slowly back and forth as he recites. (Many of the poems are heard on recordings.) It’s as if the language is a current of energy activating not just his mind but his entire body ; you sense that he feels its presence inside him down to his fingertips. As the evening proceeds, the lights in the gazebo at times flare and flicker as if the electric current current is running down. Electronic music occasionally blares. There is also an old reel-to-reel tape recorder, from which, at a couple of points, we hear a recording of Brodsky himself reading, in a musical, incantatory style that’s quite striking. Yet the selections Mr. Hermanis Hermanis and Mr. Baryshnikov have chosen from Brodsky?s large, diverse oeuvre tend toward the gloomy and wintry. The cruel depredations of time, the inevitability inevitability of aging and mortality are recurring themes. Small wonder that Mr. Baryshnikov barely cracks a smile during the 90minute 90minute running time. The audience, mostly Russianspeaking Russianspeaking from the conversations I heard around me before the show began, sat rapt throughout. I’m afraid I found it harder to engage, and while Brodsky’s imagery is often darkly brilliant, a sense of torpor set in eventually.

But revelations about Mr. Bostick, starting with his name, suggest a different reason for the cameras’ presence: Maybe he was watching watching for the day when his past would catch up with him. That past took shape at a house party 26 years ago and about 170 miles away, in Worcester, Worcester, Mass. On Aug. 26,1990, Anibal Vargas, 39, one of about 30 people at the party, got into a fight, pulled out a gun and fired it, wounding a rival and accidentally accidentally hitting someone else in the leg, the police said. The victims survived. Mr. Vargas fled. He bought a new birth certificate certificate and a Social Security card, according to a criminal complaint. complaint. Both were in a new name: Vincent Bostick. He came to New York City and got an apartment on Jerome Avenue under the name Bostick.

For 21 days. Mr. Surmach sucked on a lemon to stave off seasickness seasickness until he reached Ellis Island. There, he told an interviewer decades later, he was shocked to find an American guard welcoming welcoming him to the United States in perfect perfect Ukrainian. Mr. Surmach began his new life in Wilkes-Barre. Pa., but within a few years, he made it back to New York. Eager to preserve his native culture, he opened a small shop on Avenue A in Manhattan where he sold records, books, clothes and other trinkets from the old country country to other Ukrainian immigrants. immigrants. He named the store Surma — after an old woodwindlike instrument instrument — and for 98 years it has operated at various addresses in the East Village, settling in 1943 at II East Seventh Street.

Mr. Cuomo’s signed the executive executive order just before he marched in the Celebrate Israel parade in New York. With the largest population of Jewish residents outside Israel, New York has outsize symbolic, and political, value in the debate over the Middle East. For his part, Mr. Cuomo has shown increased willingness in recent years to get involved in international issues, including a short trip to Israel in 2014 with a state delegation. The B.D.S. movement, started in 2005, has become a contentious issue on some American college campuses and beyond. Supporters say the campaign aims to pressure Israel economically economically over its treatment of Palestinians and to further Palestinian Palestinian independence. Opponents say the efforts are a thinly disguised, disguised, anti-Semitic attempt to deeply hurt or even destroy Israel. Omar Barghouti, a founder of the movement, said he did not find the actions by states like New York surprising, calling such proposals proposals part of Israel’s “legal warfare warfare against B.D.S.” Church and the Ukrainian Museum Museum are among the dwindling number of institutions that invoke the neighborhood’s history. “Inside here, nothing has changed, but outside, everything is different.? said Stephanie Czerepany Czerepany n. 72. who emigrated from Ukraine in 1951 and has worked at Surma since 1978, taking a bus and two trains from her home in Brooklyn.

Because it took so much skill and time to carve. Delicate reliefs spiraling down the length of a 19th-century tusk aren’t just evidence of formal finesse; they’re records of high-pay man-hours. Why did artists combine dissimilar and often unbeautiful materials, as in a bundlelike bundlelike charm made of lizard claws, fibers and beads? Because different things carry different energies, and when difference connects, it ignites, like steel striking stone, new power. Ms. Van Dyke asks a question that all museums showing traditional African art should ask: How did this come to be here? And she answers forthrightly: Some pieces were made as gifts; some were sold by their owners; others were confiscated. A magnificent set of 16thcentury 16thcentury Benin bronze plaques were among thousands of items ripped from shrines and altars by British troops in 1897, then auctioned, and auctioned again. Then, at the end of the show. Ms. Van Dyke lays history aside in a display of Kota reliquary figures that float, like angel-winged astronauts, across a gallery wall. The installation is fantasy ; such sculptures would never have been seen like that. But they make a celestial sight, and celestial is the essence of what these guardians of deceased ancestors ancestors were. The other four segments of “Creative Africa? — which, apart from Ms. Van Dyke, has been organized by the Philadelphia Philadelphia Museum curators Peter Barberie, Barberie, Dilys Blum, H.

It’s a model he’s followed elsewhere in Africa — in the extraordinary Center for Earth Architecture, Architecture, in Mopti, Mali — and more recently in China, Europe and the Middle Middle East, designing public spaces that promote a village-based ethos of cooperation. cooperation. Cultural tides move in many directions, directions, and Africa gets as much as it gives. It got something fabulous when, a century or so ago, a modest Dutch textile manufacturer began sending brilliantly colored and patterned fabrics its way. This story is told in “Vlisco: African Fashion on a Global Stage,” by far the most vivacious of the “Creative Africa” shows. Vlisco is the modern name of the company, which is in the Netherlands and still producing waxprinted waxprinted fabric styles so closely associated with West African and Central Central African fashion that most people assume that they are African-made. Where Africa can lay creative claim to them is at the marketing level. It is in Africa that the Vlisco designs have always been given their identifying names, some cozy, some extravagant: Happy Family. Sword of Kingship. Love Bomb, Ungrateful Husband. Hibiscus, Mercedes Benz. These change from region to region; some are generations old. But whatever they’re called, the patterns are eye-popping, and the museum museum has lined four walls of a gallery with samples of them. It?s a terrific display. And to top it off, a platform in the center of the room is crowded with mannequins dressed in couture made from such fabrics by some of Africa?s top fashion designers: Lanre da Silva Ajayi, l.eonie Amangoua, Amangoua, Pepita Djoffon, Josephine Memel and Ruhinibasa Nyenyezi Seraphine, with Philadelphia’s Ikire Jones throw n in.

I was a little surprised to see these. The museum has no galleries of African art but. it turns out. has been acquiring it for years.

As African art collectors, though, they had nothing on Albert C.

You can see many of them, surrounded by Modigliani Modigliani and Matisse works, at the Barnes Foundation. And these ensembles are reminders that he was a buyer with a social (he would have said educational) mission: He wanted to integrate black artists, African and African-American, into the panorama of world art. He would surely have been pleased to play host to “Nari Ward: Sun Splashed.? a midcareer retrospective of a New York artist who has woven Africa. Africa. via its Caribbean diaspora, into his art. Organized by Diana Nawi of the Perez Art Museum Miami, this isn’t a big show, and it doesn?t include Mr. Ward?s best-known installations, like the 1993 “Amazing Grace.” with its hundreds of abandoned baby carriages, or the 1996 “Happy Smilers: Duty Free Shopping.? with its fire escape. But it?s potent, and right on target for a BlackLives-Matter BlackLives-Matter American moment. Born in Jamaica in 1963. Mr. Ward studied art in New York City in the late 1980s and ?90s, when the market had bottomed out, and artists long excluded — black. Latino, Asian-America — were finding points of entry. Mr. Ward scavenged scavenged the material of his art from the streets of Harlem, and its content from personal experience and history, including including the history of racial politics and popular religion. The two merge in one of the show’s earliest pieces, the 1995 “Iron Heavens,? a kind of altar screen pieced together from black oven pans, against which lean baseball bats, fire-scorched and covered with patchy tufts of cotton. The bats look lethal, though the cotton softens them, as does the churchly setting. They may be weapons, but they are weapons, at least for the moment, laid down. Mr. Ward?s political reflexes are keen but measured, layered. The 2004 installation installation called “Glory,? a tanning bed constructed from oil barrels and designed designed to burn stars and stripes on the skin, is a response to what he views as the xenophobic and mercenary war in Iraq, but one that relates that war to another war, the one he sees waged daily by America on its black citizens. Exploitation is also the message of the 2010 “AfroChase,? a street-found bank advertisement that Mr. Ward has embellished embellished with cowrie shells and Afro picks, turning it into a spiritually charged black-power charm against the gentrification of his Harlem neighborhood. neighborhood. Few 21st-century artists have made stronger and more textured visual statements about racism, failed justice and exile-at-home than this one has. And none have come up with images more poetic. The show’s most recent work, ?Oriented Right,? from 2015, a sheet of patina-stained copper punctured punctured with holes and hung on the wall, looks abstract, storyless, history-free, impersonal. But if you reposition the piece, take it down from the wall and lay it flat, it changes, reveals itself. The patina stains are traces left by the artist’s feet as he walked or danced across the surface. The holes were inspired by some he saw in the floor of the First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Ga., drilled in the 19th century as air holes for hidden fugitive slaves. Mr. Ward has arranged the holes to form African cosmological symbols.

I need to see it empty.” One winter Sunday, Ms. Huberman set out for Brooklyn to look at some co-op apartments. She figured she could meet a co-op?s financial requirements, which tend to be more stringent than those of condos, by purchasing with her father. At a one-bedroom in Crown Heights, she realized how far the neighborhood was from work and friends. With some subway trains out of service that day, the trip was lengthy and confusing. Not far away, on Lincoln Place in Prospect Heights, she saw a charming onebedroom onebedroom for S375.000. w ith a maintenance fee of just under $500 a month. “It was a sunny day and it was so dark and felt sort of depressing,? she said. She moved on; the apartment sold for $.390,000. She found the 1957 Kingsview Homes of good energy in downtown Newark right now.? Some Newark residents worry that the flurry of construction could spell displacement. displacement. particularly in the Ironbound. Six hundred units of housing are approved for construction there, according to Joseph Della Fave. the executive director of the Ironbound Community Corporation. The neighborhood, home to immigrants from countries including Portugal and Brazil, is adjacent to Newark Penn Station and bounded by railroad tracks and the Passaic River. Renters fear rents could rise and home owners worry that the changes could alter the fabric of the diverse community. “Gentrification always has a beginning and the beginning may not be displacement; displacement; it may be part of a market movement,? movement,? said Mr. Della Fave. who was a member member of the Hoboken City Council in the late fifth and i arl fifth when the gentrification gentrification of that citv was in its infancy. “It?s not Fort Greene Another one-bedroom apartment, in a brick building on Ashland Place, lost some points for lack of character. iTHipM.RArnsin iiniiajaiji i/hhuhi niyy York timin complex in Port Greene to be sterile and bland. An available one-bedroom on Ashland Ashland Place, for $389,000 with maintenance of just over $600 a month, was large but not in the best of shape. It sold for $387,000. Ms. Huberman wasn?t interested in any place she saw. The unfamiliar neighborhoods neighborhoods seemed “an uncharted territory to me and that commitment seemed too daunting.? she said. “She wasn’t eager to go far afield in Brooklyn, where you get maybe a larger space.” Ms. Currier said. And she couldn?t meet the requirements of many co-op buildings, buildings, w hich require plenty of liquid assets. But now that Ms. Currier was more familiar familiar with her client?s finances, she thought Ms. Huberman would qualify for a Housing Development Fund Corporation co-op. which comes with income restrictions.

The asking price was S399.000. w ith monthly maintenance of around $300. Ms. Huberman loved it. “Every other apartment I saw. I walked in and I was. ‘Nope, nope, nope.? ? she said. But here was “somewhere I could see myself myself for the duration of living in New York unless 1 get married and have a baby or something.? she said. “For me. one tiny person, person, it was enough.? Her offer of the asking price was accepted. accepted. But the seller then took an all-cash offer of S415.000. The deal was off. Ms. Currier sent Ms. Huberman to another another H.D.F.C. co-op nearby. This one. also on a high floor, had three tiny bedrooms. The asking price was $395,000; maintenance maintenance was nearly $800 a month, including utilities. People were lined up for the open house. “We had to go in in groups of 10,? Ms. Huberman said. “It was insane.? She disliked the building, where “the staircase was single file.? she said. The three bedrooms had been created with makeshift walls. Defeated, she gave up. She assumed she would rent with a roommate. But then, the all-cash offer on the l.-shape studio fell through. This time, the seller accepted accepted her offer, raised to $407,500. Ms. Huberman Huberman arrived in late spring. “It’s great to own,? she said. “It feels kind of adultish and comforting and stabilizing.? Having a future that is ?not fragmented by one-year or 16-month lease renewals is really really appealing to me.? Because she was able to make a large down payment, her monthly outlay is around S 1,200. She far prefers her new neighborhood to the East Village. ?In Williamsburg, none of the buildings are super tall.? she said. “I am not crossing huge avenues all the time.? She also enjoys life without a roommate. “I like not having to tiptoe around anyone else?s design agenda.? said Ms. Huberman, w ho decorated in a contemporary Scandinavian Scandinavian style. The walk up, however, has proved surprisingly surprisingly taxing. She alerts visitors to the climb. “I still feel guilty when people come through my door and they are out of breath.” she said. like one day it’s not here and the next day it?s here.? he said.

Springfield Avenue Marketplace, the University Heights project that houses 24 Jones, was designed to revive the intersection w here South Orange Avenue meets Springfield Avenue. The project sits close to universities universities including Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, and Society Hill, a middle-class enclave enclave of townhouses. But Springfield Avenue Avenue also traverses areas burdened by crime, drugs and poverty. At 24 Jones. 66 of the 152 apartments had rented as of Aug. 17; leasing began in December. December. Many of the tenants are students or faculty at the nearby universities. Rents rival rival those downtown, starting at $1,712 a month for a studio; $1,867 for a one-bedroom one-bedroom and $2,217 for a two-bedroom.

1384,1934707379,"most expensive elevator ride of my life, but the sweeping, cleansing views, miles in every every direction, were worth it. There are many new restaurants dotting the waterfront, further cementing the connection connection between the two parts of the city. MOS, in a starkly modern building jutting out on the I Jdok peninsula, is new but offers somewhat old-school “French-international” “French-international” nouvelle cuisine, along with gorgeous gorgeous water views. I had a fine meal there, but, together with several other new places where I ate, it stirred a feeling that as the city grows and changes so rapidly, it is also in danger of homogenizing. I don’t doubt that the culinary landscape has improved (traditional Dutch fare being, well, you know), but several times it occurred to me that I could have been having the same dinner dinner in Chicago. Ruth Oldenziel made the same point in a different way, telling me that the city government government had taken steps recently toward restricting houseboats on the canals, where the often quirky and makeshift residences have been a feature since just after World War II. “What I worry about,? she said, “is the impulse to take out all irregularities.” How far have the changes gone? One of the pleasures of Noord I remembered was the pastoral quiet once you leave the waterfront. waterfront. During our visit, a local newspaper ran an article decrying the gentrification of Noord, saying in effect that you can’t see the cows anymore for all the BM Ws. One afternoon, my daughter Eva, my son, Anthony, and I cycled out to see if that was true. But 10 minutes after getting off the ferry, we were riding through polders (land reclaimed from the sea). We saw no BM Ws, only lots of farmland. We took a detour on a polder path, then stopped. The wind was the only thing we heard. On the waterways cutting cutting between the fields were herons and rH?)|IH.KAI1IMIY II VY NJIOKIKI III N MW rill Niwvmi IIMI s geese. It was a landscape that could have been painted by Jacob van Ruisdael. II AMSTERDAM’S OUTER REACHES have changed in recent years, so has the city center. center. The complaint we heard from friends who live in the center was about the increase increase in tourists. Statistics bear this out. There were 4.3 million hotel stays in the city in the first four months of 2016, an II percent jump over the same period in 2015, which itself itself was a record high. From the canalsides to central plazas like Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein, Rembrandtplein, the place is packed. But there are positive changes, too. A few years ago many of the major museums were undergoing renovation at the same time, and were either closed or only partly open. All the work has been completed, and these great cultural institutions are now glistening like jewels. The grandest, the Rijksmuseum, the national national repository of Dutch art and history, reopened in 2013, to effusive press. It is staggeringly staggeringly lovely. The redesign accomplished the tricky task of keeping the integrity of its original 19th-century structure while at the same time opening it up. What might have come across, to today?s tastes, as a clunky knight’s castle instead feels stately and inviting. inviting. Like the city, the museum is more popular than ever. The year before it partly closed for renovation in 2003, it had 800,000 visitors; this year it is on track for two million. million. Taco Dibbits, the Rijksmuseum’s new director director (previously the head of collections), sat down with me to discuss the museum and the city. When I asked why both were now so popular, he referred me to the time, circa 2000, when Bill Gates caused a stir by saying he didn?t need to collect art because in a digital age you could have any painting appear on your screen. “Instead,” Mr. DibBelow, DibBelow, from lop: small boats on a canal; a car passes old houses in Amsterdam North; the MYK Film Institute, on the waterfront opposite Central Station, has become a cultural anchor in Amsterdam North. them until now. They are the first life-size portraits Rembrandt completed. At the time, only royalty was deemed worthy of such treatment. Rembrandt was just 28, newly arrived in Amsterdam, and eager to make his mark. By giving this wealthy but untitled couple the royal treatment, treatment, the artist was making a statement about them, about himself and the city. Amsterdam Amsterdam was in the midst of its rise to the status of most powerful city in the world. Its economic engine was powered by people such as the Soolmans and Coppit families: ordinary citizens who had worked their way up to the top. forging great companies whose commerce spanned the globe. The pair of paintings, so alien but so evocative, embody what Amsterdam is all about. Whenever I return to Amsterdam, I make a point of visiting F rieda Menco, who, at age 91, is literally my oldest friend. As a child she lived around the corner from Anne F’rank, and became friends with Anne and her sister, Margot. Like the Franks, her family was rounded up during World War II and sent to a concentration camp. Frieda and her mother met up with Anne and her mother in Auschwitz. The Franks were killed; Frieda and her mother survived. I became friends with Frieda in the process of bits said, “what we’re seeing is that in a virtual virtual world, people want to experience real things.” Mr. Dibbits’s assumption of the directorship directorship in J uly coincided with the return to Amsterdam Amsterdam of a pair of noteworthy former residents. Early this year, the Rijksmuseum and the Louvre jointly purchased Rembrandt’s Rembrandt’s wedding portraits of Marten Soolmans Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit, wealthy 17th-century 17th-century Amsterdammers, for 160 million euros. The museums will take turns displaying them. ( The couple are on view at the Rijksmuseum Rijksmuseum through Oct. 2.) The paintings, which have been given pride of place, next to Rembrandt’s masterpiece masterpiece “The Night Watch,” have been in private private hands since they were painted, and thus few people have had a chance to see interviewing her for my book about Amsterdam’s history. Pamela, Eva, Anthony and I went to her apartment for lunch. Frieda had last seen Anthony when he was a toddler. Now he was 6, and she and I told him some of her story. His reaction unfolded across his face: lie was simultaneously fascinated and alarmed at the idea that war was not something something that only happened in games or on TV. He asked questions; Frieda answered. He was interested in everything, right down to the concentration camp number tattooed on her arm. Only after our lunch with Frieda did it occur occur to me that Anthony was old enough to appreciate the Anne Frank House. Unfortunately, Unfortunately, we hadn’t purchased tickets in advance, advance, and I refused to spend half a day waiting in line. So I took him to one of my favorite smaller attractions, the Dutch Resistance Resistance Museum. It has undergone a renovation, renovation, and the children?s section was so rich — putting you in the shoes of different children when the city was under Nazi occupation, occupation, leading you through a succession of cramped 1940s parlors and bedrooms, a German soldier at the door, a defiant voice over the radio — that after we finished Anthony Anthony wanted to do it all over again. By now our trip had taken on a theme: my son’s absorption with war, the Nazis and the fate of the Jews. A friend told me that a National National Holocaust Museum had recently opened. So Anthony and I went. It is a small place, in a former school where Jewish children children were shielded from the Nazis. The museum museum is still being developed, but the opening opening exhibition — paintings by the Dutch actor actor and artist Jeroen Krabbe — affected both of us. In a series of large canvases, Mr. Krabbe tells the story of his grandfather’s journey from Amsterdam to his death at the Sobibor concentration camp. We studied the paintings, then watched the documentary in which the artist explains explains them, then returned to the paintings. In the center of the exhibition is a scale model of the Sobibor camp. Anthony wanted to understand how it worked, what precisely was the mechanism for a factory of death. And he asked the questions of a 6year-old. 6year-old. “When they took all their clothes off, weren’t they cold?” “Why did they shave their heads?” THE EFFECTS OF BRITAIN’S VOTE ill June to leave the European Union have not shown up yet in Amsterdam. But the topic came up in conversations I had with friends. While people had a range of opinions, nearly everyone everyone thought it would rattle the city. There has been talk of Amsterdam, with its long history as a financial center, eventually replacing London as the unofficial economic economic capital of the European Union. No one I met with looked forward to such a thing. The city has always been modest in size: With 830,000 residents, its population is one-tenth that of London. ?Balance” is what everyone frets over these days, as in how to balance growth and change against tradition and quality of life. This gets at the core of Amsterdam’s identity. It’s not an accident that the city has no central, representative monument: no Big Ben or Notre Dame or Colosseum. The closest Amsterdam has to a defining monument was the one we were staying in. thanks to our friends Kiki and Joost: the canal canal house. An individual family dwelling is an apt symbol for the city because Amsterdam Amsterdam shaped itself around the power and needs of individuals. Where other European European capitals were built around the might of the church or a monarch or both, here the central forces were commerce, art and science. science. All are pursuits spearheaded by individuals. individuals. In the Golden Age, the city’s traders gathered gathered the exotic gomls of the wide world and brought them here, their ships sailing right up the canals to their front doors. They stored those goods — cinammon, nutmeg, pepper — in their attics. The canals were in effect arms extending around the globe, gathering bounty and bringing it not just into the city center but into the very homes of its residents. Dutch interior paintings of the 17th century celebrated the particular brand of domesticity that the Dutch traders fostered. “Gezelligheid” — an untranslatable untranslatable word that means something like “the warm feeling that comes from being secure and in the embrace of friends and family? — is what animates those paintings. Indeed, it still animates Amsterdam. We felt it, on our return to the city that has meant so much to us. And we wondered how long it would endure.",9/4/2016,"('article', 'decrying', 'the')","('noord', 'saying', 'in')","[' During our visit, a local newspaper ran an article decrying the gentrification of Noord, saying in effect that you can’t see the cows anymore for all the BM Ws.']", During our visit a local newspaper ran an article decrying the gentrification of Noord saying in effect that you cant see the cows anymore for all the BM Ws,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After Mass Knife Attack in Japan, Disabled Victims Remain in the Shadows By MOTOKO RICH ZAMA, Japan — A vicious knife attack killed his roommate at a facility for the developmentally disabled in July, but Kazuya Ono does not know that. Mr. Ono, 43, survived slashes to his throat and stomach stomach by the attacker, a former caregiver at the group home, and remains in a hospital nearby. When he is agitated, he scratches himself so vigorously vigorously that he leaves marks on his face and arms. He shouts “blood, blood, blood!” at his nurses. He refuses to eat the hospital food, so his parents, Takashi and Chikiko Ono, bring Ka/.uya?s favorite curry and grapes for lunch. The Onos, who live here in Zama, a suburb of Yokohama, Yokohama, want the world to know more about their cherished son, who is autistic and has the mental capacity of a toddler. toddler. He is one of 26 survivors of the knife attacks that left 19 dead in Saganiihara, a mountain town outside Tokyo. The assailant reportedly told the police that he wanted to “eliminate the disabled from the world.? He may have accomplished that in more ways than he intended. The victims of the worst mass killing in Japan since World War II have also been eliminated from the public imagination. People do not even know their names. Trend Continues With Demise of a Pioneering London Dance Club By DAN Bll.EFSKY LONDON — For fans of one of Ixindon?s most fabled nightclubs, the party is over. This week, the local authorities shut down Fabric, a nightclub that helped put the British capital’s electronic music scene on the global stage and entranced a generation generation of clubbers from all walks of life. The message from officials was clear: The drug-fueled hedonism hedonism would no longer be tolerated. tolerated. The decision by the Borough of Islington to revoke the license of the 2,500-capacity nightclub came after the police had asked the borough borough council to close the venue after after the deaths of two 18-year-olds in recent months. According to the council, both had taken MDMA, a drug better known as Ecstasy. In 2014, the police had also asked the council to review Fabric’s license after the deaths of four others in the previous three years were attributed attributed to drugs. Clubgoers, music critics and D.J.S who made their names at Fabric described the club’s demise demise as a blow for British culture and a threat to London?s place as a global capital of electronic music, for which Fabric was both a laboratory laboratory and a temple. It was also seen as a death knell for nightclubs in London, where venues are already being pushed out by creeping gentrification, the lack of business from some millenninls short on cash, and austerity-conscious austerity-conscious local governments governments that are more favorable to luxury apartment buildings and shopping malls than to loud, raucous raucous music clubs. In August 2015, the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, a group that represents owners of pubs, bars and restaurants, pubChristopher pubChristopher D. Shea contributed reporting. lished figures showing that half of Britain?s nightclubs had shut down since 2005, including dozens in London. The closing of the club reverberated reverberated among revelers around the world; a stop at Fabric was a must-do on any clubber’s trip to Ixindon. Several regulars, who said they viewed Fabric as a second second home, gathered on the steps of the club this week, some overcome overcome by tears. Kevin Ford, a drum and bass producer also known as DJ Hype, wrote on Twitter that he was shaken shaken by the news. “For 15years I was privileged to be part of greatest underground club in the world, I am lost for words right now,? he wrote. Kate Simko, a D..I. and composer composer who was born in Chicago and lives in London, has been playing at Fabric for nearly a decade. decade. She said that the closing was a huge setback for the global electronic electronic music scene and for the local local area’s cosmopolitan spirit. “Fabric is a place where people from all socio-economic backgrounds, backgrounds, colors, and sexual orientations, orientations, tourists and people from finance come together next to edgy club kids in sneakers and mohawks,” she said. “Electronic music is the music of our generation, generation, and I am devastated. Just as clubs in New York have been pushed out of the center and replaced replaced by shopping venues and luxury apartments during the last decade, now this is happening here.” Fabric was one of the last megaclubs megaclubs in central London. Local councils have been cracking down on late-night licenses as the gentrification gentrification of formerly bohemian neighborhoods like Hackney, Dalston Dalston and Shoreditch pushes the counterculture to the outer fringes of the city. Last year, an article in The Guardian lamented “the slow CAM COURT/(iKTTY IMAt.l.s The authorities dosed Fabric this week after the recent drug-related deaths of Iwo 18-year-olds. death of British clubs? and pointed to, among other things, the hysteria of overzealous authorities. authorities. Last year, the Arches, a Glasgow superclub, was closed after after a woman collapsed outside. Fabric’s closing also feeds into the debate about the criminalization criminalization of recreational drug use. There were questions about whether the authorities were making an unfair example of Fabric, Fabric, with the club’s supporters contending contending that those determined to obtain drugs would find a way of using them at the club, with or without tough security checks. The problem of drug abuse has affected venues across the world, including in the United States, where security checks, free water stations, first-aid tents and ambulances ambulances on call have become comabled comabled people say withholding the names is consistent with a culture that considers them lesser beings. Keeping the victims hidden, even after their deaths, these advocates advocates say, tacitly endorses the views of those — including the assailant — who say disabled people should be kept separate from the rest of society. Mr. Ono, who wishes the families would insist on releasing releasing the names, put it bluntly: “I want to create a world in which people are not ashamed of their disabled family members.? let alone the details of their lives. The police in Knna gawa Prefecture have declined to release the identities of the victims, victims, citing the families’ families’ desire for privacy, privacy, in a decision that is increasingly drawing drawing criticism around Japan. monplace at major music festivals. festivals. In its decision to close Fabric, the Islington council said the two teenagers had been able to sneak into the club without the drugs being being detected, and had also bought drugs inside the club. It criticized Fabric for having what it called “grossly inadequate? security. The council said that undercover undercover police operations at the club had revealed patrons displaying symptoms such as “sweating, glazed red eyes and staring into space, and people asking for help.? Fabric said in a statement that it was “extremely disappointed? by the decision, “(.?losing Fabric is not the answer to the drug-related problems clubs like ours are working working to prevent, and sets a troubling troubling precedent for the future of Osamu Nagase, a visiting professor of disability studies studies at Ritsunieikan University in Kyoto, said the public was implicitly approving the attacker’s perception that the victims “didn’t deserve life.? Headded: “If we want to pay respect to those 19 victims, they cannot remain nameless. nameless. They cannot remain faceless.” Such nondisclosure is unusual. In other rare instances instances of mass killings in Japan, like the stabbings of five elderly victims on Awaji Island, south of Kobe, last year, or a knifing attack in 2008 that left seven dead in the Akihabara Akihabara neighborhood of Tokyo, the police identified the victims within days. Indeed, across the globe, the naming of victims is seen as a way to honor them and the losses suffered by their families. As details about individual victims are revealed, revealed, the public is reminded of the humanity that has been brutally taken away. Yet in the case of the Saganiihara killings, the police said the families themselves had requested anonymity, specifically because the victims were disabled. Some, fearful of the stigma, had not even told relatives, friends or co-workers that their sons or daughters resided at Continued on Page AH London?s nighttime economy,? it said. Cameron Leslie, the club’s cofounder, cofounder, told The Guardian this week that since opening 17 years ago. Fabric had adopted a stringent stringent safety approach, handing all confiscated drugs to the police and calling the authorities if anyone anyone was suspected of dealing in narcotics. Hundreds from the music industry industry denounced Fabric’s closing, closing, and a petition to prevent its demise had more than 155,000 signatures signatures by Thursday. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has been pushing to make Ixindon more of a 24-hour city by opening the subway for allnight allnight service on weekends, said he was “disappointed.? Before the club was closed down, Mr. Khan had told the council council that Fabric was important to a nighttime economy in London that contributed 26.3 billion pounds, or about $35 billion, to the city’s coffers every year. “Clubbing needs to be safe, but I’m disappointed that Fabric, Islington Islington Council and the Metropolitan Metropolitan Police were unable to reach agreement on how to address concerns concerns about public safety,? he said in a statement. Mazdak Sanii, chief operating officer of Boiler Room, a platform that streams D.J. sets and dance parties online, said that the consequences consequences of the decision would ripple ripple across the city. “It’s a huge totem on the London London night-life scene, the premiere destination for the world?s biggest D.J.s, and I think the closure is going going to have a totally massive impact impact on the music scene, on dance music culture and on the night-life economy,” he said. “I think it’s got more to do with gentrification, noise complaints and path-of-least-resistance policing policing than it does with public safety. It’s all a bit post-Brexit apocalyptic,” apocalyptic,” he added, referring to Britain?s vote this summer to leave the European Union. Some critics say leaving the bloc will make the country, and its culture, more inward-looking. For many. Fabric was more than just a music venue. Jacob llusley, 35, a promoter and D.J., said in May that his favorite experience experience there came when a Polish couple in their 70s turned up, downed a shot of tequila each, high-fived the D.J. and danced until until 5 a.m. “I took them upstairs to the balcony balcony and brought them some tea — because they wanted to have tea,? he told The Evening Standard.

2947,1934669147,"Indonesians Demand Jail for Christian Official Jakarta’s Governor Is Accused of Blasphemy By JOE COCHRANE JAKARTA, I ndonesia — Tens of thousands of Indonesians marched marched in Jakarta on Friday, demanding demanding that the city?s first Christian governor in decades be jailed for blasphemy. The rally was a show of strength by conservative Islamic Islamic groups, who were offended by his earlier remarks about the Quran and want to weaken him as he runs for re-election. The governor, Basuki Tjahaja Furnama, known as Ahok, is an ethnic Chinese Indonesian and the first Christian in nearly 50 years to govern Jakarta, capital of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority Muslim-majority nation. He has been a political target of some Islamic organizations since taking office in 2014. Some of those groups seized on comments he made in September to a group of fishermen, in which he lightheartedly lightheartedly cited a Quran verse that warns against taking Christians and Jews as friends. His comments circulated on social social media, and hard-liners accused accused him of blasphemy, which is a criminal offense in Indonesia, and pressured the police to investigate. investigate. Mr. Basuki has repeatedly apologized to Muslims who were offended by his remark, but he has rejected calls to withdraw from the election for governor in February, February, which he is heavily favored to win. ‘‘ There was no intention to insult insult religion,? he told reporters this week. “I am sending my message message to all offended Muslims: I sincerely apologize.? Fears of violence at the rally had prompted the closing of some schools and office buildings in central Jakarta, and thousands of police officers and soldiers barricaded barricaded roads as the protesters marched. The American and Australian Embassies had warned their citizens to stay away from the protest zone. There were no reports of arrests arrests or significant violence, Muhammad Rusmadi contributed reporting. ?I Saw My Father Dying’: A View From Aleppo’s Government-Held Side From Page AI Aleppo, was under fire as insurgents insurgents battled government forces on the edge of the city. “My wife and family are hiding in the bathroom,? he said. Even as Syria and Russia threatened an all-out assault on the rebel side of Aleppo, saying Friday was the last chance for people there to exit, they had been unable to put down a counteroffensive counteroffensive by a mix of Qaeda-linked and United States-backed insurgent insurgent groups. Three Qaeda-linked suicide bombers attacked a military position position with explosive-packed personnel personnel carriers on Thursday, military military officials said, and mortar fire was raining on neighborhoods that until now had been relatively safe. It was among the most intense intense rounds in four years of rebel shelling that officials say has killed 11,000 civilians. There was no immediate way to verify their figures, especially since I was stranded inside a government-controlled government-controlled bubble, the only way international journalists can safely report on Syria. Facts have become increasingly increasingly difficult to verify over more than five years of this bloody and chaotic war. Kidnapping threats from extremist factions, as well as government airstrikes, have made insurgent-held areas too dangerous to venture into. And the government tightly controls access to its areas and closely monitors our movements on the rarely approved trips. But one thing is clear: Nearly every Aleppo resident I have talked to in years of covering the war — those still here and those w ho have fled; those who support Mr. Assad, those who oppose him and those in between — knows someone in the government districts districts who has been killed by a random random shell. Aleppo, one of the world?s oldest continuously inhabited cities, has an estimated 1.5 million residents on the government side, including thousands who have fled from the east, where the United Nations says about 275,000 are trapped by government forces, suffering shortages of food and water along with indiscriminate bombing. This is my first visit since 2001, when I wandered around the bustling old souks, which date from medieval times; visited the ancient citadel that towers at Aleppo?s heart; and admired the gleaming uniformity of creamcolored creamcolored stone-clad buildings in the wealthier districts that turn pink at sunset. Now, the citadel has been returned returned to its original purpose as a Hwaida Saad contributed reporting reporting though some of the marchers chanted that Mr. Basuki should be killed. Mr. Basuki, 50, the grandson of a tin miner from Guangzhou, China, has been a popular figure in Jakarta. Like his predecessor, Joko Widodo, who is now Indonesia’s president, he is very different from the soft-spoken Javanese Javanese politicians the capital is used to. Brash and blunt-speaking, he is known for publicly berating civil servants as incompetent and corrupt. corrupt. Opinion polls indicate that he holds a large lead over his two opponents in the election for governor governor on Feb. 15. If he wins, he will be the first ethnic Chinese Christian directly elected to the office, the most powerful powerful provincial post in the country country and one that Mr. Joko used as a springboard to the presidency. Mr. Basuki, who had been Mr. Joko?s vice governor, inherited the city?s top job when Mr. Joko became president in 2014. Indonesians practice a pluralistic pluralistic brand of Islam, though pockets of the country are rigidly conservative conservative and there are periodic outbreaks outbreaks of violent radicalism. Political Political opponents have used Mr. Basuki’s religion and his ethnicity against him, but polling indicates that most Jakarta voters do not consider them campaign issues. Analysts said that Friday’s march and other recent protests against Mr. Basuki were, nevertheless, nevertheless, attempts to weaken him ahead of the election. Analysts have also said that some of the Islamic Islamic groups that organized the march have ties to the campaigns of Mr. Basuki?s two opponents, though the groups and the campaigns campaigns have denied that. H is opponents opponents are Anies Baswedan, a former former minister of higher education, and Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, a former Army officer and the son of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who was president from 2004 to 2014. “Precisely because religion and ethnicity are as such not electoral factors, Ahok’s opponents have to up the game,? said Marcus MietA MietA Syrian soldier in Aleppo on Friday. Syria and Russia said Friday was the last chance to escape the rebel-held side before an assault. military stronghold, with government government troops perched behind its crenelated walls. Much of the old market, whose narrow passageways passageways became a hide-out for rebels, lies burned and bombed. I rode in from Damascus with a dozen other journalists on Wednesday. We made the final approach approach to Aleppo through a narrow, narrow, winding government-controlled government-controlled corridor, crawling behind delivery trucks and minivans. The bus wound through earthen berms and collapsed buildings, then through a choke point that has changed hands several times. Shells kicked up dust and smoke in the distance. Then, suddenly, we were in a seemingly functional city. The green buses that have been used to evacuate civilians and rebels from besieged areas were packed with commuters. Taxis knotted up at roundabouts decorated with fountains and newly installed solar solar panels. Residents are far better better off than they were in 2014, when it was rebels who had besieged besieged the government side. But a closer look revealed smal I signs of war: Water distribution centers, with tanks filled by wells to supplement shortages. Generators Generators rumbling on sidewalks, to mitigate power cuts that leave the streets pitch-dark at night. And, a few doors down from our hotel, a IAIAN .NYU l-ANA/ASMX IAII I?

Only the next morning did Seeing progress, but a closer look reveals signs of war. we realize that the eastern face of the hotel was checkered with boarded-up windows from years of shelling. My long absence from Aleppo meant I had missed a whole stage of its development: the restoration restoration and gentrification of parts of the old city, the opening of boutique boutique hotels, the flood of Turkish imports and foreign investment into what was Syria’s industrial and commercial hub. That development push, in the first decade after Mr. Assad took over from his father in 2000, liberalized parts of Syria?s econ“They econ“They know that Ahok is still strong and can easily get into the second round, while the others are far less certain,? he said. “So they think they will be safer if Ahok is defeated, or they hope he will be put in jail and not be able to run.? The police have questioned Mr. Basuki about his September comments, comments, but analysts saw that primarily primarily as an attempt to mollify his Islamist critics. Protesters on Friday, many of whom had arrived in groups from neighboring West Java, chanted, “Hang Ahok, hang the traitor,? and, “Cut off a hand and foot and deport him.? Yet many of the white-clad demonstrators were smiling and taking selfies along the route. Smaller protests, in cities on Java and Sumatra, were also reported to have been peaceful. Mr. Basuki had faced protests because of his Christianity, notably notably before his swearing-in, and he responded with a mixture of good humor and taunts. When omy and energized the tourism industry. industry. But it also disproportionately disproportionately benefited Mr. Assad?s inner circle and the rich, fueling imbalances imbalances of wealth that helped spur the protests in 2011 that led to a security security crackdown and civil war. We had arrived at a critical moment, moment, as Russia said there was only one day left to pass through a corridor it had provided for people to escape eastern Aleppo before the rebel side was flattened, a corridor corridor through which precious few had passed. The government says rebels are preventing civilians from leaving. Rebels refuse any evacuation evacuation without international supervision supervision and a broader deal to deliver deliver humanitarian aid. Instead, they are trying to break the siege, with Qaedalinked Qaedalinked groups and those backed by the United States working together together — the opposite of what Russia has demanded. So anxiety was running high on both sides of Aleppo, with people in the west fleeing shelling and people in the east fearing airstrikes airstrikes more devastating than any they had faced. This visit has been even more tightly orchestrated than usual. Journalists are always required to move around with a governmentapproved governmentapproved minder. This time, a dozen dozen uniformed soldiers and several Islamists threatened two years ago to storm his offices at City Hall, he assured them that they would be arrested if they did so. Though Chinese-Indonesians make up just over 1 percent of Indonesia?s population, they have tended to wield economic clout beyond beyond their numbers, which has often often led to resentment. For decades, they were subjected to discriminatory laws and regulations, regulations, and more than a thousand people were killed in anti-Chinese rioting in 1998, mostly in Jakarta, amid protests against President Suharto?s authoritarian rule. Mr. Basuki has been lauded for expanding populist programs in Jakarta started by Mr. Joko. He has fast-tracked infrastructure projects, including a mass-transit system; dispatched a small army of orange-clad street sweepers to spruce up the city of more than 10 million; and instituted a “smart card? program to subsidize health care and education for the poor. His main re-election slogan is the Ministry of Information employees have kept us to a tight schedule of planned stops, and refused refused to let us even walk briefly around the streets without an escort. escort. On Thursday morning, we passed rows of small kiosks selling selling cigarettes, snacks and other goods. Some kiosks were painted with the Syrian flag; a few were roofed with tarps from the United Nations refugee agency. Families of fallen soldiers and merchants displaced from the old market are granted permits to operate the kiosks as a kind of compensation from a cash-strapped government. government. A group of factory owners met us at the chamber of commerce, where a picture of President Recep Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is used as a doormat. They blame him for backing rebel groups that looted factories and sent their machinery machinery to Turkey. We toured the Layramoon industrial industrial district, recaptured from rebels over the summer. Buildings lay pancaked by airstrikes, and stripped of their marble cladding and copper wiring by looters. Soldiers Soldiers led us down a crumbling staircase to windowless underground underground rooms that they said had been used as prisons by a rebel group called Division 16. Next stop was a part of the old Indonesian word for work, “Kerja!” Ixtst year, Mr. Basuki threatened to buck I ndonesia?s political political system by running as an independent, independent, after a grass-roots volunteer volunteer organization collected more than a million signatures in a petition drive enabling him to do so. But in the end, he stayed with Mr. Joko?s governing Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the largest political party in the country. country. Supporters of Mr. Basuki expressed expressed confidence on Friday that the show of outrage over his remarks remarks would not hurt his chances in February. “We?re not worried about the protests,” said Richard Saerang, a leader the grass-roots organization organization Teman Ahok, or “Friends of Ahok.? “We believe our criminal justice system will handle the case fairly — he did nothing wrong,” Mr. Saerang said. “ I t?s just a matter of perspective.” souk recaptured early in the war, now plastered with posters of Mr. Assad, his father and Hassan Nasrallah, Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Shiite Lebanese militia that has provided crucial assistance to government forces. We climbed over piles of rubble to reach the Mameluke-era Khan al-Wazir, its vaulted ceilings and cubbylike shops burned and blackened with soot. We peered over a barricade at the walls of the citadel and the pile of rubble that was once the Carlton Hotel, destroyed destroyed by rebels with a massive tunnel bomb. “Moderate rebels” was a sarcastic sarcastic refrain we heard often, making fun of the Obama administration’s administration’s description of groups it backs; the Syrian government calls them terrorists. At Al Razi hospital, where Ahmed Ahmed Noor Battal, the newly orphaned orphaned 14-year-old, was weeping, we arrived to panic and chaos. One woman wailed and collapsed in the arms of a nurse, who struggled struggled to keep his bloodstained hands off the back of her white sweater. “Don?t tell me he died! Don’t!” she shrieked. “I only have this one son.” “He will survive,? the nurse said, but his eyes said something different. Minutes later, the son, Hazem Sherif, 26, a doctor, lay dead on a stretcher. Outside, I tidal Shehadeh sat slumped on the sidewalk near the morgue, whimpering. Her husband, husband, Mohammad Ayman Shehadeh, Shehadeh, a security guard at the transportation department, had been hit by a shell while parking his car. “I saw my father dying from the balcony,? said his son Adel, 13, crying crying and trembling. “ I saw the mortar mortar landing and smoke coming from my father?s car.” Another relative shouted at the soldiers, demanding that the army take tougher action. He had been displaced by rebels three times, he said, adding, “It?s time to end it.? But the next morning, the corridors corridors set aside for people to leave eastern Aleppo were empty and silent. Soldiers there said they did not expect the evacuation deal to work. “It should be finished by bombing,? bombing,? one said. At one crossing point, Syrian soldiers, and a few Russians, waited at a checkpoint decorated with posters of Mr. Assad. Judges stood by to determine whether evacuees were wanted by security security forces. Tw?o shells landed, one less than 100 meters away. Soldiers blamed rebels trying to stop the evacuation; evacuation; rebel groups denied it. At any rate, the crossing was closed.

Fans of the food say part of its appeal is that it is infinitely customizable. “It’s not supposed to be a gourmet item,” said Anthony Ramirez II, a Bronx entrepreneur who ow ns a restaurant and bar, the Bronx Beer Hall, and the company company FromTheBronx.com. Mr. Ramirez said the sandwich was popular with students he used to work with. “You don?t go out of your way looking for it,” he said. “It’s an affordable option, and it’s hot and tasty.? But in recent years, the sandwich sandwich has been finding a w ider audience: audience: a cameo in a Bronxthemed Bronxthemed episode of Anthony Bourdain?s Bourdain?s CNN show, “Parts Unknown”; Unknown”; a shout-out in a restaurant restaurant review in The New York Times; an in-depth look on a food blog run by Complex Media; and a growing volume of web features, music videos and social media chatter. Whatever it was, the chopped cheese?s star was on the rise. The Almonte Episode The video that helped set off a backlash was made by Insider, an online publication, about a reporter?s trip to Hajji?s to try a chopped cheese. To many online commenters, the video suggested a kind of imperiousness. imperiousness. Of the sandwich, the reporter, who is white, said that ?most NewYorkers NewYorkers don?t even know it exists,? a slight, it seemed, to many New r Yorkers who grew up eating it. It was complimented in a backhanded backhanded way as ?nothing revolutionary revolutionary but still delicious.? And it did not help that the reporter called the bread a “sub roll,? not a hero, as it is commonly called in New York, revealing herself to be an outsider. But perhaps it was the description of the S4 sandw ich as “a steal” that incensed the most.

His video was streamed millions millions of times, part of a steep spike in internet searches for the sandwich. sandwich. The chopped cheese?s fame continued to grow, for better or worse. Emotional Debate Heated discussions about cultural cultural appropriation are not, of course, limited to food. The borrowing borrowing of certain styles of dress, music, dance and language has long prompted similar debates. “This is a classic story,” said Michael Michael W. Twitty, a culinary historian. historian. “You create something in a state of want, a state of necessity, and then it becomes prime real estate estate in someone else?s hands.” But debates about food, with its deep connection to taste and all of its potential implications about class bias, can take on a particularly particularly emotional tenor. The other day, the upscale department store Neiman Marcus, set off a social media storm by offering three pounds of collard greens — a Southern staple long associated with African-Americans — for S66. And for foods popular among minorities, there is a history of grotesque stereotypes used as marketing, Mr. Twitty said.

Mr. Twitty said. ?Are the sources being acknowledged and respected?? White Gold Jocelyn Guest, a 32-year-old butcher, said that when she and her business partner, Erika Nakamura, Nakamura, decided to open up a butcher shop and restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan featuring classic New York fare, they had to include the chopped cheese. “It’s such a huge part of the New York sandwich canon,? Ms. Guest said, w ho was introduced to it when she lived in Harlem. But news that the restaurant.

Jeffrey Almonte, a YouTube personality from Harlem, challenged the tone of a video report by Insider. “This is a free market,? Mr. Moslih said. “When people want a nice pastrami, they’ll go to Katz?s. And if people want a nice chopped cheese, they’ll come here.” The sandwich continues to work its way into the city’s culture in unexpected ways, showing up in vegan renditions, in recipes and at a recent food festival. A scroll through the web turns up a video of a w hite standup comedian. Will Carey, performing a bit about the sandwich. ?Just knowing what a chopped cheese is. I?m destroying a vital multicultural part of New York City,? he jokes. It is the subject subject of a few memes, including one that riffs on the gentrification of the sandwich. It has popped up as far away as London, at a bar that recently added added one to its food menu. At Insider, the reaction to its “sub roll? video prompted some sober reflection. ?I think we all came to the conclusion that they were right,? said Stephen Parkhurst, a supervising producer. ?We could have approached approached it with a little more sensitivity.” sensitivity.” Mr. Parkhurst said the video team had since adjusted its approach approach to ensure that ideas were vetted by a diverse group to better filter those that could be “insensitive “insensitive or imperialistic.? Mr. Almonte, who had harshly responded to that video, was more measured in a later interview. “For the past few years now. I?ve been seeing this whole thing with the hood being romanticized or trendy,” he said. “People who don?t live here want to talk like us, dress like us, act like us, but don?t know the struggle of actually living here.?

CHARLES ISHERWOOD THEATER REVIEW Even before you enter the auditorium at St. Ann’s Warehouse Warehouse to see Penny Arcade’s solo show “Longing Lasts Longer,” the voice of the performer can be heard echoing through the lobby as she wanders the aisles engaging with the audience. I overheard a funny aria about her trials with the health care system even before I took my seat. Ms. Arcade, whose delivery suggests what might have happened happened if Phyllis Diller had fallen in with the Andy Warhol crowd (as indeed Ms. Arcade did), trains her stiletto wit on the gentrification of New York in this entertaining if rambling show. The city, she laments, was once a place of renewal, where creative people came to invent themselves anew, shedding the skins of conformity. conformity. “We were inspired and intoxicated intoxicated by the palpable sense of freedom in the streets,? she recalls, recalls, having herself fled a Connecticut Connecticut factory town. ?Now,” she continues, ?people come to New York and they want New York to be like where they?re from, the suburbs.? What’s worse, they no longer see the city as a beacon of possibility, except narrowly. “They don?t feel the need to reinvent reinvent themselves. They just think that they need to become successful and make a lot of money.? Sing it, Penny. True, this particular tune has been played before. Ms. Arcade, who created the show with her longtime collaborator, Steve Zehentner, is hardly the first to note that many of the gritty streets of the city have become sleek alleyways lined by expensive expensive boutiques, chain stores and more Citibank branches than an entire continent should need.

And Ms. Arcade soon departs from her central theme to head into broader territory, tracing the spread of mass culture and its toxins back to the 1920s, to Edward Edward Bernays, sometimes called the “father of public relations.” She quotes him saying, “If we If Chelsea Manning Sat and Chatted With President Obama The line between personal and public is both blurred and paramount paramount in “Private Manning Goes to Washington,? a new show inspired by the self-proclaimed whistle-blower Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning) and the activist hacker Aaron Swartz.

She goes on to cite evidence that, well, yes, too many of us have become a great mass succumbing succumbing to shiny objects. (She, on the other hand, boasts that she has never owned a Barbie kitchen before theatergoers make their way to the performance performance space, which has a lived-in feeling because, well, it’s someone?s someone?s basement. There is even a functioning bathroom that enjoys some action during the show, as audience members unlucky enough to sit on the left side of the house will discover. “Private Manning Goes to Washington” Washington” continues through Monday Monday at the Studio at 345,345 West 13th Street, Manhattan: thereprescntatives.org. Trains of Thought Waiting to Connect in Levittown From First Arts Page a byword for cookie-cutter uniformity. uniformity. (The title refers to the Long Island Rail Road line that goes there.) The year is 1967, part of a decade in which such conformism was under siege. Aaron, who needs the work, commutes from Manhattan to conduct an adult education class consisting of six Levittowners, suspended in this promising cultural collision of time and place. (Richard Hoover?s set, David Weiner?s lighting and Sarah Holden?s costumes capture this anxious moment with style.) The students are embodied by a mouthwatering cast, directed a bit fuzzily by Terry Kinney. They include the Tony winners Frank Wood, as a war veteran with an active dream life, and Randy Graff, as the domineering leader of a tribe of gossipy, like-minded housewives. Her chums are portrayed with nasal glee by Maddie Corman and Julie Halston. Michael Oberholtzer Oberholtzer is a socially challenged former class valedictorian who repeats the word “Hi? like a robot. And you can thank heaven that Elizabeth Reaser also shows up, late for class, as a beautiful agoraphobe who talks in the unstrung poetic manner of a Tennessee Williams heroine. So many potential writers, so many tales to be told. Aaron is of course the story-teller-in-chief, and it his wry and rueful recollections recollections of that season in Levittown Levittown that frame the proceedings. But Mr. Greenberg allows all his characters their moments in the authorial spotlight, with narratives narratives that inevitably become more and more self-revealing. The class misfit and default star is Joan Dellamond (Ms. Reaser). who spins dreamlike yarns of suburban malaise that bring to mind John Cheever in a fantastical vein. The difference is that Joan is (improbably) telling the truth, and what she writes and recites links up in unexpected unexpected ways to the lives of the other students, especially to the smitten smitten hut frozen Aaron. “ The Babvlon Line? would doll, been to Disneyland or seen “Jaws”) Naturally, she’s not too pleased about the recent election. ?The only relief is that it gave us a break from the Kardashians and Taylor Swift,? she cracks, although although a direct line could be drawn from the vacuous celebrity celebrity culture exemplified by the rise The immersive aspect of Stan Richardson?s play fits both the Representatives company motto of “radically intimate theater? and the subject: what happens when secrets are exposed to the outside world.

But I digress, as does Ms. Arcade, moving from a brief history of the advertising industry industry to carping about tourist hordes invading the city. She is often blistering — much of the show is essentially a free-form rant — but her anger is always circulate freely. He first put that belief in action when, as a kid, he stole his friend Billy?s journal. Years later, Aaron, now an influential influential Mountain Dew-swilling tech dude, tries to persuade Billy (E. James Ford) to collaborate on a play to publicize the imprisoned imprisoned Ms. Manning?s plight. Their goal is for their show to become a meme: “If the combo?s right, empathy will go viral,? Aaron explains, clearly unfamiliar unfamiliar with the reach of any theater work that is not “Hamilton.” Billy and Aaron then rehearse people are to one another, he also tends to tie up his eventful and sprawling plots with a desperate, last-minute neatness.

Don?t get her started on the proliferation of cupcake shops, the cultural obsession with youth or, especially, how coddled college college students are walled off from anything that might possibly alarm them. A few too many of the complaints complaints feel recycled, and none are likely to ruffle the feathers of anyone in her audience. The loss of the idealism horn in the 1960s is a familiar story, although Ms. Arcade specifically stresses that she has no nostalgia for any decade. Her motto could be: ?Been everywhere, done everything, everything, time to move on.? Still, it was only when Ms. Arcade shifted into uplift mode that my interest began to flag. “Happiness is a decision you make. Happiness is not magic,” she says toward the show?s close. “I don?t need anyone to make me happy, and neither do you! I am already happy. I need other people to share my happiness with!” Thanks for sharing, Ms. Arcade. Arcade. But the truth is this singular singular performer is really better at strafing our unsatisfactory world with rage than at pushing selfempowerment. selfempowerment. I loved her most when she was freely hating, then stopping to add, ?Nobody here has to worry, because, you see, I already hate so many people, I can’t hate anyone new until 2022 .? I wouldn?t bet on that particular particular prophecy coming true, and frankly I wouldn’t want it to. the play-within-the-play, which is titled ?Private Manning Goes to Washington? and imagines a meeting between Ms. Manning, the former Army analyst, and President Obama. Those scenes meander, lacking dialectical fire between the fictionalized pair. Aaron is the most interesting character here, but Mr. Richardson Richardson fails to dramatize what drove — and tormented — him. (The real Mr. Swartz committed suicide in 2013.) We’ll just have to wait longer for a good show about an internet savant. memorably seductive neurotic, usually female and full of meat for actresses like Ms. Lavin, Patricia Clarkson and Jessica Hecht. Joan Dellamond is his latest contribution to that gallery, and Ms. Reaser fills out the portrait portrait with vivid strokes. Her Joan is an extroverted introvert, or perhaps vice versa, with the curled and slightly hunched posture of someone trying to disappear by folding inward and drawing all the more attention in the process. Yet though she at first registers as terminally shy and hesitant, it soon becomes clear that she already possesses an assured and original sensibility. By the end, Mr. Greenberg has generously allowed all his characters, characters, even the bad-faithstymied bad-faithstymied Aaron, to discover their voices. “The Babylon Line? remains remains stranded in the search for Do not forget the Neediest! is his students,",12/6/2016,"('wit', 'on', 'the')","('new', 'york', 'in')","[' Arcade did), trains her stiletto wit on the gentrification of New York in this entertaining if rambling show.']", Arcade did trains her stiletto wit on the gentrification of New York in this entertaining if rambling show,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donald J. Trump, won the presidential election. But her mood of celebration quickly faded when students held an evening vigil on campus — to mourn the results — and her biology teacher suspended class on the assumption, Ms. Delekta said, that students would be too upset to focus. She was outraged. ? Nobody has died,? Ms. Delekta said. “The United States has not died. Democracy is more alive than ever. Simply put, the American people voted and Trump won.” She circulated an online petition and accused the university president of catering catering to the liberal majority by suggesting suggesting that “their ideology was superior to the ideology of their peers,? as she put it, when he sent out an email publicizing the vigil and listing counseling resources for students upset by the election. Three days later, she was invited to meet with the president in his office. “I was completely shocked that he even read the letter? she said. “That was definitely a new thing.

Congress. In Washington, the infighting has begun. And potentially most alarming for the party about to be out of power, there is a paucity of younger Democrats ready to run for office: Hillary Clinton is 69. Senator Bemie Sanders, her main opponent opponent in the Democratic presidential primary, is 75. The answer for Democrats may be to look West. California Democrats (and to a lesser extent. Republicans) are in the midst of a generational renewal, as some of the old lions of the party — Gov. Jerry Brown, 78; Senator Barbara Boxer, 76; Senator Dianne Feinstein, 83; and Representative Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority minority leader, who is 76 — approach the end of their public careers. And there is no shortage of rising Democratic figures ready to take the reins in California. This new class of Democratic leaders seems likely to reshape the political face of California for a generation. But for national national Democrats, they also represent a potential talent pool of leaders who can help pull the party out of the worst crisis it has faced since 2005, the last time the Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. California also stands ready to become a laboratory for Democratic policy that, it seems fair to say, will have little chance for enactment enactment in Washington, at least for the next two years.

This election delivered the party two-thirds control of both houses of the Legislature, in addition to control of all statewide elected officials. And Democrats Democrats here stand in stark contrast in terms of ideology and demographics to President-elect Donald .1. Trump and his followers. That has been particularly clear this week in Sacramento, where the Democratic Democratic leaders of the Assembly and Senate Senate — Kevin de Leon, the president of the Senate, and Anthony Rendon, the leader of the Assembly — introduced legislation intended to thwart any effort by Mr. Trump to crack down on immigration. ?Californians may accept the lawfulness lawfulness of the November election, but milllOKX.RAPIUs milllOKX.RAPIUs liY BRITIANY I.RIBOX IOR III!

Cities are calling on neighbors to report report buildings they suspect might be giving giving parties like the one that took place the night of the fire at an Oakland warehouse warehouse known as the Ghost Ship, while concert promoters report a broad crackdown crackdown on illegal spaces around the country. country. “I knew there would be this wave, but it happened a lot faster than I thought,? said Forest Juziuk, a Detroit-based booker for electronic musicians like those who played at the warehouse where the fire occurred. ?By Tuesday night I started seeing text messages from around the U.S. about fire marshals coming through and eviction notices being being served.? In the days since the fire, there have been reports of event spaces being scrutinized scrutinized or shut dow n in cities like Nashville, Nashville, Philadelphia, Dallas, Austin, Indianapolis, Indianapolis, New Haven and Dubuque. The question now is whether the tragic fire in Oakland will become a national turning point that forces these spaces out of business, business, or if it will push them deeper into the shadows. Over the past few decades, many of America?s once-gritty cities have seen a profound revitalization in which decaying decaying industrial buildings have been turned into residences, artists? lofts and gallery spaces. These buildings often serve as sources of affordable housing and profit, while providing walls and stages for an underground circuit of artists artists and musicians. “You have spaces that are not being used in a particular area, and urban entrepreneurship entrepreneurship fills the space,” said Edward Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies cities. “It?s something we love about cities, but it?s a constant battle between between urban creativity and the attempt of regulators to impose controls on it.? The warehouses in Oakland are similar similar to ones nationwide that struggle with this dynamic.

Both the Fire and Housing Departments investigated the building and found numerous safety and housing violations. ?The Housing Department condemned condemned the building and boarded it up,? Mr. Clark said. No city officials are going to say they approve of illegal parties held in decrepit warehouses, but some acknow ledge privately privately that underground spaces are part of how cities work and are likely to remain remain so. In the aftermath of the Oakland fire. Mayor James Kenney of Philadelphia and the commissioner of the Department of Licenses and Inspections sent out a joint news release calling on warehouse owners and managers to make sure their spaces are safe. The city’s Office of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy said in a statement statement that it “understands that artists are resourceful in identifying spaces that meet their distinct, creative needs.? adding, adding, “our priority remains their and the public’s safety.? “We are concerned about exactly what happened in Oakland,? said Karen Guss, a spokeswoman for the Licenses and Inspections Inspections Department, but “there is no way this city or any city of size is going to be able to address these issues on their own.?

He found his calling in the business business world when he and his wife opened the first Little Caesars, in Garden City, a Detroit suburb, in 1959.

He was 97. His death was confirmed by Deborah Smullyan, a cousin. Professor Smullyan was a serious serious mathematician, with the publications and the doctorate to prove it. But his greatest legacy may be the devilishly clever logic puzzles that he devised, presenting presenting them in numerous books or just in casual conversation. Sometimes they were one-offs, and sometimes they were embedded embedded in longer narratives to explain mathematical concepts, such as Boolean logic, as he did in ?The Magic Garden of George B and Other Logic Puzzles? in 2015; or retrograde analysis, as he explored explored in the “The Chess Mysteries Mysteries of the Arabian Knights? in 1981. He was also a character. With his long white hair and beard. Professor Professor Smullyan resembled Ian McKellen?s wizard. Gandalf, from the “ Lord of the Rings? film series.

And audiences audiences grew 1 . All the while, Mr. Lichtenstein hardly seemed to pause to draw breath, and those who dealt with him knew he was a man with a mission. His ebullient managerial style could also become blunt and abrasive.

There were some missteps, including including Mr. Lichtenstein’s unsuccessful unsuccessful attempt to set up a repertory repertory theater company in the early 1980s headed by the British director director David Jones. But there were plenty of highlights as well, among them Peter Brook?s imaginative imaginative staging of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream?; Philip Glass’s “Satyagraha,? an opera about Mahatma Mahatma Gandhi?s youth in South Africa; Africa; “The Gospel at Colonus,” a freewheeling adaptation by Lee Breuer and Bob Telson of a work by the Greek tragedian Sophocles; Sophocles; another Glass opera, “Einstein “Einstein on the Beach?; and Mr. Brook?s monumental 1987 staging of “The Mahabharata,? a ninehour ninehour dramatic voyage through turned around franchises that experienced experienced many lean years.

When they began planning for ?The Mahabharata,? Mr. Lichtenstein Lichtenstein and Mr. Brook agreed that the Opera House was too large for the production, which had first been staged at Theatre des Bouffes du Nord, Mr. Brook’s more intimate Parisian theater. The problem was solved when Mr. Lichtenstein suggested they take a look at the Majestic, an abandoned theater built in 1904 and later used as a movie house, on nearby Fulton Street. There they climbed a ladder, entered through a window and found what they decided was the perfect performance performance space, surrounded by an ocean of decay. After a S5 million renovation — w ith most of the funds supplied by the city — the Majestic was deemed ready and was renamed the BAM Majestic Theater. Seating Seating was reduced to just under 900 from a little more than 1,700, and although there had been some patching and painting, there was no effort to fully modernize.

Reminiscing about it, he wrote that it was a ?pretty sneaky way of winning a kiss, wasn?t it?” Jason Rosenhouse, a mathematics mathematics professor at James Madison Madison University, who edited a book in 2015 celebrating Mr. Smullyan, said the clarity of his puzzles could unveil the beauty of math to those who could not previously grasp it. “It was like fooling a kid into eating his vegetables,? Professor Rosenhouse said in a telephone interview, interview, adding. ?Raymond took something like Godel’s incompleteness incompleteness theorems and used a string of logic puzzles as a device for presenting them.? Martin Gardner, himself a renowned renowned math puzzler, compared Professor Smullyan to the Oxford logician Charles Dodgson, who also was an author better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll. Professor Smullyan paid tribute to Carroll in his 1982 book ?Alice in Puzzle-Land: A Carrollian Tale for Children Under Eighty.? In one chapter.

Manhattan. He was 87. His son John confirmed his death. He said Mr. Lichtenstein had a stroke about seven years ago, and had been in declining health for the past few months. When Mr. Lichtenstein arrived at the academy in 1967, its stately building on Lafayette Avenue, erected in 1908, needed extensive and costly renovation. Portions of it had been rented out, and there had even been talk of tearing down the building and using the site for tennis courts. Many members members of Mr. Lichtenstein?s target audience, especially Manhattanites, Manhattanites, viewed the neighborhood — the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn Brooklyn — as undesirable. “ 1 1 was a risky business, and we often landed in the soup,” Mr. Lichtenstein wrote in a reminiscence reminiscence in The New York Times in 1998, after he had announced his retirement as the president and executive director. “For all the excitement, excitement, audiences and money were hard to come by.” Even so, Mr. Lichtenstein was determined to open the Brooklyn Academy, also known as BAM, to all that was new and exciting, and he wasted no time getting to work. The 1967-68 season, Mr. Lichtenstein?s Lichtenstein?s first, included Alban Berg’s atonal opera “Lulu?; performances by a number of modem dance troupes — Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham and Alwin Nikolais, among others; others; and the Living Theater’s evening of political protest, ?Paradise ?Paradise Now.?

The academy, which was founded in 1861 and calls itself America?s oldest continuously operating operating performing arts center, gained a reputation as the place to find new and provocative work, be it dance, drama or music. And audiences audiences grew. All the while, Mr. Lichtenstein hardly seemed to pause to draw breath, and those who dealt with him knew he was a man with a mission. His ebullient managerial style could also become blunt and abrasive. John Rockwell, the first director of the Lincoln Center Festival Festival and a longtime critic and editor editor at The Times, characterized that style in a 1998 Times article as a mixture of “the inspirationally collegial and the petulantly dictatorial.? dictatorial.? Even so, he added. ?People complain but, with a few exceptions, exceptions, they keep working with him.” There were some missteps, including including Mr. Lichtenstein?s unsuccessful unsuccessful attempt to set up a repertory repertory theater company in the early 1980s led by the British director David Jones.

Of the evening?s performance, performance, however, he continued: “Mr. Jarreau?s concert lacked the emotional range of great jazz. He is such a prodigious talent that the absence of even the slightest blues inflections kept his music from cutting deeply.” But critics? reservations never deterred Mr. Jarreau, who prided himself, as he told The Los Angeles Angeles Times in 1986, on his “jazz attitude,? attitude,? which he defined as “the idea of being open to each and every every moment as a chance to create something different.” “I try to be receptive,? he added, added, “and to be listening, and to not be afraid to try something new.” Alwin Lopez Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940, into a musical family.

320,1926737049,"Dr. George Weinberg wrote a book that rejected the prevalent idea that homosexuality was a psychological disorder. George Weinberg, 87; Studied Homosexuality By WILLIAM GRIMES George Weinberg, a psychotherapist psychotherapist who, in the mid-1960s, observed the discomfort that some of his colleagues exhibited around gay men and women and invented a word to describe it — homophobia — died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 87. His wife, Dianne Rowe, said the cause was cancer. Dr. Weinberg was preparing to speak before the East Coast Homophile Homophile Organization in 1965 when he began thinking about a recent incident. A group of colleagues, colleagues, learning that a friend he was bringing to a party was a lesbian, lesbian, asked that he disinvite her. He sensed not just dislike, he said, but also fear — a fear so extreme that it suggested some of the characteristics characteristics of a phobia. “I coined the word homophobia to mean it was a phobia about homosexuals,? homosexuals,? Dr. Weinberg told Gregory M. Herek, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, in 1998. “It was a fear of homosexuals which seemed to be associated with a fear of contagion, a fear of reducing reducing the things one fought for — home and family. It was a religious fear, and it had led to great brutality, brutality, as fear always does.” Dr. Weinberg discussed his ideas with the gay activists Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke, who used the new term in a column they wrote for Screw magazine on May 5, 1969, discussing the fear felt by straight men that they might be gay. It was the word’s first appearance in print. A few months later. Time magazine magazine used ?homophobia? in a cover article, “The Homosexual in America.? Dr. Weinberg used it for the first time in print in “Words for the New Culture,? an article in the newsweekly Gay in 1971, and discussed discussed the phenomenon at length in his book “Society and the Healthy Homosexual,” published in 1972. The invention of the term was “a milestone,? Dr. Herek wrote in the journal Sexuality Research ? Social Policy in 2004. “It crystallized the experiences of rejection, rejection, hostility and invisibility that homosexual men and women in mid-20th-century North America America had experienced throughout their lives. “The term stood a central assumption assumption of heterosexual society on its head,? he continued, “by locating locating the ‘problem’ of homosexuality homosexuality not in homosexual people, but in heterosexuals who were intolerant intolerant of gay men and lesbians.? George Henry Weinberg was born on May 17, 1929, in Manhattan, Manhattan, where he grew up in Washington Washington Heights. His father, Frederick, was a lawyer who left the family when his son was just a few months old. George did not see him again until he was 18.

He attended City College, where his skill at poker and billiards billiards helped defray his living expenses, expenses, and earned a master?s degree degree in English from New York University in 1951, writing a thesis on Samuel Johnson. He remained a passionate Shakespearean, mining mining the plays for psychological insights insights that led to two books, “Shakespeare on Love? (1991) and “Will Power! Using Shakespeare’s Shakespeare’s Insights to Transform Your Life” (1996), written with Ms. Rowe, his sole survivor. He studied mathematics and statistics at the Courant Institute, a part of New York University — he would later write a textbook, “Statistics: An Intuitive Approach? Approach? (1974), and a mathematical mathematical fable, “Numberland” (1987) — but found that he enjoyed talking to people about their problems and trying to solve them. He left math behind and earned a doctorate in clinical psychology from Columbia, writing his dissertation dissertation on clinical versus statistical prediction in psychology. Dr. Weinberg wrote several books aimed at the general reader. He dealt with personality formation formation in “The Action Approach: How Your Personality Developed and How You Can Change It” (1969) and “Self Creation? (1978); with obsessive behavior in “Invisible “Invisible Masters: Compulsions and the Fear That Drives Them?

He was best known, however, for “Society and the Healthy Homosexual,?

Dr. Weinberg, a staunch and very public advocate of gay rights, helped lead the campaign that led the American Psychiatric Association Association to remove homosexuality from the second edition of its Diagnostic Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a handbook of psychological disorders. “ I felt like an apostle of the obvious, obvious, and people imagined I was doing something daring,? he told Gay Today in 2002. Over time, “homophobia? evolved from a rallying cry to a contested term. Critics, both gay and heterosexual, argued that however useful the word might be as a political tool, or as a consciousness consciousness raiser, it did not withstand withstand scrutiny. Homophobia, they pointed out, was not precisely equivalent to an irrational fear of snakes or heights, and the emotions emotions associated with it were more likely to be anger or disgust than fear. Its meaning had become too diffuse, they argued, covering everything everything from physical assault to private thoughts to government policies. In 1992, The Associated Press, in a revision of its stylebook, discouraged discouraged use of the word.? Phobia means irrational, uncontrollable fear, often a form of mental illness,” illness,” David Minthorn, The A.P.’s deputy standards editor, wrote in a column. “In terms like homophobia, homophobia, it’s often speculation. The reasons reasons for anti-gay feelings or actions actions may not be apparent. Specifics Specifics are better than vague characterizations characterizations of a person’s general feelings about something.? Dr. Weinberg remained unconvinced. unconvinced. The phenomenon still existed, existed, he asserted, and only one word did it justice. “As long as homophobia exists, as long as gay people suffer from homophobic acts, the word will remain remain crucial to our humanity,? he wrote in The Huffington Post. “ Indeed, Indeed, the next big step should be to add ‘homophobia’ to the official list of mental disorders — not to cleanse the language of it.?

Mr. Van de Kamp was subsequently subsequently elected twice to the pothe pothe East Asian Institute, a master’s master’s from the School of International International Affairs and a doctorate. Over the years, he held a number of visiting professorships. In China, he taught at Fudan University, University, the People’s University of China and the City University of Hong Kong; in the United States, at the University of California, in both lx?s Angeles and Berkeley, and at Columbia, Yale, Oberlin College and Princeton. Professor Kwong became an expert expert on the history of Chinese immigration immigration to the United States since the mid-19th century and its evolution. “Chinatowns used to be ghettos because of segregation,? he told NPR this month. “After the 1965 Immigration Act, you have a resurfacing resurfacing of Chinatowns all throughout the United States, and particularly in the East Coast.” In the half-century since then, he said, immigrants scattered as jobs became less concentrated. Few enclaves proved as durable as Chinatown in Lower Manhattan. Manhattan. “If you define Chinatown as a place where people work, live and socialize, then it will most likely disappear,? he said in 2009. “ Many factories have closed down, and lower-income residents have less reason to live in Chinatown.” He added, “Like many other old immigrant communities, the space will still be there, but the essence will be gone.? Although more Chinese immigrants immigrants now live in Brooklyn and Queens, Chinatown in Manhattan has endured longer, in part, he said in the NPR interview, because because it joined adjacent neighborhoods neighborhoods to resist gentrification. “We are basically the very last stand,” he said. sition; during his first term, he was on the short list to become director director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Investigation, a job that went to William H. Webster. Mr. Van de Kamp’s signature achievement in two terms as attorney attorney general was setting up a computerized fingerprinting system. system. But he was also known for his vigorous antitrust enforcement and efforts at environmental and consumer protection. On the day he brought the AK-47 to the State Assembly, in February 1989, Mr. Van de Kamp held the rifle to his chest and told legislators that he could kill them all in the time it took to utter a sentence. sentence. “You are lucky that I am the attorney attorney general and not a nut,” he told them. He is survived by his wife, the former Andrea Fisher, and a daughter, Diana Van de Kamp. After losing the campaign for governor in 1990, Mr. Van de Kamp entered private practice. He also served as president of the Thoroughbred Thoroughbred Owners of California, which allowed him to indulge his love of horse racing, and as chairman chairman of his family’s l^awry’s Restaurants chain.

1553,1985331136,"The dwindling industrial heritage along with the burgeoning arts scene are only the latest version of the city?s Janus-faced character. owners of Fiat. Standing in front of Giacomo Balia’s Balia’s “Velocita astratta,” 1913, with its Futurist waves of pommeling speed, there is a certain melancholy in being able to look out onto Lingotto’s Lingotto’s rooftop, still paved with the curving asphalt where Fiat used to test its cars. The dwindling industrial heritage along with the burgeoning arts scene are only the latest version version of the city’s Janus-faced character. In 2006, Turin and its region played host to the Winter Olympics, providing an excuse to clean streets and revamp the city’s image. Over aperitive and snacks at a bar in one of the city’s porticoes, Carlo Carlo Capello, an anthropologist at the University of Turin studying unemployment in former Fiat neighborhoods, told me that, since the Olympics, a general discourse of a “changing city” had come into being, centered around the arts. This language had settled in, despite the persistence of real poverty: Twelve percent of the city’s residents residents and 40 percent of its youth were unemployed, unemployed, the highest level in northern Italy. “The center of the city has seen a lot of investment,” Capello said. “It’s insulated from the periphery.” In 2016, the peripheries had their revenge in the form of a political earthquake: The ruling center-left Democratic Party was defeated by Chiara Appendino, a young candidate from the populist Five Star Movement. She had run a campaign campaign emphasizing a city “divided in two,” as she noted in an advertisement. “On one side are the lines in front of the museums,” she said. “On the other, the lines in front of soup kitchens.” The growing divide between the art-focused and industry-focused cities may be irreconcilable. irreconcilable. But in the gap, new institutions have emerged that take advantage of both.

I spoke to Troiano and her co-founder, Renato Leotta, outside of the nondescript building, building, as they prepared for a panel discussion they were hosting on the new philosophical current current of “speculative realism.” When I asked them about the possibility of their contributing to the gentrification of the depressed neighborhood, neighborhood, Leotta bristled. “I’m quite critical of the idea, we’re not interested in that,” he told me. Instead, they found more value in the actually open-ended artist residencies, where the artists benefit from the local manufacturing expertise. Around us, in active warehouses, workers were moving around on forklifts. That had always been the hope of the arts in Turin: its uneasy and never stable amalgam of aristocratic connoisseurship, bourgeois finance and working-class know-how. The question is whether, under its current conditions, it might be resurrected, on a more egalitarian basis. I chatted with Cripta747’s two current artists in residence, Sebastiano Impellizzeri and Corinna Gosmaro, both of whom were attracted to the city’s cheapness and the sheer number of artists. artists. It allowed for a “stimulating exchange with others,” Gosmaro said. Impellizzeri, a painter who had moved from Sicily, waved a cigarette in the darkening air, and lauded the beautiful light of the place, which gave it “a real atmosphere for painting,” he said. As he spoke, I had to dodge a forklift that was trundling toward toward me. I thought of Nietzsche’s line — “I would have never thought that the light could make a city so beautiful” — which he wrote only some weeks before losing his mind.

Below, a “For Lease” sign on the street. in the Village: Bleecker Street Blues New Tune PHOTOGRAPHS BY CHRIS MOTTALINI FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES CONTINUED FROM PAGE D1 Bleecker. Joining those brands, at various points, were Comptoir des Cotonniers (345 Bleecker Street), Brooks Brothers Black Fleece (351), MM6 by Maison Margiela (363), Juicy Couture (368), Mulberry (387) and Lulu Guinness (394). Today, every one of those clothing and accessories accessories shops is closed. Indeed, over the past year, Mr. Sietsema, the senior critic at Eater NY, has watched with mild schadenfreude but greater alarm as his neighborhood has undergone yet another another transformation from a famed retail corridor whose commercial rents and exclusivity exclusivity rivaled Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif., to a street that “looks like a Rust Belt city,” with all these empty storefronts, as a friend of Mr. Sietsema’s put it to him recently. recently. In the heart of the former shoppers’ paradise paradise — the five-block stretch running from Christopher Street to Bank Street — more than a dozen retail spaces sit empty. Where textured-leather totes and cashmere scarves once beckoned to passers-by, the windows are now covered with brown construction construction paper, with “For Lease” signs and directives to “Please visit us at our other locations.” locations.” “There’s graffiti, trash inside,” Mr. Sietsema Sietsema said. “It’s horrible.” Of the Marc Jacobs mini-empire on Bleecker Street, the only survivor is Bookmarc, Bookmarc, at 400 Bleecker, which sells art books along with items like $80 smartphone cases. This used to be the site of the Biography Bookshop, where bookworms crowded into one another as they reached for volumes by James Boswell or Robert Caro on the overstuffed overstuffed shelves. If many of the high-end stores along Bleecker didn’t prosper as businesses, “they succeeded in transforming the area into a luxury retail neighborhood that feeds on itself,” said Jeremiah Moss, who has tracked the city’s ever-changing streetscape on his blog, Jeremiah’s Vanishing Vanishing New York, since 2007. Bleecker Street, Mr. Moss said, is a prime example of high-rent blight, a symptom of late-stage gentrification. “These stores open as billboards for the brand,” he said. “Then they leave because the rents become untenable. Landlords hold out. And you’re left with storefronts that will sit vacant for a year, two years, three years.” How Bleecker went from quintessential Greenwich Village street, with shops like Condomania and Rebel Rebel Records, to a destination for Black Card-wielding 1percenters, 1percenters, to its current iteration as a luxury luxury blightscape is a classic New York story. It involves a visionary businessman, a hit HBO show, an Afghan immigrant, a star architect, architect, European tourists, aggressive landlords landlords and, above all, the relentless commercial commercial churn of Manhattan. And it began with gourmet cupcakes. IN 1987, AFTER learning about a store for rent from the owner of a Bleecker Street nail salon, salon, Arleen Bowman opened a women’s clothing boutique under her own name at 353 Bleecker, between West 10th and Perry Streets. The space was around 300 square feet; she paid $1,500 in monthly rent. “It was a time when everybody wanted stuff with fringe on it,” Ms. Bowman recalled. recalled. “And I was like the queen of fringe.” Her neighbors included antiques stores like Pierre Deux, Treasure ? Trifles and Susan Susan Parrish; a pet store called the Bird Jungle; Jungle; the Biography Bookshop; and Nusraty Afghan Imports, where an immigrant named Abdul Nusraty had been selling rugs, jewelry and antiquities since 1979. “Each store was unique,” Ms. Bowman said. “Susan Parrish — she had the best vintage vintage quilts and linens ever. It took me a halfhour halfhour to walk home because I stopped and chatted with everybody.” After five years, Ms. Bowman moved to a slightly larger storefront next door, signing a 10-year lease for $2,500 a month, but all around her not much else changed throughout throughout the 1990s. The tourist crowds, proliferation proliferation of fashion chains and sharply escalating escalating rents in SoHo felt far removed from west Bleecker, with its tiny shops and close-knit vibe. Ms. Bowman and her neighbors hardly noticed when, in 1996, Magnolia Bakery opened at 401 Bleecker, where the bird store had been. It was just another local business, like the bodega operated by Turks or the Greek diner Manatus. But on July 9, 2000, Magnolia was featured featured on “Sex and the City,” in Season 3. The 30 seconds of Carrie Bradshaw and her friend Miranda eating cupcakes outside the bakery were all it took to turn the street. Soon, Magnolia was written up in British Vogue, and what Mr. Sietsema described as a “cupcake bouncer” was stationed on Bleecker to corral the tourist hordes who THE NEW YORK TIMES waited in lines that bottlenecked the block. The Magnolia crowd in part convinced Robert Duffy, then the president and vice chairman of Marc Jacobs, that the company should open a store nearby. When a space became available on Bleecker and 11th Streets, Mr. Duffy, who lived in the neighborhood neighborhood and dined regularly at the Paris Commune, outbid five other prospective tenants. As Mr. Duffy told The New York Times back in December 2001, “If I could have 20 stores on Bleecker Street, I would.” Like many people, Ms. Bowman believes the arrival of the first Marc Jacobs store, with its trendsetting clothes and clientele of fashion editors and celebrities like Sofia Coppola, was the tipping point. “Once Marc opened up, all the dolls wanted to be on Bleecker Street,” Ms. Bowman said. Lulu Guinness, the British handbag designer, designer, flew to New York to secure retail space in what had been an incense emporium. emporium. Fresh, the cosmetics brand owned by LVMH, took over a former beauty parlor. Ralph Lauren opened a men’s shop in 2003, a women’s store in 2004 and a Double RL outpost in 2005. Intermix, Cynthia Rowley, James Perse, Brunello Cucinelli, Coach, Mulberry, Tommy Hiifiger, Robert Marc, Olive and Bette’s, Jimmy Choo, Burberry, Gant and Nars all followed. If that sounds like too many fashion brands to squeeze into a five-block stretch, consider that landlords converted groundfloor groundfloor apartments into storefronts to meet the demand for space. The gentrification of the meatpacking district, where Jeffrey New York opened in 1999, spilled into the far West Village, turning turning the area into a shopping and dining playground. When Richard Meier’s first glass residential towers on Perry Street were completed, in 2002, it hastened the continuing change of the Village from Joe Gould’s scruffy bohemia to a prestige address address for bankers and movie stars. It was around this time that Janet Russo, a clothing designer, and her husband, Bill Jacklin, an artist, both longtime Village residents, sold their townhouse on Bank Street to Mr. Duffy. She felt the Village had changed, she said, “to the point where I wouldn’t want to live there.” But, she added, she didn’t foresee the effects effects on Bleecker Street, where she used to scour the antiques stores for inspiration and household items like curtains. “I’m not so sure Marc and Robert knew, either, that what they started was this crazy thing,” said Ms. Russo, who lives in Connecticut Connecticut with her husband. “I don’t think anybody really anticipated what happened.” happened.” If some of the residents had trouble adjusting, adjusting, everything was great for the landlords landlords and the luxury brands, at least for a while. Busloads of potential shoppers were deposited on the street during “Sex and the City” fan tours. Each Christmas, Santa Claus made an appearance at the Marc by Marc Jacobs boutique, posing for Polaroids with the well-groomed children of these new Villagers. Who knew whom you might spot shopping shopping on Bleecker Street — Sofia or Scarlett or Mary-Kate and Ashley? Or even Carrie Bradshaw herself, since the actress Sarah Jessica Parker lived in the neighborhood. Bleecker Street, said Faith Hope Consolo, the chairwoman of the retail group for the real estate firm Douglas Elliman, “had a real European panache. People associated it with something special, something different.” different.” Ms. Consolo, who has negotiated several several deals on the street, added: “We had visitors visitors from all over that said, ‘We’ve got to get to Bleecker Street.’ It became a mustsee, mustsee, a must-go.” Early on, Ms. Consolo said, rents on the street were around $75 per square foot. By the mid-to-late 2000s, they had risen to $300. Those rates were unaffordable for many shop owners like Mr. Nusraty, who was forced out in 2008 when, he said, his lease was up and his monthly rent skyrocketed skyrocketed to $45,000, from $7,000. Brooks Brothers Brothers Black Fleece took over his space at the corner of Bleecker and Christopher Streets. Other exiled businesses included Toons Thai restaurant, Leo Design and the beloved beloved Biography Bookshop, which secured a new space east of Seventh Avenue and renamed renamed itself Bookbook. By 2012, only a few old-timers remained, including Ms. Bowman, who, through a lucky break, had renewed her 10-year lease in 2002, just before the street took off. But when she called her landlord to renegotiate, his quote — $35,000 a month — all but ended the discussion. She closed, too. “My space was taken over by the Organic Pharmacy,” she said. “It has nothing to do with being a pharmacist. They sell high-end creams, and they give facials.” And then? Blowback. While quirky independent independent stores couldn’t afford the new Bleecker, it became apparent over time that neither could the corporate brands that had remade the street. An open secret among retailers had it that Bleecker Street was a fancy Potemkin village, empty of customers. Celebrities shopped there because because they wouldn’t be bothered. The “Sex and the City” fans lining up at Magnolia and snapping photos of Carrie’s stoop weren’t willing or able to fork over $2,000 for designer designer heels. “Jimmy Choo — I never saw anybody in the shop,” Ms. Bowman said. “I don’t get it. Above, the interior of 306 Bleecker Street. Below, 363 Bleecker Street, formerly a Maison Margiela store. Abdul Nusraty, who owns Nusraty Afghan Imports, was forced to move his store to Christopher Street because of a rent increase. An area that turned into ‘a luxury retail neighborhood that feeds on itself.’ Who s buying this stuff? Robert Burke, the founder of a namesake luxury consulting firm, said Bleecker Street was “a vanity location — meaning it’s more about the image than about retail sales or foot traffic.” At a time when shoppers are buying online online and fashion brands across the industry are hurting, “the challenging business environment environment makes it less interesting to do vanity vanity locations,” Mr. Burke said. Especially when the cost to operate them keeps rising, with landlords on Bleecker Street demanding demanding as much as $800 per square foot in recent recent years, according to Ms. Consolo. “What happened in the last year is the retailers retailers started to push back,” she said. “They weren’t getting the foot traffic. They stopped renewing, and the vacancies started to roll.” NOW THAT MANY of the big fashion brands have pulled out, what will become of the west end of Bleecker Street? Is it possible for shop owners like Ms. Bowman and Mr. Nusraty, who is practically waiting in the wings around the corner on Christopher Street, to lease affordable space there again? It’s unlikely. As indicated by the languishing languishing storefronts, landlords are willing to hold out. Ms. Consolo, the real estate agent, noted the number of newish beauty boutiques on Bleecker, including Sisley and Aesop, as well as long-term tenants like the perfumer Bond No. 9 and the beauty brand Fresh. The future of the street, she said, may be as “beauty and lipstick alley.” Other companies have swooped in to fill some of the vacant storefronts, opening pop-up shops, signing short-term leases or risking a longer stay. Many are foreign brands looking to raise their profile in America, like Orla Kiely, an Irish designer, and Enfold, a Japanese line that opened on the street last fall. Elad Yifrach, the founder and creative director director of L’Objet, an upscale decor brand that opened its first New York store last fall in one of the former Coach outposts, believes believes the area still has retail magic, despite the recent hard times. “Bleecker is quintessential West Village,” he said. “The most beautiful townhouses are around there. The street needs to go back to bringing a cool factor, things that will inspire the audience.” For many longtime Village residents, what the streetis missing is not a cool factor but the essential mix of businesses that makes a neighborhood function. On a recent afternoon, Marjorie Reitman, who has lived in the Village for 43 years and who was out on Bleecker Street walking her neighbor’s dog, Walter, reflected on the street’s mercantile mercantile past. “I remember when I first moved down here,” she said. “There was a hardware store owned by an elderly couple, a grocery store, a newspaper store.” She was standing in front of ATM Anthony Anthony Thomas Melillo, a clothing boutique that opened in February to sell $115 “destroyed wash” T-shirts and other garments. The store had no customers, and the front door was open, allowing the air-conditioning to pump out into the street, something Ms. Reitman Reitman lectured the young sales associates about. “That’s the attitude: T have money, I can pay the fine, I don’t care,”’ Ms. Reitman said. The original Marc Jacobs store on Bleecker that started the boom was next door with its windows blacked out. Ms. Reitman Reitman had an idea for that space and the other empty stores that dot Bleecker Street like missing teeth in a very expensive mouth. “They should all be pot shops,” she said. “Seriously.

1681,1985332612,"LOSING GROUND There Goes the Gayborhood As some communities gentrify theres angst over a loss of identity. BRYAN MELTZ FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES The Castro in San Francisco, one of the nation’s most expensive districts. By SCOTT JAMES SAN FRANCISCO — The artist John Criscitello of Seattle first became angry a few years ago about the changes in his beloved neighborhood, neighborhood, Capitol Hill, historically the city’s enclave for gay men and lesbians. The area had become decidedly more straight and, in his view, infuriatingly obnoxious. “On Friday and Saturday nights, it’s like Mardi Gras,” Mr. Criscitello said. He called the area “a puke-and-leave drinking destination” destination” for the city’s young heterosexuals, who seemingly have little regard for, and some hostility toward, the gay people who have lived there since the 1960s. So Mr. Criscitello responded with art, creating creating a series of provocative and sometimes vulgar street murals excoriated the invading invading masses as homophobic and insensitive. “I wanted to poke a stick at the beehive of what was going on,” he said. Similar culture clashes are playing out across the nation in historically gay districts, districts, nicknamed gayborhoods. Places like Greenwich Village in Manhattan and the Castro district in San Francisco, once incubators incubators for the gay rights movement, have “straightened” in recent decades, leading to incidents of resistance and some angst about the effects on the L.G.B.T.Q. community. community. The changes are due in large part to the increased expense that comes with the rising rising popularity and gentrification of many inner cities. But growing acceptance, legally legally and societally, of the L.G.B.T.Q. comMISHA comMISHA FRIEDMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES The West Village, which has undergone “straightening” recently. munity is also responsible. Less discrimination discrimination means more options of where to live, and many residents, especially millennials, no longer believe they must huddle among their own kind to survive and thrive. Not long ago, gay men and lesbians had to create their own communities for safety and opportunity. Many of America’s gayborhoods emerged during World War II, according to Amin Ghaziani, associate professor at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and author of the new book “Sex Cultures.” The United States military’s strict prohibitions prohibitions against gay men and lesbians meant that anyone even suspected of homosexuality homosexuality was discharged, most often in cities with major military bases, such as San Francisco, Francisco, New York City, Seattle, Miami and New Orleans. “The concentration of young gay men and lesbians in urban centers altered their cultural imagination,” Mr. Ghaziani wrote. “Bars that catered to them opened in larger numbers, and, over time, the first formal gay neighborhoods, or gayborhoods as we now call them, emerged.” As news of these neighborhoods spread, they became magnets. It was a phenomenon phenomenon called the Great Gay Migration, a phrase coined by the anthropologist Kath Weston. Cleve Jones, the longtime gay civil rights activist and creator of the AIDS quilt, was part of this diaspora, moving to San Francisco Francisco from Arizona in 1973. He found relative safety, acceptance and a diversity that had been forged by America’s open enmity toward toward gay men and lesbians. “When I came to San Francisco, all of us, regardless of skin color, or ethnicity, or economic economic status or gender, we were all criminals criminals — in the eyes of the law, we were all unapprehended felons,” Mr. Jones said in an interview. “In many cities it was illegal for us to even gather. That outlaw status broke down many of the barriers that exist in the larger society.” These initial gayborhoods offered the first opportunities for many to interact openly with people of the same sexual orientation. orientation. The concentration of gay men and lesbians also created political clout, Mr. Jones said. Such a dense community could be rallied: In San Francisco, it helped elect Harvey Milk to the city’s Board of Supervisors in 1977. He had the highest profile among openly gay candidates at the time, and his election was a watershed in the national struggle for gay rights. The seeds sown back then have led to greater tolerance and new rights, including marriage equality. Acceptance also means a growing number of heterosexuals have no qualms about sharing a neighborhood with gay men and lesbians. But the main force driving the changes in the nation’s gayborhoods is economic. The first L.G.B.T.Q. outposts were often in marginal or neglected urban areas that allowed people who were considered outcasts outcasts to find homes and start businesses with relatively little opposition or capital. (Even today, gay men and lesbians earn less than heterosexuals, according to national national surveys.) As gayborhoods, these communities improved and flourished, eventually becoming affluent and desirable places to live. The Castro, in San Francisco, for example, example, had been somewhat abandoned by a working class exodus to the suburbs, creating creating an opening in the 1970 s for gay and lesbian lesbian residents. Today the area is one of the most expensive residential districts in the nation. The average single-family home there sells for more than $2 million, according according to a 2016 report compiled by the Paragon Real Estate Group, which studies the neighborhood. neighborhood. Market-rate two-bedroom apartments apartments rent for about $4,400 a month, according according to Rent Jungle, a company that tracks rents. “Cities are changing in a very profound and new way,” Mr. Jones said, “with the rich claiming the inner cities.” In Seattle, nearly every city neighborhood neighborhood had an increased concentration of gay and lesbian residents from 2000 to 2012, except except for the Capitol Hill gayborhood, which saw a 23 percent decrease. Mr. Criscitello said gay residents there were priced out and outnumbered as thousands thousands of new housing units were built in response response to the booming local tech economy. New residents tend to be “heavily straight and heavily male,” Mr. Criscitello said, and able to pay higher rents. “It would be naive for us to presume that gay neighborhoods were somehow protected protected from the tides of change that affect all other neighborhoods in all other cities,” Mr. Ghaziani said in an interview. “They’re not.” But as many longtime gayborhoods change, others are emerging or growing. Mr. Jones said Palm Springs, Calif., had transformed in recent decades into a popular popular retirement community with housing less expensive than in San Francisco. In Chicago’s Boystown, gentrification has replaced some gay-centric retail stores with more mainstream offerings. But in the neighborhood of Andersonville, a few miles north, the number of gay bars and businesses businesses has increased in recent years. And just outside the city, the Village of Oak Park has become a destination for same-sex couples couples with children, a type of gayborhood few would have imagined in years past. Efforts are also being made in places not well known for tolerance of gay men and lesbians. The group LGBT Detroit has established established a new community center in the city’s Murray Hill neighborhood. “We’re in the business of changing some hearts and minds,” said Curtis Lipscomb, the group’s executive director, noting that people should not have to run off to San Francisco or New York City to be gay. “You shouldn’t leave family to be free,” he said. In Providence, R.I., a section of the city’s downtown is strewed with rainbow banners on utility poles, advertising its gayborhood of bars and cafes. Plans are also in the works for an L.G.B.T.Q. community center. “There’s a very large craving to have a space where you can meet like-minded people,” people,” said Davide Gnoato, board president of Rhode Island Pride. Mr. Ghaziani referred to these new efforts efforts as “cultural archipelagos.” He warned that gay men and lesbians still face discrimination. discrimination. But, he said, “Plurality is the name of the new game,” as shown by newly emerging gayborhoods. Still, some worry that much could be lost as the old famed gayborhoods become watered-down watered-down versions of their former selves. Political clout, services and opportunities could be diminished. “This is not about nostalgia,” Mr. Jones said. He bemoaned a lack of thoughtful conversation conversation about the issue. “The gayborhoods are going away,” he said. “Where do we go now? The old ways of organizing and defending defending ourselves are being changed. What are the new strategies?” And those raising concerns are struggling struggling to be heard. In Seattle’s Capitol Hill, there are few remaining neglected buildings buildings for Mr. Criscitello’s protest murals, and when they do go up, “they’re taken down immediately,” he said. PRESERVING HISTORY PHOTOGRAPHS BY SASHA MASLOV FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES The Story Before Stonewall New Yorks L.G.B.T.Q. saga began well before the bars 1969 battle. By LIAM STACK The Stonewall Inn is perhaps the best-known gay historical site in the United States. Riots that erupted there at the end of June 1969 — when patrons fought back against a police raid — are widely hailed as the catalyst for the modern modern movement for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. Last year, President Barack Obama designated the bar and an adjoining park as a National Historic Historic Monument. But L.G.B.T.Q. history in New York City goes back much further. For the last several years, the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project has worked to map the city’s role in that history, which “is really not known that well, and it is really hard to document,” said Ken Lustbader, Lustbader, the co-director of the organization. organization. There were only two historical sites out of the roughly 92,000 on the National Register of Historic Places when the NYC LGBT project began in 2014, Mr. Lustbader Lustbader said. His group received a grant from the National Park Service Service to add five more gay and transgender transgender sites to the register. So far, three have been added: the Greenwich Greenwich Village gay bar Julius’, the Chelsea home of civil rights leader Bayard Rustin and the Staten Island home of the photographer Alice Austen. “L.G.B.T. history is American history, and the contributions of L.G.B.T. Americans to the wider culture have been huge,” he said. “If you took them away I don’t know what America would look like.” Below are some of the sites in the NYC LGBT project: Julius’ A “sip in” protest at this bar in 1966 by the Mattachine Society, one of the country’s first gay rights groups, helped end a state policy that revoked the liquor licenses of bars that served known or suspected suspected gay people. Greenwich Village Waterfront The waterfront at the end of Christopher Christopher Street has been an important important gathering place for L.G.B.T.Q. people for over a century: a place where they could socialize, look for love and politically organize. Bayard Rustin House Rustin, an African-American civil rights leader, lived in Chelsea from 1963 until his death in 1987. From this apartment he helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and worked to integrate New York’s schools. THE NEW YORK TIMES Clockwise from top: the straight-friendly Starlite Lounge gay bar, Jacob Riis Park, the Bum Bum Bar in Queens and Earl Hall on the Columbia campus. Lesbian Herstory Archives This volunteer-based museum and community center was founded in Manhattan in 1974 and moved to Brooklyn in 1993. It houses one of the world’s largest collections of lesbian history, including 11,000 books dating to the 19 th century. Alice Austen House Austen, a late 19th- and early 20thcentury 20thcentury photographer who captured captured images of New York’s lesbian communities, lived at this Staten Island house with her partner of 53 years, Gertrude Tate. Today it is a museum. Langston Hughes Residence Langston Hughes, a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, wrote several books while living in this Harlem rowhouse from 1947 to 1967, including “Montage of a Dream Deferred” and “I Wonder as I Wander,” his second autobiography. autobiography. Student Homophile League at Columbia University Students at Columbia University founded the country’s first gay student organization in 1966 and held meetings and social events in Earl Hall. A formal gay lounge was established in Furnald Hall in 1971. The Starlite Lounge Harold Harris, an openly gay African-American businessman also known as Mackie, opened this straight-friendly gay bar in 1962, a time when the Mafia controlled gay night life. It was a pillar of the black L.G.B.T.Q. community until it closed in 2010. Christine Jorgensen Childhood Residence Christine Jorgensen became one of the most famous people in the world when she had gender reassignment reassignment surgery in Denmark in 1952. Reporters swarmed her home in the Bronx, where she had lived since 1926, when she returned returned to the United States. Franklin E. Kameny Childhood Residence Franklin E. Kameny, whose activism activism helped lead to the end of a federal ban on gay employees and the end of the medical classification classification of homosexuality as a mental illness, lived here from 1925 to 1948. He helped popularize the slogan “Gay is good.” Bum Bum Bar This bar has been a social center for a mostly Latina lesbian community community since it opened in the early 1990s. Today it is one of only four lesbian bars in New York City. Riis Beach The eastern end of the beach at Jacob Riis Park has been a popular site for L.G.B.T.Q. sunbathing and socializing since the 1940s. At times it has affectionately been called “Screech Beach.” It has long been one of the most popular gay beaches in New York. Transy House This house was a transgender collective from 1995 to 2008.

He had the highest profile among   openly gay candidates at the time and his election was watershed in the national struggle for gay rights The seeds sown back then have led to greater tolerance and new rights including marriage equality Acceptance also means growing number of heterosexuals have no qualms about sharing neighborhood with gay men and lesbians But the main force driving the changes in the nation s is economic The first outposts were often in marginal or neglected urban areas that allowed people who were considered out casts to find homes and start businesses with relatively

Area residents want the section between Fifth and Sixth Avenues named for the rock legend Jimi Hendrix. Bringing the Groove Back to the Block Recognition Sought for the Old Village Haunts of Jimi Hendrix By COREY KILGANNON The party was getting into groovy gear in the backyard of 50 West Eighth Street in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. Village. Inside a cottage apartment tucked behind behind this residential building, revelers could almost kiss the sky through the solarium’s solarium’s sunroof. The revelry in the garden garden had a psychedelic “Apocalypse Now” theme, with partygoers dancing to Jimi Hendrix’s “Voodoo Chile” among bamboo stalks and tiki torches illuminating illuminating a tall shrinelike stone from Bali. Then the host, Rob Key, an internet entrepreneur entrepreneur who lives in the rental cottage, cottage, turned down the Hendrix and explained explained that the point of this party, on a recent weeknight, was to gather support to get the block of Eighth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues named after Hendrix, who is believed to have lived in the cottage toward the end of his life. “Before he died, he built his studio on the other side of this wall,” said Mr. Key, referring to Electric Lady Studios next door, which Hendrix opened just before his death in 1970. “You guys can feel it in the air, right? Music doesn’t just disappear — it sticks around for a while,” Mr. Key told the gathering of local residents, merchants and artists, urging them to sign a petition supporting the effort. He introduced Storm Ritter, an artist who cuts a striking figure on the block in her loud retro outfits, outfits, and who last year opened Storm Ritter Ritter Studio, which sells original clothing and artwork, including hand-painted items. Mr. Key and Ms. Ritter both made the point that Hendrix embodies the rebellious rebellious and creative spirit that once made Eighth Street the hippest block in the Village. Village. That spirit, they lamented, is sorely in need of bolstering today, as the block’s counterculture vibe has withered in the face of gentrification and rising rents. Electric Lady Studios has survived and there are still some scrappy, independent independent stores like the longtime Uncle Sam Army/Navy. There is Ms. Ritter’s funky boutique, which optimistically displays displays a mock “Hendrix Way” street sign over the entrance. But the block’s hodgepodge of businesses businesses — upscale restaurants and fastfood fastfood places, massage and nail salons, coffee shops, not to mention the handful of vacant storefronts - lack a cohesive spirit that Hendrix espoused, Ms. Ritter said. Richard Geist, who opened Uncle Sam’s in 1998, said there was little on the block to attract tourists. “Gentrification is killing us,” he said. “Eighth Street has lost the magic and we want to bring that magic back, and bring traffic back to help business.” Renaming the block after Hendrix would honor the musician and might help rekindle some of the creativity and self-expression the block once had, Ms. Ritter said, adding that it could also have the commercial benefit of attracting visitors visitors and shoppers whose numbers have declined greatly. “We all want the street to be cooler,” she said. This stretch of Eighth Street was once part of the Village’s main crosstown commercial thoroughfare and an epicenter for counterculture and creativity. creativity. In 1931, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney established the Whitney Museum of American Art on the block, and even before before that, the block’s Bohemian vibe was A party at the cottage where Mr. Hendrix may have lived. Rob Key, the current occupant, says he has collected 1,000 signatures on a street-naming petition. sewn by actors like Lillian Gish and John Barrymore who lived in the Hotel Marlton, Marlton, an affordable single-room occupancy occupancy hotel that later housed many other prominent actors, as well as the comedian comedian Lenny Bruce during his widely publicized publicized six-month trial for obscenity in 1964. By the 1950 s, the block was lined with cabarets, including the Bon Soir, which helped give Barbra Streisand her start. There was the Eighth Street Bookshop, a favorite of the Beat writers and poets, including including Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Ginsberg. But the block’s counterculture character character had begun to fade by the 1970s and gave way to crime in the 80s. The Marlton Marlton became a college dorm. In the 1990s, national retailers like Kmart and Genovese Genovese drugs arrived. Today, even the crowds of young people people who came for the head shops, T-shirt emporiums and glam-trashy-fashion boutiques have waned. The Marlton is A mixing board at Electric Lady Studios, which Mr. Hendrix opened on West Eighth Street shortly before he died in 1970. now a renovated, modern hotel. Hendrix lived a famously unsettled life as a constantly traveling musician and lived for short periods in numerous places in New York and other cities. John Storyk, a Manhattan architect who helped Hendrix design the recording studio studio and its acoustics, said he recalled Hendrix living in the cottage. Obtaining a street co-naming — the honorary name is typically posted along with the original street name — requires a proposal to the local Community Board 2. If approved, a local Council member — Councilman Corey Johnson and Councilwoman Councilwoman Margaret Chin represent parts of the block — would then have to propose the co-naming to the full City Council for a vote. The Council typically approves about 100 new street names each year citywide. Bob Gormley, the district manager of Community Board 2, said the board’s guidelines ask applicants to explain in detail the nominee’s relationship and contributions to a block. Mr. Key was confident that he could make the case for Hendrix, who was known for his outsize musical success in only a handful of years as a prominent musician. He left behind Electric Lady, a cultural landmark, and the reputation he bestowed on the block has inspired locals for decades. Mr. Key, who has no documentation documentation to prove that Hendrix had actually actually lived in the cottage, said he and others had collected more than 1,000 signatures signatures on the street-naming petition and would try to shore up more community community support before starting the official submission process. He walked through his cottage, whose walls are sufficiently insulated that he hears very little music from the studio — except once, when Kanye West was recording. recording. “The walls were shaking,” he recalled. A small group from the party slipped out for a late night tour of Electric Lady Studios, where the likes of Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and David Bowie recorded. Lee Foster, the studio’s general manager, manager, told the group that while many original original features were preserved, including some instruments and hand-painted wall murals, the studio technology has been modernized since 1970 to audio engineering engineering levels that have attracted the likes of Lady Gaga, Adele and U2. Mr. Foster wore a necklace adorned with two silver-plated cigarette butts from a memorable memorable cigarette break with the Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richards. Mr. Foster walked through a spacious studio where Hendrix made some of his final recordings and where David Bowie and John Lennon came up with the song “Fame.” Back at the party, Mr. Key said he hoped the Hendrix energy and his music that still lingers along Eighth Street might help the block get its mojo back. “I’m worried about the gentrification of the block,” he said. “The history of New York gets lost sometimes and that’s what this is all about.” De Blasio Picks New Jails Boss Within System Acting Chief Given Job After Nationwide Search By J. DAVID GOODMAN After months of searching around the country for a new correction commissioner, commissioner, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday that he had found the person to head the Correction Department, which oversees the troubled Rikers Island Island jail complex, from within its own ranks. Mr. de Blasio said the agency would be led by Cynthia Brann, the acting commissioner commissioner who, like the former commissioner commissioner Joseph Ponte, came to New York City from Maine. She replaced Mr. Ponte on a temporary basis after his departure in June. “We thought she combined alignment on vision with real experience in making the changes and reforms needed,” Mr. de Blasio said of Ms. Brann during an unrelated unrelated news conference on Tuesday. “She knew the job, she knew the system, she knew the people. And I liked her approach approach to leadership.” The Correction Department is still plagued by persistent episodes of violence violence by some inmates and staff at Rikers Rikers Island, where a raft of reforms, federal federal oversight and steady investment have yet to create a stable atmosphere. The department has also been tasked by Mr. de Blasio with making changes that, along with reforms across a range of law enforcement agencies and courts, would result in the closing of Rikers Island as a jail complex after 10 years. Glenn E. Martin, who has led protests in favor of closing Rikers, said in a statement statement that City Hall should have hired an outside candidate for commissioner and that the choice of a current city correction correction official “suggests “suggests that the mayor mayor still fails to grasp the urgency of shuttering shuttering New York’s torture island.” The head of the correction officers union, Elias Husamudeen, said Ms. Brann had a front-row seat to the “failed reform Cynthia Brann policies of her predecessor,” predecessor,” and he expressed hope that she “will listen to the concerns and recommendations recommendations of the men and women who serve on the front lines of the city’s jails.” City Hall searched broadly for a replacement replacement for Mr. Ponte, who left amid a scandal surrounding his use of cityowned cityowned vehicles and a gas card for personal personal use, including trips back to a home he owned in Maine. Mr. Ponte and Mr. de Blasio have bristled at the suggestion of deliberate misuse or that Mr. Ponte had been forced to resign. “Commissioner Ponte was not dismissed, dismissed, let’s be clear, and it wasn’t because because of a mistake around some cars,” Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday in response response to a question. “It was time for him to retire. Let’s try to be accurate.” More than 20 correction employees — including Mr. Ponte and Ms. Brann — were accused by investigators from the city’s Investigation Department of improperly improperly using city vehicles. In Ms. Brann’s case, she told investigations investigations that she used her city-issued, takehome takehome car “almost exclusively for shopping,” shopping,” according to the Investigation Department’s Department’s report. Ms. Brann has reimbursed reimbursed the city for her misuse of the car. Several candidates were considered before City Hall chose Ms. Brann, who served for more than two decades at the Maine Department of Corrections before becoming deputy commissioner for quality quality assurance at the city’s Correction Department Department in 2015. Ms. Brann’s appointment appointment was reported by Politico New York. At one point, officials appeared to be strongly considering Dan Pacholke, who had spent three decades with the Washington Washington State Department of Correction. City officials went so far as to tour Rikers Island with Mr. Pacholke. Vincent Schiraldi, Schiraldi, who led the city’s Probation Department Department under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was also considered. A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio declined declined to comment on the candidates, beyond beyond saying that “nearly a dozen people were seriously considered.” Asked if any had been offered the job before Ms. Brann, Mr. de Blasio said “no.” “The offer was made to acting Commissioner Commissioner Brann because as we evaluated evaluated her work, and talked through with her her vision, I became convinced she was the right person for the job,” Mr. de Blasio Blasio said. City Hall officials cited her work in making organizational changes and in helping to roll out a new policy for when guards use force. Faced with pressure from the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, and from outside groups, Mr. de Blasio promised to close the jail complex in a decade. While he has not provided details, details, the mayor has said the plan will create create jails in several boroughs — but not Staten Island. Elected officials in Queens said on Monday they would support a new jail near the courthouse in that borough. Mr. de Blasio welcomed their support at Tuesday’s news conference.",10/4/2017,"('worried', 'about', 'the')","('the', 'block', 'he')","[' “I’m worried about the gentrification of the block,” he said.']", Im worried about the gentrification of the block he said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3288,1985348171,"Album PHOTOGRAPHS by HELEN LEVITT Shots From Underground THERE’S NO SHORTAGE of images from New York’s subway system. Yet for much of the last century, until 1994 in fact, photography in the city’s rapid transit system had been illegal illegal (albeit a rarely enforced offense). In the late 1930s, soon after the city imposed its ban, Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed commuters. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35-millimeter camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release. Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers. Ms. Levitt was soon taking subway portraits. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and eventually was nominated nominated for an Academy Award, she would return underground to photograph passengers. A new book, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades. It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring Art Deco posters, elaborate furs and jauntily tilted hats, while those from the 1970 s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, inarticulate, I express myself with images.” rena Silverman (LINE: ALONG FOR THE RIDE More of Helen Levitt’s pictures: nytimes.com/metropolitan READER COMMENTS In Metropolitan last Sunday, Ginia Bellafante wrote in her Big City column about how even an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour would still leave many families impoverished in high-cost New York. Readers responded on nytimes.com; comments have been edited for length and clarity. EVEN IF YOU MAKE $15 an hour, you could never live alone with the cheapest affordable studios being approximately SI,200, you’d be giving at least half your income, income, before taxes even. All of this is made even harder with a child, and harder still by actually having to pay bills or even provide provide adequate food. Good luck trying to get into any public housing housing and trying your best to keep you family safe. New York certainly certainly doesn’t need any more middle-income housing, nor expensive expensive ones either. DREW, NEW YORK IN PLACES LIKE New York and San Francisco, an increase in minimum wage is useless in face of the ongoing luxurification of housing and hyper-gentrification of neighborhoods. Regular people continue to be pushed out of neighborhoods. There is lots of housing being built in New York — but it is luxury housing for affluent, educated millennials and for wealthy people of all sizes and shapes, including many who do not reside in New York full time.

There comes a point when we all have to accept certain fiscal limitations. Is it fair? Fairness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Life, as we all know, isn’t fair in many senses, but that is sometimes, despite our best and most sincere efforts, the way it is. GEORGE S, NEW YORK IN 1961, WHEN I began working for a living, the minimum salary was $1 an hour. Google today’s value of a 1961 dollar and you get $8, the minimum today! No real raise of the minimum in 56 years. Why are we surprised that the poor who toil at the minimum wage cannot meet their payments, even working two jobs! This is one of the most shameful aspects of today’s politics and the pathetic members of Congress have no real sense of fairness and we keep re-electing them! GASTON, NEW YORK This Dance Party Won’t Die Readers also commented on Annie Correal’s article on El Deportivo, a social club in Washington Washington Heights where old-school Dominican merengue reigns: I see these folks and think, man, my life is terribly empty. What I actually mean, though, is that my wife and I need to learn how to dance (and find someplace to do it). And what I really, really mean is this country needs to focus on conversations, food, community and dancing. Everything Everything else is nonsense. DKM, NORTHEASTERN OHIO I CANNOT BELIEVE this place is still going strong. There is good news in the world! And I have to agree: Although I do listen to reggaeton and musica urbana, there is nothing like an old school merengue to get you on your feet. TINY, NEW YORK Bring a Leash, and Chutzpah And one reader quibbled with a fine point on language regarding Alix Strauss’s Sept. 24 article on a course sponsored by a Jewish nonprofit that teaches dogs commands commands in Yiddish: MY MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER, who spoke only Yiddish, died when I was 4, and so I was too young to learn the language from her. However, my mother used many Yiddish words and expressions expressions and I grew up in New York so this enabled me to acquire a rather extensive Yiddish vocabulary. vocabulary. And so I would like to correct your reporter’s definition of “kibitz,” “kibitz,” which she used to describe the manner of relating of the dog owners to each other after the Yiddish lesson was over. According to Webster’s Encyclopedic Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary, the second definition of kibitzer is “a person who jokes, chitchats or makes wisecracks.” I am pretty sure that is what the dog owners were doing, rather than standing around giving each other unwanted unwanted advice!

2202,2016710356,"10 Underseen Indies Worth Streaming Missed them the first time around? Here are several movies worth seeking out. By SCOTT TOBIAS Netflix and other streaming services have become reliable destinations for many fine independent films that spent little time in theaters (including a few Netflix productions productions released directly to the service). Here are 10 recent movies that are worth discovering. discovering. ‘Tallulah’ In this Netflix original, and the debut feature from the writer-director Sian Heder, a drifter (Ellen Page) kidnaps a neglected neglected child and passes it off as her daughter daughter to her absent boyfriend’s mother (Allison (Allison Janney). The setup just to get us there is a bit convoluted, and more context doesn’t make the drifter’s decisions much more explicable. explicable. But Ms. Heder, who wrote and produced for “Orange Is the New Black,” keeps the focus on the terrific odd-couple chemistry between Ms. Page and Ms. Janney, Janney, who squeeze all the laughs and pathos they can out of a sticky situation. (Netflix) ‘Christine’ On July 15,1974, Christine Chubbuck, Chubbuck, a broadcast journalist for Channel 40 in Sarasota, Fla., raised a pistol from underneath underneath her anchor desk and shot herself on live television. Her suicide was preceded by a critique of the station’s “blood and guts” news coverage, but Ms. Chubbuck’s true motives were far from clear cut. In this incisive incisive biopic from Antonio Campo, Rebecca Hall plays Ms. Chubbuck with an intensity that projects vulnerability and resolve in equal measure, as her acute feelings of alienation at home and in the workplace beckon her toward tragedy. Mr. Campos has a particularly good feel for how local news was generated in a casually sexist, maledominated maledominated field. (Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, Netflix, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu) ‘green is gold’ After his father is sent to prison, a 13-year-old boy moves to the hills of Northern California to live with his older brother, who runs a thriving illegal marijuana marijuana plot. This may sound like the premise for a scolding moral drama or a high-stakes drug thriller, but “Green Is Gold” dials it back in favor of a low-key, shaggy-dog character character study that continually defies expectation. expectation. The writer-director Ryon Baxter, who also stars as the older brother, doesn’t underplay underplay the dangers of this black-market operation, but themes of masculinity and personal growth are given as much weight as the drug trade.

His son and the shop proprietor’s proprietor’s son become instant friends, but they’re vulnerable to the unavoidable conflict between between landlord and tenant.

(Netflix, (Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu) ‘the eyes of my mother’ If this rural nightmare nightmare from Nicolas Pesce weren’t photographed photographed in luscious black and white, it would probably be too gruesome to bear. As it stands, “The Eyes of My Mother” is still not for the faint of heart, opening with a scene in which a little girl witnesses her mother’s murder by a serial killer. It hardly gets less disturbing from there. The killer is captured and chained in the family’s barn, and the girl grows into young adulthood torturing torturing him as a captive plaything, putting her mother’s surgical know-how to good use on him — and eventually others. Imagine a “Psycho” prequel with a much younger Norman Bates as the main character, and that perhaps begins to explain this film’s unsettling unsettling appeal.

The study lasted six harrowing harrowing days before Mr. Zimbardo was forced to end it. The results (and ethical shortcomings) shortcomings) of Mr. Zimbardo’s work earned a permanent permanent spot in psychology textbooks, and “The Stanford Prison Experiment” dramatizes dramatizes it with a straightforward, no-frills effectiveness. effectiveness. Michael Angarano does particularly particularly vivid work as a baby-faced “guard” whose John Wayne swagger curdles into sadism as he settles into his authoritarian role.

Mr. Blair starred as a bumbling bumbling amateur seeking revenge in “Blue Ruin,” and his directorial debut is cut from the same cloth, eking tension and black comedy out of an ordinary person’s operating operating on the wrong side of the law. In this case, that person is played by a terrific Melanie Lynskey, starring as a nursing assistant who recruits a neighbor (Elijah Wood) to help her track down the lowlifes who burgled burgled her home.

341,2610743989,"The Struggling Artist at 86 Harry Bertschmann wants to be discovered. By SUSAN CHUMSKY Like most struggling artists, Harry Bertschmann is hoping to be discovered. Unlike them, he already has a pedigree: he has shown his work alongside Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell while they were still alive and in their prime. In 1958, a large Bertschmann canvas was featured in the Carnegie International... exhibition in Pittsburgh, a rarefied achieve ment for any artist, let alone one in his mid-20s. Since then, Mr. Bertschmann has painted or drawn nearly every day of his adult life, producing a body of work that has been praised by some of the art world's fore most tastemakers. Yet he has remained vir tually unknown. ""I had to make money,"" Mr. Bertschmann, 86, said one morning in late November as he sat at the dining table of his light-filled, art- filled apartment-studio near South Street Seaport. And he did, working as a freelance graphic designer creating logos, packaging and advertising for brands like Pond's cold cream and Bufferin. His success at his day job ensured that he wasn't hungry, and while he has produced thousands (he has no idea how many thousands) of fine art paintings, drawings and collages in wildly CONTINUED ON PAGE 6 Harry Bertschmann, looking through his work, with his wife, Mary, in their apartment-studio near South Street Seaport. GEORGE ETHEREDGE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES The Struggling Artist at 86 CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 varied styles, he never persistently sought gallery representation. ""Harry's never been a salesman,"" said Mary Bertschmann, his wife of more than 50 years. ""He didn't get his art out there for them to see."" Nor did he carouse with his more exhibitionistic contemporaries at Ce dar Tavern, participate in splashy happen ings or attract art-world gossip. ""Also, we had started our own small press, and Harry was doing great designs for Harper Row, like this wonderful thing,"" she said, pointing to a fetchingly illustrated poetry anthology published in the 1970s. We were so into our world, plus, of course, with a child."" Over the years there were some exhibi tions and acquisitions, notably a 140-work retrospective in 1997 of both his commercial and fine art in Basel, Switzerland, where Mr. Bertschmann was born and raised. But these accomplishments never amounted to a self-sustaining fine art career. As he reached his 80s, humility and obscurity started getting old, and costly. Now the Bertschmanns find themselves in a tenuous financial position. Mr. Bertschmann no longer does much graphic design, and Mrs. Bertschmann recently re tired as the executive director of the Hugue not Society of America. She said that they have been ""suffering financially."" Despite living in a lofty one-bedroom apartment near the South Street Seaport, they are re tired renters who will not benefit from the gentrification of the neighborhood. On the bright side, she added, a man named Peter Hastings Falk had arranged for a couple of gallery owners to visit in De cember. Mr. Falk, an art historian, curator and ap praiser who has spent much of his '10-year career promoting unknown, highly accom plished artists, considered Mr. Bertschmann an unrecognized master. ""There couldn't be a better example,"" he said. Mr. Bertschmann's work, he added, ""is at such a high level that it is as compelling or more so than his more famous peers', all of the members of the New York School of the '50s and '60s."" With one crucial differ ence. While a large Bertschmann painting might, by Mr. Falk's estimate, sell for about 525,000, for an excellent Rothko you could add three zeros to that figure. And then mul tiply by three. mr. bertschmann is an elfin man with comely features and a warm smile, Mrs. Bertschmann a strikingly beautiful woman of 85. Last month, both of them were neatly dressed in similar gray V-neck sweaters as they nervously prepared their apartment for the gallerists' visit. He rarely fails to apologize for what he calls the mess in the living room, where his artwork rests against walls and sits on and in numerous metal cabinets. But the space isn't remotely untidy. His wife explains his fastidiousness by pointing out, ""He's Swiss."" Long before the arrival of Art Basel, the international art fair, Mr. Bertschmann's hometown was an ideal city for a budding artist, with world-class museums, a great university and, most important, an express train that reached Paris in under three hours. ""We would hop on the train,"" Mr. Bertschmann recalled. I was 16 or 17. These trips to Paris were very enlightening for me."" Right after World War II, he said, ""ev erybody was poor, and along the Seine there were booths, and you saw such fabulous stuff."" He showed off four 18th-century Jap anese prints and an African bronze that he'd bought back then for next to nothing. ""Imagine being that age,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said, ""and having a taste for those things."" From 1947 to 1951, Mr. Bertschmann at tended the Basel School of Design. He stud ied under Armin Hofmann and apprenticed with Fritz Biihler, both giants of Swiss graphic design. After graduation he moved to the United States, eventually landing in Cleveland, where his artistic output became more inventive and prolific. His work ap peared in several galleries, a painting was selected for the Carnegie International, and the Cleveland Museum of Art invited him to submit a painting for its annual group exhi bition. It won first prize. Cleveland was also where Mr. Bertschmann met Mary, who at the time was married to an adman who was part of a prominent Cleveland Heights family. ""One day Harry said he wanted to do some sketches of me,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. ""So 1 sat for Harry, and he did some sketches, and then he suddenly got up and came over and gave me a kiss. 1 was very proper, brought up in the Victorian way."" She continued, ""Something happened I guess the coup de foudre, as they say in French and we became lovers. Harry and I were lovers for 10 years before I finally got disentangled from my husband. Before I got the courage."" Her husband's agency transferred him to New York, she said, and he adapted quickly to Madison Avenue. ""He turned into a 'Mad man,""' she recalled. ""Two martinis for lunch."" The couple rented a three-bedroom duplex with a deck in the West Village that had just been vacated by the actress Tammy Grimes, who had recently sepa rated from Christopher Plummer. Before the move, Mrs. Bertschmann recalled, ""I said, Tom, we'll never be able to afford this apartment it's $350!"" In 1962, she persuaded Mr. Bertschmann that as an artist, he, too, should come to New York. When her marriage finally ended, her husband moved out of the du plex, and in 1966 she married Mr. Bertschmann ""my true love,"" she said. They stayed in the duplex for four decades, until about 15 years ago, when the landlord died and their rent (then $3,000 a month) was about to jump. Now they face a similar fate with their current apartment The once-modest Sea port neighborhood is getting fancier. The Best Western a few doors down is trans forming into a Cipriani boutique hotel. With both of them on fixed incomes and with no retirement plans to speak of, their high monthly rent, Mrs. Bertschmann said, has them ""hanging by a string."" Of course, at some point they should have bought an apartment, an option that Mrs. Bertschmann said they considered ""so many times."" But they were busy leading creative, exhilarating New York lives. They spent 4 0 years in an affordable duplex in the most cinematic part of the West Village, so why move? They raised a daughter (Isa- belle Kellogg, now a luxury marketer with a grown daughter of her own) and had inter esting friends and neighbors, like an editor who worked with Diana Vreeland at Vogue and later Graydon Carter, the longtime Van ity Fair editor, who bought the townhouse next door. Every summer they took a hiking vacation in the Swiss Alps and visited Mr. Bertschmann's family in Basel. But now their need to pay the bills is over shadowing even their desire for Mr. Bertschmann's work to get its due. He still draws every day, but he no longer paints. ""He doesn't have the money for art sup plies,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. So the couple are putting their hopes in the hands of Mr. Falk, promoter of the un discovered. Mr. Bertschmann first met him back in 2013 after reading an article about a show of works by another overlooked paint er, Arthur Pinajian, and deciding that he would like some recognition before he met the same fate. (Mr. Pinajian had been dead 14 years before he was discovered.) Mr. Falk had organized that show, and when Mr. Bertschmann approached him, he was skeptical at encountering yet another hope ful. ""I thought, Oh, no,"" Mr. Falk said. ""Be cause I can only take on one or two a year."" Still, he agreed to look at Mr. Bertschmann's work. The reaction was immediate. ""1 was astounded,"" Mr. Falk recalled. The more he saw, the more he liked. ""Harry's special,"" he said. ""I knew it as soon as he was showing me digital images, and then 1 was abso lutely convinced when I saw thousands of works over 60 years in his apartment."" Through his company, Artist Discovery Group, Mr. Falk brings together museum curators, gallery owners, critics and col lectors the art market's power centers and works to catalyze interest in the artists. The main obstacle, as he sees it, is the ""pathological myopia of the art world."" In its narrow view, an artist, especially an older one, whose work hasn't already been certi fied by the market barely even exists. If Google and auction records scarcely know that Mr. Bertschmann is alive, it hardly matters that in 1986 Henry Geldzahler, the larger-than-life curator at the Metropolitan Museum, visited his studio and found his work stellar. Mr. Geldzahler put in a good word at several major galleries, the Bertschmanns said, but when Mr. Bertschmann pursued those leads nothing came of them. To help fill the data vacuum and provide scholarly legitimacy, Mr. Falk enlisted Robert C. Morgan, a member of his compa ny's advisory board of scholars and cura tors, to write an essay characterizing and validating Mr. Bertschmann's work. He also found a small gallery on the western edge of SoHo called Studio Vendome to mount a show in 2014. But it was poorly attended, partly a result of a small marketing budget. Such are the challenges of promoting un derrated talent Since the Studio Vendome show, Mr. Bertschmann has had some qualified suc cess the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, recently acquired one of his travel posters for its permanent collection but more setbacks. He read about a gallery that specializes in older artists, sub mitted his materials in person, and was told that there was a waiting list of 250 artists ahead of him. Then in November, Mr. Falk told him about Christy and Chester Murray, lifelong collectors and neophyte gallerists. One night about five years ago, a friend and some wine persuaded the Murrays, who had recently retired, to buy a store in Quogue, on the East End of Long Island, and turn it into an art gallery. Mr. Falk thought their taste for New York School painters might draw them to Mr. Bertschmann's work. In 2015, Mr. Falk had helped the Murrays bring an exhibition of more than 20 Pinajian works on paper to the Quogue Gallery, and it sold out. (To date, total Pinajian sales from all venues have exceeded 53.5 million, according to Mr. Falk.) Hoping to repeat this success, he set up a meeting with the Murrays last month at the Bertschmanns' apartment. The Murrays spent more than two hours there, and left feeling transported. ""We walked in thinking that maybe Harry would be part of a group show,"" Christy Murray said, ""and left planning a solo show during some of the busiest weeks of the summer."" Less than a week later, they sent an email clarifying those plans, which center on a solo exhibition filling the Quogue Gallery for three weeks next summer. They also de cided to double the size of their booth at Art Palm Beach, a fair in Florida that starts Jan. 17, to accommodate seven large Bertschmann canvases. And, as with their previous shows, they expect to buy one or more of Mr. Bertschmann's paintings for their private collection, which, in addition to emerging and overlooked artists, includes works by Picasso, Miro and Giacometti. The Bertschmanns were almost afraid to believe that their hoped-for lifeline had ar rived, but they allowed themselves to cele brate with a bottle of wine. ""It was so won derful to meet them and to have them be so interested in everything that Harry had done,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. ""They just kept looking and looking."" She called the visit ""flabbergasting"" and ""magical."" Even Mr. Bertschmann, always affable but rarely effusive again, he's Swiss was visibly happy. Could it really be true that all his years of ""painting like a demon possessed,"" as Mr. Falk put it, could finally be re warded? Mr. Falk called the Murrays' plans ""a good fresh start for Harry."" Small galleries, he noted, can be more adventurous, less in thrall to youth and trends, than large ones. ""Ultimately, what I'd like to see for Harry is a museum exhibition,"" he said, ideally at the Swiss Institute in New York, which should ""finally pay homage to one of their own, an artist who's really, really deserving."" Repre sentatives of the Swiss Institute have met with Mr. Bertschmann and expressed an in terest in working with him, but they plan their shows far in advance, probably too far to help the Bertschmanns out of their cur rent financial plight. While Mr. Falk views the big picture, Mr. Bertschmann trains his eye on the sketch pad directly in front of him. Every day with out fail, he continues to put pencil to paper with such single-minded focus that he does n't see his own career arc, or plan for the fu ture. The other day, a guest raised the sub ject of where he hoped his body of work would end up after he was gone. He ap peared genuinely stumped.

In the 1980s, the building acquired another nickname, nickname, the Coyote Building, as its spire and towering flagpole were said to favor a baying coyote. By the late 2000s, the building had been dilapidated for some time, despite the gentrification of Wicker Park. In 2014, approval was granted to Grupo Habita, a boutique hotel operator based in Mexico, for a hotel conversion, and in late 2016, the Robey opened its doors.

Buck, a visionary art historian who revived the Brooklyn Brooklyn Museum’s original ambitions of being as celebrated in Manhattan Manhattan as it was around the world, died on March 30 in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 79. The cause was lung cancer, his son Thomas said. When he arrived in Brooklyn in 1983 from Buffalo, where he had run the Albright-Knox Art Gallery for 10 years, Mr. Buck was hailed as an evangelistic outlander who was passionately devoted to 20thcentury 20thcentury art. As the new director, he soon began began harnessing the buoyancy generated generated by the Brooklyn Bridge centennial centennial jubilee that year to kindle a renaissance at what was then a sleepy institution in the shadow of the great museums of Manhattan and often overlooked by fellow New Yorkers there. Robert A. Levinson, who was chairman of museum’s trustees when Mr. Buck was hired, expressed expressed his frustration at the time, telling The Times, “We’re better known around the country and world.” Mr. Buck hoped a revival of the museum, on the northern edge of Prospect Park, would dovetail with the gentrification of Brooklyn, then in its nascent stages. When he retired 13 years later, he was lauded for having launched an architectural competition that jump-started a dormant expansion plan, which, when realized, added 7 have no talent for making art, and have never lifted a brush or pen in my life, 9 30,000 square feet of gallery space and the 460-seat Iris and B.

The expansion was designed by the competition’s winners, Arata Isozaki and James Stewart Polshek Polshek of James Stewart Polshek & Partners in New York. While struggling to cope with government belt-tightening, Mr. Buck helped increase the endowment endowment to $40 million from $12 million million and established two endowed chairs: one for a curator of American American painting and sculpture, the other for a curator of arts of the Americas. He also reclaimed space by ousting ousting the museum’s art school — it was not accredited and enrollment was dropping — and showcasing the museum’s permanent African and Egyptian collections. (The art school moved to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.) Mr. Buck’s legacy included many popular exhibitions, among them “Matisse and the Mediterranean,” Mediterranean,” “The Machine Age in America: America: 1918-1941,” “Courbet Reconsidered” Reconsidered” and “Louise Bourgeois: The Locus of Memory, Works 1982what 1982what is now the Czech Republic.

Mr. Buck had brought a latebloomer’s latebloomer’s zeal to the mission he accepted accepted in Brooklyn. “I have no talent for making art, and have never lifted a brush or pen in my life,” he told The New York Times in 1985. “But as for analyzing analyzing and studying and comprehending comprehending works of art, and passing that to others, I’d say I can be pretty good.” Robert Treat Buck Jr. was born on Feb. 16,1939, in Fall River, Mass, to Robert Sr., a banker, and the former former Hazel Sayward. After graduating in 1961 from Williams College in Massachusetts, Massachusetts, where he majored in French, Mr. Buck enrolled in an executive training program at Chemical Bank New York Trust. The professional professional mismatch was apparent. (Sartorially, it was even more obvious obvious when he wore a madras sport coat to work on a warm day.) But college had not been for naught.

Since the British physicist Lord Kelvin first wrote about the subject subject in 1857, it had long been known that magnetic fields could affect the electrical resistance of magnetic materials like iron. Current Current flowed more easily along the field lines than across them. While this effect on electrical resistance resistance was useful for sensing magnetic fields and, in electronic heads, reading magnetic disks, it amounted to only a small change in the resistance, and physicists did not think there were many prospects for improvement.

556,2611732865,"A $54 Million Offer to Build Two Towers Pits Neighbor Against Neighbor By CHARLES V. BAGLI On the Lower East Side, $54 million looks a lot like a windfall in this once-teeming home to immigrant workers now firmly in the path of glass-tower development But a developer's offer to buy the unused development rights from the Seward Park Coopera tive has disrupted the leafy quiet of the four-building brick complex, pitting neighbor against neighbor. The developer, Ascend Group, hopes to use the purchased air rights to build two condominium towers at heights taller than would ordinarily be allowed by zoning laws 22 stories and 33 stories at the edge of the co operative, at East Broadway and Clinton Street Some Seward Park residents see the money as a welcome relief that would allow them to pay down the co-op's mortgage, make long-deferred repairs and reduce maintenance costs. Other residents, like Judy Pri gal, 82, a retired teacher who grew up in Seward Park, opposes the deal. She contends that Ascend's oversize towers will cast shadows across the complex's green lawns, block views and accelerate the gentrification of the Lower East Side. Residents may not be able to stem the surging tide of luxurious buildings elsewhere, Ms. Prigal said, but ""we have control over this one spot Putting up a humon- gous building will start to obliter ate the East Broadway side of Seward Park."" With the shareholders sched uled to vote Tuesday on whether to accept or reject the $54 million offer, residents said the debate has gotten heated, with fliers and emails from both sides setting off arguments. Opponents have set up card tables in the lobbies at Seward Park, next to posters that outline the benefits of the deal. Late last week, the developers threw in an additional $1 million sweetener if the deal is approved, on top of a recent pledge to pay the maintenance fees for all residents for four months. But if that was a carrot, the de veloper also showed that they wield a stick: They said they in tend to build two towers, albeit smaller ones at 17 and 20 stories, on lots they own next to Seward Park, even if they don't win the air rights. ""They're not stopping our de velopment,"" said Wayne Heicklen of the Ascend Group. ""We are building one way or another."" With that in mind, Doron Stem- ber, the president of the co-op board and a urologist, made his case for the sale. ""If we sell the air rights, the co op will end up with about $54 mil lion and larger buildings next door,"" Dr. Stember said. ""If we don't sell the air rights, there will still be dense construction but no revenue for the co-op."" The Lower East Side is not a stranger to development. Rem nants of the old neighborhood the tenements, bodegas and bak eries, the building that once held Bialystoker Center Home for the Aged, Kossar's Bagels and Bialys, Ming's Caffe, 169 Bar, the Sweet Life candy store sit alongside newcomers: the condo towers, Ice Vice, a store serving craft ice cream, and Malt Mold, which offers cheeses and craft beer. The 10-story Beaux-Arts home of the Jewish newspaper The For ward, with its reliefs of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, has been converted to condos on East Broadway. Seward Park, which sits on a tri angular 13-acre site between Grand Street and East Broadway, is one of four sister complexes on the Lower East Side that were built in the late 1950s by the gar ment workers unions as limited equity cooperatives. The four 21-story buildings comprising Seward Park were de signed by Herman Jessor with the idea that laborers were entitled to airy apartments, eat-in kitchens, balconies, grass lawns, land scaped hedges and doormen. Ms. Prigal, whose parents were among the original tenants, re calls the complex as an idyllic place: Most of the residents were Jewish, but the neighborhood was a mix of Latinos, Italians and Af rican-Americans. ""It was just a wonderful place,"" she said. ""The price of the apart ments was reasonable. They were clean, new apartments loaded with young families and children."" By the 1970s, the neighborhood was plagued by drugs and crime. Ms. Prigal later moved to the Up per West Side, before coming back to Seward Park eight years ago when she retired. After a stormy debate in the 1990s, the shareholders voted to allow their apartments to be sold on the open market ""It was as big a controversy then as the air rights are now,"" Ms. Prigal said. Before that outgoing residents had to sell their apartments back to the co-op for about the original price. The co-op in turn would re sell the unit for a similar sum, en suring that the complex remained affordable to working- and lower- middle-class residents. Residents who sell their apart ments today are assessed a ""flip tax"" by the co-op of either 17.5 per cent or 5 percent, depending on whether the unit is changing hands for the first time since the conversion in 1995. Over time, the number of apart ments has fallen to about 1,602 from 1,728 as residents combined units. The apartments sell for as much as $1.1 million. Mr. Heicklen said he and his business partner at Ascend, Robert Kaliner, were attracted to the Lower East Side because it was ""an emerging neighborhood"" that evoked a ""lot of nostalgia"" of a bygone era in New York. They bought three parcels on East Broadway in 2016, knowing that they might be able to buy the unused development rights, or air rights, from the co-op, enabling the developers to build taller tow ers with a total of about 200 condo miniums. The two towers would be erected on either side of the for mer Bialystoker nursing home, a landmark that will become a lobby for the towers. The developers anticipate that about three-quarters of the con dos would sell for less than $2.5 million. ""One of the great things about the neighborhood is that it's filled with a very diverse group of peo ple, every religion, every national ity,"" Mr. Heicklen said. The co-op board began negoti ating with the developers 17 months ago, with the price even tually rising to $54 million ($39 million after taxes) from over $40 million. Since then, the board has held more than a dozen informa tional meetings for tenants. Based on a survey of residents, Dr. Stember, the board president, said a portion of the proceeds would be used pay down the com plex's debt, with another S12 mil lion set aside for replacing eleva tors, repairing terraces and doing facade work. He said that if the co-op does not take the money, shareholders will face increased maintenance and assessment fees, which will accel erate the departure of lower-in come residents and older resi dents living on fixed incomes. Dana Linett-Silver, who has lived at Seward Park since 1999 with her husband and three chil dren, said the proposal ""makes fi nancial sense."" But Jerilea Zempel, a retired college professor whose views will not be affected by the project, describes the developer's pro posed luxury towers as ""big and grotesque"" hulks that will proba bly ""reverse"" the diversity of the neighborhood. Leslie Levinson Chu com plained that the views from her first-floor apartment would be blocked by the planned towers a couple dozen feet from her win dows. Other critics said the benefits of the deal will be fleeting. The co-op will survive, as it has for the past 60 years. They say the co-op could instead increase rents for the storefronts it owns and fees for the garage. Marion Riedel, a professor of social work at Columbia Univer sity, described the developer's in centives as ""bribes."" ""I love Seward Park,"" she said, ""but I don't like the overdevel opment of the Lower East Side."" The developers have vowed to build no matter what happens on Tuesday. But if shareholders re ject their offer, they may also re nege on their promises to avoid construction work on Saturdays and to start any pile-driving or loud work after 8 a.m. ""If we don't buy the air rights,"" Mr. Heicklen said, ""we won't be bound by some of the concessions we made.""

His years wearing a badge in Brooklyn, the police said, would prove to be on-the-job training training for a second career as a purveyor purveyor of prostitutes and protector of pimps. “Because of his familiarity with the tools of the trade and vice — and how to investigate these kind of enterprises — he kind of became became expert,” said a law enforcement enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case. “He figured, wow, he can make a lot of money.” City officials were quick to claim credit for smashing the brothel-and-gambling ring, saying saying that the arrests offered evidence evidence that the Police Department could police itself. Still, Mr. Paz’s apparent success at evading detection detection for years underscores the enduring power of the “blue wall of silence,” whereby officers stay quiet about the misdeeds of their colleagues. The case also casts new doubt on the department’s Internal Affairs Affairs Bureau, which has in the past faced questions about its anticorruption anticorruption programs and has a spotty record of uncovering major malfeasance. malfeasance. Department officials defended their anticorruption programs, but acknowledged that the Paz case was prompting them to examine examine whether they need to put new ones in place. Mr. Paz is in protective custody in jail, and his lawyer declined to be interviewed for this article. But his rise and fall was pieced together together by reporters for The New York Times who conducted dozens of interviews with current and former former law enforcement personnel, Mr. Paz’s family members and others. The reporters also visited locations of brothels and gambling gambling parlors across the city. The interviews and court records portrayed a crime boss who relied upon seven police officers officers he had met over his years on the job to be his crew — his legmen, legmen, his doormen, his bagmen. Most important, they were Mr. Paz’s inside men, tipping him off to raids and betraying one of the most sacred trusts in law enforcement: enforcement: the identities of undercover officers. Wiretaps revealed Mr. Paz’s contacts with the officers on the force who were later arrested and accused of being his accomplices. accomplices. The contents of the wiretaps wiretaps were recounted to The Times by senior law enforcement officials. officials. The syndicate thrived because of its secret weapons — all seven of them — and yet it was done in from within. In the end, the “blue wall” finally finally cracked. The whistle-blower was a fellow officer who called the Internal Affairs Bureau with a tip. ‘Pretty Blatant’ The women’s pictures appeared on Backpage.com and other sites notorious in the sex trafficking world. Selfies, grinning and topless. topless. “I’m a fun, flirty, sexy & bubbly bubbly girl who just wants to hang out and have some fun,” one ad read. She listed her location: an apartment on Fourth Avenue near 11th Street in Brooklyn, on the border border between Gowanus and Park Slope. This was how Mr. Paz attracted customers for his syndicate, the police said. New ones arrived looking for the women advertised on their phones, only to be met by a bizarre requirement. They were ordered to drop their pants and submit to a fondling before before engaging with prostitutes. The screening was Mr. Paz’s idea, the police said, a clever way to weed out undercover officers. From his time on the vice squad, Mr. Paz knew that undercover police police officers are barred from exposing exposing themselves in interactions with prostitutes. After submitting to the screening, screening, and the vast majority did, the customer paid, was handed a playing card as a receipt and proceeded proceeded to the next room to select a prostitute, the police said. A 15-minute session cost $40, a full hour, $160 or more. The sessions sessions played out in seedy little plywood plywood stalls within the apartment on Fourth Avenue. Other brothels across Brooklyn and Queens were in bedrooms lit by a bulb behind a red lampshade, with a dirty mattress mattress on the floor and a bottle of Febreze air freshener within arm’s reach. The syndicate operated at least seven of these brothels, along with “pop-up” rooms advertised on Backpage. (Law enforcement officials officials shut down Backpage this year.) Men outside wore jackets marked “Security.” Cameras watched from above. In Brooklyn, this boom in brothels brothels like the one on Fourth Avenue was playing out alongside the Annie Correal, Zoe Greenberg and Nate Schweber contributed reporting, reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research. gentrification of what was once the borough’s less-desirable edge, hard by a polluted canal. Now there was a Whole Foods a short walk away, and modern condos across the street advertised a fulltime fulltime doorman and residents lounge. New residents were arriving in the neighborhood and, like the old-timers, they were dismayed at what was happening in the building. building. “These guys were pretty blatant,” blatant,” said a worker at a nearby business who asked to remain anonymous. “You’d see a half dozen dozen guys coming and going at the same time — I always wondered why it was so obvious.” A former tenant at the Gowanus building said she started reporting reporting the sex operation to the police in January 2017, after she noticed lots of men visiting and talk of a massage table. She said nothing happened. At one point, a detective from the vice squad told her that the sex trade was impossible to stamp out, she said, and suggested she move. The police finally came with the battering ram in September 2017. Nothing there. Similar scenes were happening elsewhere. Sven Britt, a musician who lived in a building on Foster Avenue in Ditmas Park, said he first noticed a brothel there in September 2015. It advertised “hot Latinas” and “tight security and total discretion.” discretion.” He said he repeatedly called the police through August 2017 to report report the brothel, and visited the nearby 70th Precinct in person to report the issue. Again, nothing. “They never got in touch,” Mr. Britt said. It seemed whoever was running running the operation was untouchable. untouchable.

To save money for his Catholic education, education, his parents gave him water instead of juice at breakfast. “I expected him to become a lawyer,” his father said. But Ludwig Paz took the police test anyway and was sworn in as Officer Paz in October 1990 in a ceremony in Madison Square Garden. Garden. His father still felt disappointment, disappointment, but that was nudged aside by pride. “It was a good job — to protect the people, to be part of the good ULI SEIT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Detective Rene Samaniego would tell pimps when officers were on their way, officials say. side, not the bad side,” Luis Paz said in an interview. As a patrolman, Officer Paz was assigned to the 84 th Precinct, covering covering the brownstones and cobblestones cobblestones of Brooklyn Heights and Vinegar Hill. They called him “Pana,” slang for partner. One officer who was actually his partner, Officer Giancarlo Giancarlo Raspanti, was perhaps the first of the seven he would work beside. More than two decades later, Officer Raspanti would end up in handcuffs with Mr. Paz. By 2002, Detective Paz was on the Brooklyn Vice Squad, where he learned the inner workings of street crime at its most sordid. To get inside required going undercover, undercover, entering the realm of pimps and prostitution and speaking their language. By all accounts, Detective Paz ULI SEIT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES was a quick study. Along the way, he met several other officers whose names, in the far-off year of 2018, would appear beside his own in a sweeping indictment indictment detailing corruption and prostitution. Among them: Giovanny RojasAcosta, RojasAcosta, Carlos Cruz, Cliff Nieves and, most notably for his actions as described by the police, Rene Samaniego, who would tell pimps when undercover officers were planning to visit a brothel and describe describe what they looked like. Detective Paz was married, and he and his wife, Sonia, and their young son, Ludwig Raphael, lived in the same small building, above an auto-parts shop, as Detective Paz’s parents. He and Mrs. Paz went to comedy clubs in Manhattan. Manhattan. Detective Paz took his son to the arcade and for hikes in state parks. “Growing up with him, he was my hero, because in my eyes, police police officers were the ones who did the right thing,” his son, now 28, said in an interview. New Love and Bankruptcy But by the mid-2000s, Detective Paz’s family life began to crumble. He had met another woman, apparently apparently through his work on the vice squad. Law enforcement officials said the woman, Arelis Peralta, was inside inside a brothel that the vice squad raided, though they did not say why she was there. Detective Paz let her slip out the back door when the police arrived, the officials said. The detective and Ms. Peralta began a romance. His wife had moved to Puerto Rico and was waiting for him to join her and their son. Instead, he asked for a divorce. By November 2006, he had moved to a single-family house in Ozone Park, Queens, with Ms. Peralta. Ms. Peralta, who was arrested on Sept. 12 along with Mr. Paz, did not respond to requests for comment. comment. Back then, Detective Paz, perhaps perhaps thinking back to the cramped building above the auto parts store, did what a lot of Americans Americans did. He borrowed too much. And, like a lot of others in 2008, he was swept into the financial crisis, crisis, failing to make monthly payments payments on his subprime mortgage The police say brothels were operated in apartments on Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, above center, and on Gates Avenue, top, as well as other sites. Some were in bedrooms with a dirty mattress on the floor. Officer Giancarlo Raspanti, at left in cap, one of Ludwig Pazs partners on the force, was arraigned this month. loans and filing for bankruptcy. Detective Paz owed more than $690,000 on subprime mortgages, according to court records. That same year, he earned $120,000 on his police salary, with overtime. On a later wiretap, the law enforcement enforcement official said, he was heard telling an associate that he started working in prostitution in 2008 — not as an arresting officer, but as a player. He retired in 2010. “Twenty and out,” officers call it, the club of retirees retirees who leave as soon as their pension kicks in at 20 years. ‘Expect Visitors Today’ The calls came for Mr. Paz at all hours. Mostly, it was Detective Samaniego from the vice squad. Mr. Paz would listen, hang up and call one of his brothels, said a law enforcement official who has listened listened to wiretap recordings of the conversations. ‘“My friend has said that you are to expect visitors today’,” Mr. Paz would tell the brothel, the official official said. “And then they knew what to do. They shut the place down.” Other calls were more specific. Mr. Paz never sounded panicked. Always relaxed. “Hey, the U.C. is walking up the block,” Mr. Paz said, according to prosecutors, using the abbreviation abbreviation for undercover officer. “An Asian,” he said, “with a beard.” In hindsight, it would seem reckless for a retired detective to speak so openly on the telephone. “If we believe what he said, that he was doing this since 2008, he’d been doing it for 10 years now and nothing happened to him,” the law enforcement official said. “So why not speak freely on the phone?” The officers working with Mr. Paz helped in many ways, the police police said. Some watched the door at the brothels, collecting cash. They arrested arrested his competitors. When Mr. Paz’s workers were arrested in unforeseen raids, officers looked up the arrest records to glean information information to protect the operation. operation. The fear of an arrested employee employee “flipping” and informing on the operation was constant. Operation Zap Wednesday, Sept. 12: This time, there were no warnings. The police waited until 1 p.m., when the brothels were open for business, and struck three of them quickly, arresting everyone they found. At one location, officers even handcuffed a 72-year-old superintendent superintendent who, after convincing convincing them he had nothing to do with any crimes, was released. The raids were the culmination of an investigation that started with a 2015 telephone tip to the Internal Internal Affairs Bureau. It came from a police officer. Three years later, the tipster, still unnamed, would be praised by Commissioner James P. O’Neill at a news conference as “a cop who recognized that the behavior and actions of even one of our members reflects on every single member of this police department.” department.” Thousands of hours of surveillance surveillance and recordings of calls had been collected. The investigation took so long because of its secrecy, the police said. Policing the police without tipping off the officers brings its challenges. Still, a police spokesman, Phillip Walzak, said the department department was investigating whether there were instances when the crimes described in the case could have been detected sooner. “Thus far those efforts have not identified such an instance,” Mr. Walzak said. Internal Affairs routinely routinely conducts integrity tests in search of corruption, he said. “Those tests are more frequent and much improved from years past,” he said. Mr. Paz and Ms. Peralta were the first to be arrested, handcuffed handcuffed at Kennedy International Airport, where they were waiting to board a flight to Las Vegas for a vacation. Their luggage left without without them. A search of their home uncovered uncovered $20,000 in cash, the police said. Mr. Paz and the arrested officers officers all entered pleas of not guilty. Officials said they did not anticipate anticipate more officers being arrested unless new information surfaces. By the time top police officials gathered in 1 Police Plaza to announce announce the arrests, the case had been assigned a code name: Operation Operation Zap, because it was the name of the former vice detective accused of running the syndicate, spelled backward. But investigators on the case had already chosen a different code name, one that spoke to the nature of the crimes said to have been masterminded by the former vice detective named Ludwig Paz. They called it: Protection Detail.

1728,2610761814,"A Brothel Ring, an Ex-Detective And a 'Blue Wall' That Cracked This article is by Michael Wilson, Ashley Southall, Alan Feuer, Al Baker and Ali Winston. The complaints from neighbors about prostitution flourishing behind the Brooklyn apartment's thin walls had been flowing into the vice squad for months. Men, arriving at all hours, were asked at the door which nationality of women they preferred: ""Brazil? Peru?"" Police officers swooped in one day in September 2017, slamming through the door with a battering ram, but they left empty-handed. The brothel on the border of Go- wanus and Park Slope had quietly closed down before the raid, just as had happened with several other brothels around the bor ough, gone dark right before the police showed up. The brothel empire was always one step ahead of the law. This month, prosecutors dis closed why: They said the broth els were run by a retired police de tective who had been repeatedly tipped off about planned raids by officers on the force, revealing one of the worst corruption scandals to hit the New York Police Depart ment in years. The retired detective, Ludwig Paz, 51, was arrested and accused of running a broad and complex syndicate of prostitution and gam bling that spanned Brooklyn and Queens and brought in millions of dollars. Three sergeants, two de tectives and two officers were also charged. Tvo other officers were stripped of their guns and shields and placed on administrative duty. Dozens of civilians were ar rested, and more are being sought. Police corruption in New York City has long revealed its share of notorious characters the rook ies working as muscle for drug dealers, the veteran investigators in the pockets of Mafia bosses, the shakedowns and favors and kick backs. But Mr. Paz, as portrayed by prosecutors, represents an un usual breed: a vice detective who kept a clean record until he re tired, only to pivot hard and use Continued on Page 25 Ludwig Paz pleaded not guilty. A Brothel Ring, an Ex-Detective and a Blue Wall That Finally Cracked From Page 1 his law-enforcement background to become the very strain of crime lord that he once was supposed to stamp out. His years wearing a badge in Brooklyn, the police said, would prove to be on-the-job train ing for a second career as a pur veyor of prostitutes and protector of pimps. ""Because of his familiarity with the tools of the trade and vice and how to investigate these kind of enterprises he kind of be came expert,"" said a law enforce ment official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case. ""He figured, wow, he can make a lot of money."" City officials were quick to claim credit for smashing the brothel-and-gambling ring, say ing that the arrests offered evi dence that the Police Department could police itself. Still, Mr. Paz's apparent success at evading de tection for years underscores the enduring power of the ""blue wall of silence,"" whereby officers stay quiet about the misdeeds of their colleagues. The case also casts new doubt on the department's Internal Af fairs Bureau, which has in the past faced questions about its anticor- ruption programs and has a spotty record of uncovering major mal feasance. Department officials defended their anticorruption programs, but acknowledged that the Paz case was prompting them to ex amine whether they need to put new ones in place. Mr. Paz is in protective custody in jail, and his lawyer declined to be interviewed for this article. But his rise and fall was pieced togeth er by reporters for The New York Times who conducted dozens of interviews with current and for mer law enforcement personnel, Mr. Paz's family members and others. The reporters also visited locations of brothels and gam bling parlors across the city. The interviews and court records portrayed a crime boss who relied upon seven police offi cers he had met over his years on the job to be his crew his leg men, his doormen, his bagmen. Most important, they were Mr. Paz's inside men, tipping him off to raids and betraying one of the most sacred trusts in law enforce ment: the identities of undercover officers. Wiretaps revealed Mr. Paz's contacts with the officers on the force who were later arrested and accused of being his accom plices. The contents of the wire taps were recounted to The Times by senior law enforcement offi cials. The syndicate thrived because of its secret weapons all seven of them and yet it was done in from within. in the end, the ""blue wall"" fi nally cracked. The whistle-blower was a fellow officer who called the Internal Affairs Bureau with a tip. 'Pretty Blatant' The women's pictures appeared on Backpage.com and other sites notorious in the sex trafficking world. Selfies, grinning and top less. ""I'm a fun, flirty, sexy bub bly girl who just wants to hang out and have some fun,"" one ad read. She listed her location: an apartment on Fourth Avenue near 1 1th Street in Brooklyn, on the bor der between Gowanus and Park Slope. This was how Mr. Paz attracted customers for his syndicate, the police said. New ones arrived looking for the women advertised on their phones, only to be met by a bizarre requirement. They were ordered to drop their pants and submit to a fondling be fore engaging with prostitutes. The screening was Mr. Paz's idea, the police said, a clever way to weed out undercover officers. From his time on the vice squad, Mr. Paz knew that undercover po lice officers are barred from ex posing themselves in interactions with prostitutes. After submitting to the screen ing, and the vast majority did, the customer paid, was handed a playing card as a receipt and pro ceeded to the next room to select a prostitute, the police said. A 15-minute session cost SdO, a full hour, S160 or more. The ses sions played out in seedy little ply wood stalls within the apartment on Fourth Avenue. Other brothels across Brooklyn and Queens were in bedrooms lit by a bulb behind a red lampshade, with a dirty mat tress on the floor and a bottle of Febreze air freshener within arm's reach. The syndicate operated at least seven of these brothels, along with ""pop-up"" rooms advertised on Backpage. (Law enforcement offi cials shut down Backpage this year.) Men outside wore jackets marked ""Security."" Cameras watched from above. In Brooklyn, this boom in broth els like the one on Fourth Avenue was playing out alongside the gentrification of what was once the borough's less-desirable edge, hard by a polluted canal. Now there was a Whole Foods a short walk away, and modern condos across the street advertised a full- time doorman and residents lounge. New residents were arriving in the neighborhood and, like the old-timers, they were dismayed at what was happening in the build ing. ""These guys were pretty bla tant,"" said a worker at a nearby business who asked to remain anonymous. ""You'd see a half doz en guys coming and going at the same time I always wondered why it was so obvious."" A former tenant at the Gowanus building said she started report ing the sex operation to the police in January 2017, after she noticed lots of men visiting and talk of a massage table. She said nothing happened. At one point, a detective from the vice squad told her that the sex trade was impossible to stamp out, she said, and suggested she move. The police finally came with the battering ram in September 2017. Nothing there. Similar scenes were happening elsewhere. Sven Britt, a musician who lived in a building on Foster Avenue in Ditmas Park, said he first noticed a brothel there in September 2015. It advertised ""hot Latinas"" and ""tight security and total discre tion."" He said he repeatedly called the police through August 2017 to re port the brothel, and visited the nearby 70 th Precinct in person to report the issue. Again, nothing. ""They never got in touch,"" Mr. Britt said. It seemed whoever was run ning the operation was untouch able. Learning the System Before he was Defendant Paz standing in handcuffs in a court room and before he was Detective Paz or Officer Paz, he was just an other hopeful young man telling his father what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to be a cop. His father, Luis Paz, had misgiv ings. The family had moved to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, from Ec uador when Ludwig was 8. To save money for his Catholic edu cation, his parents gave him water instead of juice at breakfast ""1 expected him to become a lawyer,"" his father said. But Ludwig Paz took the police test anyway and was sworn in as Officer Paz in October 1990 in a ceremony in Madison Square Gar den. His father still felt disap pointment, but that was nudged aside by pride. ""It was a good job to protect the people, to be part of the good side, not the bad side,"" Luis Paz said in an interview. As a patrolman, Officer Paz was assigned to the 8J th Precinct, cov ering the brownstones and cob blestones of Brooklyn Heights and Vinegar Hill. They called him ""Pana,"" slang for partner. One officer who was actually his partner, Officer Gian- carlo Raspanti, was perhaps the first of the seven he would work beside. More than two decades later, Officer Raspanti would end up in handcuffs with Mr. Paz. By 2002, Detective Paz was on the Brooklyn Vice Squad, where he learned the inner workings of street crime at its most sordid. To get inside required going under cover, entering the realm of pimps and prostitution and speaking their language. By all accounts, Detective Paz was a quick study. Along the way, he met several other officers whose names, in the far-off year of 2018, would appear beside his own in a sweeping in dictment detailing corruption and prostitution. Among them: Giovanny Rojas- Acosta, Carlos Cruz, Cliff Nieves and, most notably for his actions as described by the police, Rene Samaniego, who would tell pimps when undercover officers were planning to visit a brothel and de scribe what they looked like. Detective Paz was married, and he and his wife, Sonia, and their young son, Ludwig Raphael, lived in the same small building, above an auto-parts shop, as Detective Paz's parents. He and Mrs. Paz went to comedy clubs in Manhat tan. Detective Paz took his son to the arcade and for hikes in state parks. ""Growing up with him, he was my hero, because in my eyes, po lice officers were the ones who did the right thing,"" his son, now 28, said in an interview. New Love and Bankruptcy But by the mid-2000s, Detective Paz's family life began to crumble. He had met another woman, ap parently through his work on the vice squad. Law enforcement officials said the woman, Arelis Peralta, was in side a brothel that the vice squad raided, though they did not say why she was there. Detective Paz let her slip out the back door when the police arrived, the officials said. The detective and Ms. Peralta began a romance. His wife had moved to Puerto Rico and was waiting for him to join her and their son. Instead, he asked for a divorce. By November 2006, he had moved to a single-family house in Ozone Park, Queens, with Ms. Peralta. Ms. Peralta, who was arrested on Sept. 12 along with Mr. Paz, did not respond to requests for com ment. Back then, Detective Paz, per haps thinking back to the cramped building above the auto parts store, did what a lot of Amer icans did. He borrowed too much. And, like a lot of others in 2008, he was swept into the financial cri sis, failing to make monthly pay ments on his subprime mortgage loans and filing for bankruptcy. Detective Paz owed more than 3690,000 on subprime mortgages, according to court records. That same year, he earned S120,000 on his police salary, with overtime. On a later wiretap, the law en forcement official said, he was heard telling an associate that he started working in prostitution in 2008 not as an arresting officer, but as a player. He retired in 2010. ""Twenty and out,"" officers call it, the club of re tirees who leave as soon as their pension kicks in at 20 years. 'Expect Visitors Today' The calls came for Mr. Paz at all hours. Mostly, it was Detective Samaniego from the vice squad. Mr. Paz would listen, hang up and call one of his brothels, said a law enforcement official who has lis tened to wiretap recordings of the conversations. '""My friend has said that you are to expect visitors today',"" Mr. Paz would tell the brothel, the offi cial said. ""And then they knew what to do. They shut the place down."" Other calls were more specific. Mr. Paz never sounded panicked. Always relaxed. ""Hey, the U.C. is walking up the block,"" Mr. Paz said, according to prosecutors, using the abbrevia tion for undercover officer. ""An Asian,"" he said, ""with a beard."" In hindsight, it would seem reckless for a retired detective to speak so openly on the telephone. ""If we believe what he said, that he was doing this since 2008, he'd been doing it for 10 years now and nothing happened to him,"" the law enforcement official said. ""So why not speak freely on the phone?"" The officers working with Mr. Paz helped in many ways, the po lice said. Some watched the door at the brothels, collecting cash. They ar rested his competitors. When Mr. Paz's workers were arrested in unforeseen raids, officers looked up the arrest records to glean in formation to protect the opera tion. The fear of an arrested employ ee ""flipping"" and informing on the operation was constant. Operation Zap Wednesday, Sept. 12: This time, there were no warnings. The police waited until 1 p.m., when the brothels were open for business, and struck three of them quickly, arresting everyone they found. At one location, officers even handcuffed a 72-year-old su perintendent who, after convinc ing them he had nothing to do with any crimes, was released. The raids were the culmination of an investigation that started with a 2015 telephone tip to the In ternal Affairs Bureau. It came from a police officer.

Costly Rent Control Battle Brews in California From First Business Page growing momentum of local efforts efforts to expand tenant protections. protections. “In the midst of the worst housing and homeless crisis that our country has ever seen, how does a bill that restricts local government’s government’s ability to address it go untouched?” asked Damien Goodmon, director of the Yes on 10 campaign, which is primarily funded by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. Proposition 10 has won prominent prominent endorsements from backers including the California Democratic Democratic Party and The Los Angeles Times. But opponents have also amassed editorials and broad support, support, mainly from a coalition of construction unions, nonprofit housing developers and local chambers of commerce. Among those fighting the initiative initiative is a relatively recent class of landlords — private equity firms like Blackstone Group, which accumulated accumulated a vast residential real estate portfolio after the housing market collapse a decade ago. Landlords warn that repealing the Costa-Hawkins law would create deep uncertainty among developers, developers, making California’s housing shortage worse by discouraging construction. “This is a serious problem, but the solution to that problem should not land solely on the rental rental housing industry,” said Tom Bannon, president of the California California Apartment Association, a landlords’ group. The California fight reflects a renters’ rights movement that is bubbling up in churches and community community centers across the country, country, a semi-coordinated stand of low-income tenants against the gentrifying American city. Last month in the Roxbury section of Boston, about 300 people gathered gathered for an afternoon assembly on how to blunt evictions and economic economic displacement. The event offered offered free child care and had organizers organizers speaking English, Spanish Spanish and Cantonese. Many of these groups are affiliated affiliated with a housing and racial justice justice group called Right to the City Alliance, whose Homes for All campaign has organized tenants in about 50 cities. Even outside California, Homes for All members members are closely following the Proposition Proposition 10 campaign. “We’re both watching and learning from how they are building building this broad-based movement,” said Lisa Owens, executive director director of City Life/Vida Urbana, a tenants’ rights group in Boston. STOCKS & BONDS Markets Struggle Back, but the Damage Is Done By The Associated Press Stocks rebounded on Friday, clawing back some of the week’s steep losses, but the turbulent trading of the last few days left no doubt that the relative calm the markets enjoyed all summer had been shattered. Major United States indexes ended the week down about 4 percent, percent, their worst weekly loss in six months. An index measuring the performance of small-company stocks had its worst week since early 2016. Big technology and consumerfocused consumerfocused companies led the recovery recovery on Friday. Longtime favorites of many investors, they had plunged in the last few days. A major factor cited by market watchers for the pullback was a sharp increase in interest rates, which can slow the economy and make bonds more attractive to investors investors relative to stocks. Apple stock climbed 3.6 percent to $222.11 and Microsoft stock In California and elsewhere, the problem is a lack of affordable housing that has led to cramped households, longer commutes and rising homelessness. About a quarter of the nation’s tenants paid more than half of their income income in rent in 2016, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies Studies at Harvard. Among the contributing factors are rising construction costs and increasingly stringent land-use regulations that have slowed construction construction and held back the supply of lower-cost rental housing. New building has skewed toward the upper end of the market, while the A movement spreads among churches and community centers across the country. share of the overall housing stock affordable to lower-income renters renters has declined.

With rents rising, tenants tenants who live in single-family homes that are ineligible for rent control, like Ms. Jimenez, have become become active in the Proposition 10 campaign, and she is a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, which is running the “Yes on 10” Campaign with the AIDS Healthcare Healthcare Foundation. Given how confusing it can be to explain the Costa-Hawkins law and how the ballot initiative would change things, Ms. Jimenez said that when she distilled her pitch to “everything is about rent control,” it resonated deeply with neighbors. neighbors. Economists have an almost universally universally dim view of rent control laws, and a number have supported supported the landlords’ contention that Proposition 10 could make California’s housing problems worse. Under current law, California California landlords can raise their rent as much as they like after a rentcontrolled rentcontrolled tenant leaves. If the Costa-Hawkins law is repealed, cities could write laws that barred them from ever raising their rents to market rates. That could prompt landlords to convert apartments into owner-occupied housing, worsening the shortage of affordable rentals. This does not, however, mean that economists are against proFederal proFederal Reserve chairman, helped set off a wave of selling in the bond market as investors bet that the economy would keep growing at a healthy pace. That pushed bond prices lower and sent yields up to seven-year highs. That drove interest rates sharply higher, which worried stock investors, who felt that a big increase could stifle economic growth. The big swings in the market on Friday suggested those fears had not gone away. “What seems to have driven this is a fear interest rates were going to rise more quickly because because the Fed was being too aggressive aggressive or the economy was going going to overheat,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan JPMorgan Funds. Mr. Kelly said he did not think either of those fears was justified. Shares of Ford and General Motors Motors continued to slump.

A number of scholars, including including Rebecca Diamond, a Stanford Stanford economist, have found that rent control laws slow displacement, displacement, particularly among poor or older tenants, but also accelerate gentrification. A stronger support system, such as tax credits that insure insure against increasing rents, could offer protection without distorting distorting the housing market. Tax credits are expensive to the state budget, however, and have little chance of becoming law any time soon. Rent control, by contrast, contrast, doesn’t cost taxpayers anything anything in dollars, at least not right away, and despite the long-term concerns of economists, it has the potential to help tenants now. Repealing the Costa-Hawkins law has been a goal of tenant advocates advocates almost since it was enacted enacted in 1995. But given the shoestring shoestring budgets of community groups, there had been no sustained sustained effort capable of funding a statewide political campaign. Enter Michael Weinstein, the president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. The foundation, the world’s largest AIDS charity, is on a pace to generate generate some $2 billion a year in revenue revenue in 2020, most of it from a chain of nonprofit pharmacies. While nonprofits are barred from engaging in partisan political political spending, they are free to run voter initiatives. Mr. Weinstein has become widely known for his willingness to bankroll state and local ballot measures, including an anti-development ordinance in Los Angeles, a statewide initiative to reduce the price California pays for pharmaceuticals and another that would have required condoms condoms in pornography. All failed. So far the “Yes on 10” campaign has raised about $17 million, virtually virtually all of it from the foundation. The landlords have raised $42 million. million. Support for the measure is trailing opposition among likely voters, according to a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California. Regardless of the outcome, the rent control battle seems unlikely to subside soon. Separate from Proposition 10, tenant activists have put rent control measures on the 2018 ballot in several California California cities, and are gathering signatures signatures for more after that. And Mr. Weinstein said that win or lose, he was not going away. If Proposition 10 fails, he has promised promised to pay for another bid to repeal repeal the Costa-Hawkins law, possibly possibly in 2020. “I’m kind of like gum on your shoe,” he said. most nine years, dipped 1.9 percent percent to $8.64.

Many of the newer rental buildings buildings carry high-end prices, while stock of affordable housing is actually falling. Given that, rent control is an easy and off-the-shelf policy tool that many people are familiar with — one that does help some renters and doesn’t appear to cost taxpayers money. “It is the best anti-displacement tool around,” said Stephen Barton, co-author of a recent report that called rent control a key measure toward stabilizing California’s housing market. And yet economists from both the right and the left are in almost almost universal agreement that rent control makes housing problems worse in the long run. Here’s what’s behind their thinking thinking and the nuances of the debate. debate. What does rent control do? Rent control or rent-stabilization laws are city-level prohibitions on rent increases beyond a certain certain amount. They are rare nationwide nationwide — 37 states prohibit their cities from enacting such laws — but have existed for decades in places including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. What is Proposition 10? Proposition 10 is a California voter initiative that would repeal a 1995 law called the CostaHawkins CostaHawkins Rental Housing Act. The law prevents localities from enacting certain forms of rent control. Notably, it exempts single-family homes from rent control laws, along with apartments apartments built after 1995. It also prevents something called vacancy vacancy control, allowing landlords to raise the rent without limit whenever a tenant under rent control moves out. How does vacancy control work? Let’s say a tenant is paying $1,000 a month and the market rate is $2,000 a month. Under current law, when the rent-controlled rent-controlled tenant moves out, the landlord is free to charge the next tenant $2,000 (or any other amount). Under vacancy control, the increase would still be regulated regulated and could go up only by the percentage allowed by local law. What if Proposition 10 fails? Rent control is still legal for a large share of California’s housing housing stock, and tenants continue to organize rent control drives up and down the state. It’s possible, even likely, that more California tenants will win some form of rent control in the next few years, regardless of what happens happens with Proposition 10. The main question is what units these laws will apply to and how stringent stringent the rules will be. What if Proposition 10 passes? Proposition 10 would repeal a state law that prevents local laws, but it wouldn’t make new law itself. If it passes, cities could enact more stringent and expansive expansive rent control laws, and some are already looking into it. But they don’t have to. Many won’t. What are the pros and cons? Tenants’ rights organizations argue that California’s affordability affordability crisis demands more rent-controlled units, as well as tools like vacancy control. They say the disparity between rentcontrolled rentcontrolled units and market rate prices encourages landlords to evict poorer residents in favor of people who can pay more. Vacancy Vacancy control could prevent this by regulating the rent regardless of who lives there: Why would landlords push tenants out if they couldn’t raise the rent for The S.&R 500 Index Position of the S.&R 500 index at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 2,780 2,760 Previous close 2 , 728.37 2,720 10 a.m. Source: Refinitiv Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m. THE NEW YORK TIMES cent to $1.94 a gallon.

On the other hand, most studies studies show that even though rent control is great for those who get it, the policies can lead to higher rents and fewer units over all. Is that the flaw of rent control? Yes. That said, nuance is something something you’re unlikely to hear in either side’s political commercials. commercials. One of the more frequently cited studies is a Stanford analysis analysis that found that rent control accelerated the gentrification of San Francisco’s Mission District by encouraging landlords to convert rental housing into higher-end condominiums and cooperatives. The study also concluded, however, that rent control lived up to the promise of reducing the displacement of lower-income tenants and older people. Economists have three main criticisms of rent control. They say it helps renters today at the expense of renters tomorrow. They also see it as a blunt instrument: instrument: While helping to stem economic displacement in the short term, it leads to long-run problems by encouraging landlords landlords to exit the rental business, and future landlords to not enter. And it can divert resources from low-income renters to those with moderate and even high incomes. incomes. In a 2002 study, San Francisco found that about a quarter of its rent-controlled units were occupied by households households with incomes over $100,000. That number has to be much higher today. What else should cities do? Some economists think they should build more housing. California California is one of the nation’s most heavily regulated building markets, markets, and has underproduced housing for decades. The state ranks 49th of 50 (above Utah) in the number of housing units per capita. Fewer homes = higher prices. Of course, this won’t do much for renters who are struggling now. To that end, a number of economists have suggested subsidies or tax credits as an alternative to rent control, because because they can shield renters from big price increases while being tailored to people who need the most help. “When people need health care, we give them Medicaid, and when they need food, we give them food stamps,” said Christopher Christopher Palmer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Technology. “But for housing, another basic human need, we tell people to get on a list and maybe in 10 years they’ll get a voucher for an apartment. That doesn’t match up with the immediacy of the need.” Mr. Palmer’s studies have suggested that rent control distorts distorts the housing market. But like many other economists, he is not opposed to greater government government efforts to help renters. The debate is about how to do it. Is there another way? Expanding vouchers and tax credits would require spending billions of dollars a year, a prospect that is not realistic any time soon. Recognizing this, the Terner Center for Housing Innovation Innovation at the University of California, California, Berkeley, has suggested that California adopt an antigouging antigouging measure that would cap rent increases at 10 percent a year and apply to all homes in the state, not just those covered by local rent control laws. “A middle-ground solution is critical because we cannot have a situation where we disinvest in rental housing at a time when we absolutely know we need it, and yet we have people who are being displaced and suffering, and that is not acceptable, either,” either,” said Carol Galante, faculty director of the Terner Center. mostly lower.

This year, the trolls wrote posts touching on immigration, guns, race relations, women and even the debate over the protests by National Football League players during the national anthem. Since April 2014, prosecutors said, Ms. Khusyaynova acted as the chief accountant for the project. But this time, prosecutors said the operatives appeared beholden to no particular candidate. Russia’s Russia’s trolls did not limit themselves to either a liberal or conservative position, according to the complaint. complaint. They often wrote from diverging diverging viewpoints on the same issue. “The conspiracy has a strategic goal, which continues to this day, to sow division and discord in the U.S. political system,” David Holt, an F.B.I. special agent, wrote in an affidavit. Prosecutors in Virginia, not Mr. Mueller’s team, charged Ms. Khusyaynova of conspiring to defraud defraud the United States. But those accusations appear to build on the special counsel’s earlier indictment, indictment, which also identified companies companies controlled by Mr. Prigozhin Prigozhin that were named again in the new complaint. One of the companies, Concord Management and Consulting, has fought the special counsel’s charges in court, demanding that the government demonstrate it willfully violated the law. Friday’s criminal complaint, with its detailed detailed descriptions of the conspiracy conspiracy continuing for months after February’s indictment, appears to do just that. Earlier Russian influence campaigns campaigns stood out for their clumsiness clumsiness — Facebook posts from the Internet Research Agency, another another arm of Project Lakhta that conducted Russia’s social media disruption campaign in 2016, often contained broken English and offtopic offtopic cultural references. But the new operations appear to have been more sophisticated, with smoother messaging and a better command of American political political discourse that allowed for more precisely targeted campaigns. campaigns. Operatives instructed their colleagues to frame posts about former Senator John McCain, McCain, Republican of Arizona, who tangled frequently with Mr. Trump before he died in August, as an “anti-Trump geezer.” Speaker Paul D.

A Tax Rule Meant to Help Distressed Areas Proceeds By JIM TANKERSLEY WASHINGTON — The Treasury Treasury Department outlined new rules on Friday stemming from the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul last year that are aimed at giving investors investors confidence to pour billions of dollars into distressed economic economic areas across the United States. Investment banks, venture capitalists capitalists and real estate developers have been eagerly awaiting guidance guidance for so-called opportunity zones, a sort of domestic tax haven haven that was created under the Republican tax bill that President Trump signed into law in December. December. The zones are devised to attract attract capital to urban, suburban and rural areas where investment has lagged after the Great Recession Recession — like broad sections of Detroit Detroit and Stockton, Calif. — by allowing allowing investors to avoid some taxes when they fund projects there. Treasury officials said on Friday Friday that the criteria would allow a wide variety of projects to qualify for the preferential tax treatment, including seed capital for start-up businesses in areas identified as opportunity zones. A looming question since the tax bill’s passage has been what type of investments would qualify for the preferential tax treatment conveyed by investing in an opportunity opportunity zone. An investor who rolls capital gains into an opportunity opportunity fund can eventually avoid up to 15 percent of the taxes otherwise otherwise owed on those investment gains. And the investor will never pay taxes on any gains the fund accrues in its investments in the DEMETRIUS FREEMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES A polling place in Brooklyn.

Acknowledging the time difference difference between Russia and the United States, one conspirator advised advised the others to post in the morning to attract liberal audiences audiences during the American evening — “L.G.B.T. groups are often active at night,” the operative operative wrote — and to seek out conservatives conservatives awake in the morning by posting just before they left work for the day. They also developed strategies for blending in to partisan American American audiences. “If you write posts in a liberal group ... you must not ‘It had nothing to do with my campaign/ the president said. use Breitbart titles,” read one message sent to the Russian group, referring to the conservative conservative American news site. “On the contrary, if you write posts in a conservative group, do not use Washington Post or BuzzFeed’s titles.” titles.” The group also gave suggestions, suggestions, some of them racist, for reaching specific affinity groups. One member suggested keeping posts simple when they were aimed at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups of color, writing that “colored L.G.B.T. are less sophisticated than white; therefore, complicated phrases and messages do not work.” Framing suggestions often acopportunity acopportunity zones, provided that the investment is held longer than 10 years. Proponents of the program have said the right type of structure structure could help drive money into distressed communities, generating generating economic growth and jobs. But critics have warned that the details details could simply hasten gentrification gentrification of areas that were already attractive places to invest and serve as a tax shelter for wealthy investors. Several lawyers and investment investment managers who reviewed the proposed regulation on Friday said it was likely to encourage a wide range of investments. “In almost almost all instances, these rules clarify ambiguities in a manner that makes operation of the program program easier and expands availability availability of the benefits,” said Lisa M. Starczewski, the co-chairwoman co-chairwoman of the Opportunity Zones Team at Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney. The draft regulation reassures investors that they will still qualify qualify for long-term tax benefits even if they invest in an area that loses its opportunity zone status in future future years. It gives them 30 months to begin improving any property they buy in a zone, a cushion that real estate developers developers were hoping for. “We see this as a positive sign for the success of the program over all, creating a structure that is both flexible enough to allow for businesses to thrive while also putting the right incentives in place to ensure that new capital flowing into these areas is actually actually put to work improving neighcompanied neighcompanied news stories shared by the group’s members, according according to the complaint. One story, originally posted by the conservative conservative news site World Net Daily, was titled “The 8 Dirtiest Scandals Scandals of Robert Mueller No One Is Talking About.” When instructing a group member to share the story on social media, an unnamed member of the Russian group urged colleagues to “emphasize that the work of this commission is damaging to the country and is aimed to declare impeachment of Trump,” according to the complaint. complaint. Much of the social media content content included in the complaint was fairly standard fodder for partisan Facebook pages. In 2017, a fake Facebook account called Bertha Malone was used by the Russians to post an image falsely claiming that former President Obama had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. More than one million people saw the account, according to the complaint. complaint. Another 2017 post, by a fake account account called Rachell Edison, was used to post an image about the National Rifle Association. The text accompanying the image read “I think next 4 years will be great for all Americans, and for gun lovers especially!” Any effect on the midterm elections elections is all but impossible to calculate. calculate. The disruption effort that prosecutors described went beyond beyond the United States, targeting elections and referendums in Ukraine and the European Union.

The draft regulations, which will be subject to 60 days of public comment and most likely completed completed next spring, would allow individuals, individuals, corporations and other types of businesses to invest in new opportunity funds. The funds could only be seeded by capital gains, such as the proceeds from selling a home or a share of stock at a profit. Ninety percent of a SAVES TAXPAYERS $70i.000 AS THEY All ARE BEING iEPORTED DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Russians used fake accounts to spread inflammatory posts, adopting viewpoints from across the political spectrum. January and June 2018 alone, prosecutors said, the project’s proposed operating budget totaled totaled more than $10 million. She routinely requested funds from Mr. Prigozhin’s companies. In one instance, she asked for 15 million rubles, or about $230,000, on Feb. 16, coincidentally the same day that Mr. Prigozhin and the other Russians were indicted. Ms. Khusyaynova’s responsibilities responsibilities also included more mundane tasks like paying salaries and renting office space. Prosecutors said that the Russians Russians tried to hide what they were doing, disguising payments as software support and developfund’s developfund’s investments must be in qualified opportunity zones. A business counts as being in an opportunity zone if 70 percent of its tangible property is there, the regulation says. In some cases, that can lead to a fund holding only 63 percent of its assets inside an opportunity zone. But Treasury Treasury officials called it a “pretty favorable favorable standard” for businesses. The exact percentage had been a point of contention in the Trump administration, as officials clashed in recent weeks over how flexible to make the regulation. Governors designated eligible ment from entities controlled by Mr. Prigozhin. Affiliates of his companies used 14 bank accounts to finance Project Lakhta. Friday’s announcement was the latest example of the Trump administration’s administration’s pledge to inform Americans of any foreign election meddling. The Justice Department Department had little reason otherwise to unseal the complaint; Ms. Khusyaynova lives in Russia, which does not have to extradite its citizens to the United States. Typically, the F.B.I. and Justice Department would keep the charges quiet and hope Ms. Khusyaynova might travel to a country where she could be decensus decensus tracts as opportunity zones earlier this year, choosing from a list of areas in their states that met the law’s criteria for investment investment starvation, and Treasury Treasury has approved those designations. designations.

The zones were an unheralded part of the tax law. But they have since attracted widespread interest. interest. Civic and state leaders have tained. “Exposing schemes to the public public is an important way to neutralize neutralize them,” the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, said in July. “The American people have a right to know if foreign governments governments are targeting them with propaganda.” Mr. Trump, who has been widely criticized for his reluctance to acknowledge and occasional outright dismissals of Moscow’s interference on his behalf, stressed on Friday that his administration administration had sought to protect elections, accusing the Obama administration administration of keeping quiet about the issue in 2016. “It had nothing to do with my campaign,” he told reporters while traveling in Arizona.

2061,2611760377,"Amazon's HQ2 Plan Gets Cool Reception TO THE EDITOR: Re ""Amazon Announces New York and Virginia as HQ2 Picks"" (nytimes.com, Nov. 13): The decision by Amazon to place its second headquarters in Arling ton, Va., and in Queens represents a blown opportunity to do some thing positive for the country. If it had chosen to place a second hub in one of the less stereotypically ""coastal elite"" options on its list (or split between two of them say, Columbus and Raleigh), Amazon could inject new energy, diversity and opportunity into regions suf fering the negative side effects of globalization. Jeff Bezos could single-handedly do much to reverse the consolida tion of America's urban profes sional class into a few cities, and thus begin to soothe some of the cultural divides. Placing a headquarters in the D.C. area will have a negative impact on American politics. Al though politics has always been dominated by the wealthy, sky rocketing real estate prices in Washington have increasingly blocked young idealists willing to work long hours for low salaries.

1178,2611728262,"In an Art Mecca, Chic Hots a Cost Adobe homes now mean high taxes even for those of modest means in Marfa, Tex. By SASHA VON OLDERSHAUSEN MARFA, TEX.-- Adobe is one of the oldest building materials known to humanity, especially in arid regions like the southwestern United States. The material-- earth, straw and water, pressed and sun-dried-- was always plentiful and, above all, dirt cheap. Here in Marfa, thanks to the vacation- home owners and retirees who have flocked to this artsy outpost in the West Texas desert, adobe also has become fashionable, a building material befitting the town's cool mix of culture and desert aesthetic. But for many of Marfa's longtime resi dents, the gentrification of the adobe home has made living in one rather expensive. Required by Texas law to find more reve nue, Presidio County tax assessors realized that adobe homes in Marfa were selling at a premium, and so they raised their appraisal values in 2017, just three years after a town- wide revaluation. That has meant two big tax increases, not only for owners of the high-end and expansive adobe homes with backyard pools, xeriscaped gardens and adobe walls to surround them, but also for hundreds of more modest, weather-beaten residences clustered around the south side of Marfa, where historically most of the town's Hispanic residents have lived. ""Why are you going to tax them for using the cheapest building material they could get?"" said Sam Martinez, 58, whose family owns an adobe home built in the 1800s and whose ties to Marfa are just as longstand ing. All over town, the tax authorities sank their hooks into adobe. A century-old two-bedroom partial adobe house with a metal roof and laminate floors, wedged between two much bigger homes on West Dallas Street, had its annual prop- CONTINUED ON PAGE C2 Thx increases for adobe homes in the artsy outpost of Marfa, Tex., have hit both upscale properties and more humble ones.

VASQUEZ FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES THE NEW YORK TIMES In a Texas Art Mecca, Chic Adobe Has a Cost CONTINUED FROM PAGE CI erty taxes rise to $3,003 today from $905 five years ago. In that same time, a renovat ed three-bedroom with a partly exposed adobe wall in its living room had its taxes go up to $4,988 from $1,365. Taxes on a wind-battered one-bedroom on the southeast edge of town, with a rust ing corrugated metal shed in its yard, rose to $1,953 from $319. For a tidy three-bed- room with a wood-burning fireplace, a de tached garage and a large yard, located north of the Marfa courthouse, the bill went to $4,469 from $1,848. Adobe homes make up about half of all residences in Marfa. Last year, owners of 448 of the 530 adobe homes in town 85 percent protested the increased apprais als. Some of them received adjustments, but not Maria Flores, a 57-year-old house cleaner. Her taxes rose to $1,050 this year, compared with $752 five years ago. The ap praisal board told her that because of im provements she'd made a fresh coat of paint and a new fence her tax would not be lowered. Originally a water stop along the Galve ston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, Marfa began as a sleepy ranching town that was de facto segregated well into the 1960s. Most of the existing adobe homes were south of the railroad tracks, and lacked plumbing and electricity. ""The Hispanics, in my time, all lived in lit tle adobe houses,"" said Rito Rivera, 78, who still lives in one. ""The Anglos were ranchers cowboys and landowners and they could afford better material."" The appraisal on Mr. Rivera's adobe house increased to $104,660 this year from $39,770 five years ago. He recently learned that he had prostate cancer, unlucky news that came with one upside: Under state law, it helped him qualify for a veteran's disabili ty exemption from his rising tax bill. But the bill for an adobe home his wife inherited in town spiked to $1,925 from $1,170 five years earlier. Fortunes changed for Marfa, and adobe, when the sculptor Donald Judd arrived in the 1970s and turned its empty expanses into something of a vast outdoor studio. Marfa came to signify something in the art world, people from far reaches traveled to the desert to see it, and the prices of things began to reflect the cities they came from. Marfa appears as you approach the blink ing traffic light at the intersection of two country roads. While it clings to the slow and deliberate pace of rural life, it retains the cosmopolitan sensibilities that arrived with Judd. Downtown, amid the handful of buildings that reflect Judd's legacy, are small gallery and studio spaces, restau rants, and adobe buildings stuccoed white and accented with neon signs. Marfa, with fewer than 2,000 full-time residents, doesn't have a mechanic but it has a public radio station, and the Marfa Book Company has an art section that ri vals niche bookstores in New York. It's a town that feeds on its pointed self-aware ness: a greasy spoon called Bad Hombres, owned by the town's justice of the peace; stop signs spray-painted to read ""Stop Talk ing."" The railroad tracks remain, and every couple of hours, the train comes crashing through with apocalyptic bravado. Judd, a proponent of preservation who died in 1994, liked adobe. When he pur chased what came to be called ""The Block"" a city block in Marfa he would turn into his home and personal collection of art, fur niture and artifacts he erected a 10-foot- high adobe wall around it. All of a sudden, humble adobe became cool. The classic Marfa adobe home was once a two-room structure made of dirt dug from a pit in the backyard. No longer. Adobe be came popular for three- or four-bedroom homes with observatories for stargazing and custom-tiled kitchens. And it wasn't just dirt anymore. Construction companies in the area, like Rainbow Adobe, specialize in homes made of cement-stabilized adobe to prevent erosion. Susan Kirr, a filmmaker, and her artist husband, Rusty Martin, who bought an ado be home in 2005 while they were still living in Austin, admired the soft, rounded shape the material made, its insulating properties and its relative affordability. Since they bought the house, their taxes have nearly quadrupled to $2,463 from $639. But until recently, even as Marfa's hous ing prices rose drastically, its appraisals for tax purposes did not. And since public schools rely on property tax revenue, Mar- fa's school district faced major penalties once the state comptroller got wind of the disparity between the appraised value of the houses and their market prices. After the county's 2014 action, property appraisals were still not close enough to market value to comply with Texas law, which requires them to fall between 95 and 105 percent of market value. To fix the prob lem, and increase tax revenue, the town cre ated a separate, higher appraisal classifica tion for adobe houses, an unusual move. The jump in value and taxes incited lower-income homeowners, who saw it as an unfair blunt-force tool. But Richard Petree, a consultant hired to help Marfa comply with the state law, said the new classifications were a reflection of what's been going on for years with adobe. ""It's a very unique market,"" he said. While adobe homes in Marfa are now yielding more tax dollars for Presidio County, the local schools can't expect any windfall. Despite the living conditions of many of its 350 schoolchildren, the Marfa district is considered ""rich"" by Texas stand ards because of the new tax revenue, and thus must refund more than $400,000 to the state for use in districts with less money. In many respects, even the hardest-hit homeowners recognize that Marfa's trans formation has paid dividends. Thanks to all those visitors and retirees, it has a thriving economy for a small town. According to the Census Bureau, its median household in come, $44,107, exceeds that of the nearest major city, El Paso, about 200 miles away, and is nearly double that of Presidio, a town 60 miles to the south, on the Mexican bor der. ""There's always something to do in Marfa,"" Mr. Martinez said. ""I'm grateful for that. Donald Judd brought money to Marfa."" Mr. Martinez once made adobe bricks while working on a construction project at the Capri, a bar and restaurant that serves craft cocktails and small plates. ""People used to joke, 'Sam is from Marfa, but now he can't even afford to live in it,""' Mr. Martinez said. But now, he said, it's true: His taxes have gone to $967 this year from $678 in 2016, and with $4,000 in back taxes due, he has put his family's three-bedroom home on the mar ket for $150,000. All over town, the tax authorities sank their hooks into adobe. 'The Hispanics, in my time, all lived in little adobe houses.

Brown’s new work for the 60th-anniversary season of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. By SASHA VON OLDERSHAUSEN marfa, tex. — Adobe is one of the oldest building materials known to humanity, especially especially in arid regions like the southwestern southwestern United States.

Ronald K. Brown creates a tribute to the choreographer who inspired him long ago. By MARINA HARSS The choreographer Ronald K. Brown stepped into a big studio at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and greeted the dancers with warm hugs. Then, almost without a word, he began to move, his feet and shoulders swaying to the beat, his upper upper body undulating slightly. “The Love,” a Malian song with a slow, hypnotizing groove, was playing on the sound system. The dancers gathered in a semicircle around him, moving to the rhythm. Just like that, they were drawn into the spirit of the dance. Mr. Brown was putting the finishing touches on “The Call,” which is to have its premiere on Tuesday as part of the Ailey company’s 60th-anniversary season. The dance, which he describes as “a love letter to Ailey,” is his seventh for the troupe in 20 years. So it’s no wonder the vibe in the studio studio is a bit like a conversation picked up midstream. “His movement just feels good,” the Ailey dancer Jacqueline Green said of Mr. Brown’s choreographic style, which combines combines the flow and rhythm of West African movement with an urban drive that suggests suggests club dance. (Mr. Brown also has his own ensemble, Evidence.) “It feels like I could do it at home,” Ms. Green continued. “I could do it when I’m out dancing. It’s almost almost like social dance.

115,2611705441,"Relocated Final Keeps Its Bitter Drama but Loses Some Edge RORY SMITH ON SOCCER MADRID --Pity Martinez, his legs like lead, took a deep breath. After 120 minutes of impossible tension, after a journey of 6,000 miles, after a game that had lasted a month, there was one more run to make. So he ran. Away from the last vestiges of resistance Boca Juniors could muster, away from all the turmoil and strife that had envel oped the final of the 2018 Copa Liberta- dores, and into the wide green expanse of Santiago Bernabeu, toward the un guarded goal, toward a place in eternity. Behind him, a sea of red and white bounced and broiled, urging him on, waiting for that moment of release, of certainty: for the third goal that would seal River Plate's 3-1 victory and, just as important, Boca's defeat and ensure that, for the fourth time in its history, River would be the South American champion. This one, though, will always mean the most Nothing else will ever really compare. How could it? It was all too perfect: beating Boca, its counterweight in the Great Schism that defines Argentine soc cer, its opposite pole in perhaps the fierc est rivalry in world sport; seizing the chance in that moment that Martinez rolled the ball into an empty net not only to savor its own ecstasy but to taste Boca's pain, each sensation feeding on the other, swirling, metastasizing. And to do it here, in Madrid, in Europe, this most intimate of hatreds turned, for one night, global, so that becoming cham pion of South America felt like conquering Europe. Long after the final whistle had blown, long after all but River's most ardent fans had left the Bernabeu, the team's captain, Leonardo Ponzio, placed the Libertadores trophy at the stadium's center circle and gathered his teammates around it They clasped hands, and they danced at the Continued on Page D7 River Plate players with the Copa Libertadores trophy on Sunday after their 3-1 victory over Boca Juniors in the final. The game was moved to Ma drid after River Plate fans attacked Boca Juniors' bus in Buenos Aires. THANASSIS STAVRAKIS/ASSOCIATED PRESS Relocated Final Has Bitter Drama, but Loses Some Edge From First Sports Page center of the soccer world. Their eyes did not leave the prize they had won. No, there will never be anything like this again. Perhaps that is for the best. As much as River will cherish it, treasure it, immortalize it in song, and as much as this felt like a significant moment for South American soccer proof that it retains the appeal to gather 62,000 people in one of Europe's great stadi ums at 10 days' notice this was as much a warning as a celebration. It should not be forgotten that this game was held here, and not in Ar gentina, because two weeks ago, the bus carrying Boca to River's Estadio Monumental was attacked by a handful of River fans, shattering its windows, sending shards of glass at Boca's play ers, exposing them to the acrid tang of pepper spray. Nor will it be, at least not while Boca Juniors have an appeal lodged with the Court of Arbitration for Sport that, if successful, would see River forced to forfeit the trophy, turning the most precious triumph in its history into the most bitter defeat. More than that, though, it was at the whim of Conmebol after twice pres suring the teams to play that same weekend that Argentina was stripped of the right to host the biggest game in its history, the game that had become known as the Final to End All Finals, against the wishes of the Argen tine government and both clubs. They did so, in part, because of Spain's large Argentine community, because of the frequent flights from Buenos Aires, and because they thought that only in Madrid and perhaps Miami, though that option never extended beyond fantasy could they stage the game safely while preserving so much of the flavor that makes Argentine soccer distinct But just as the act of observing some thing distorts it, so too does moving it Soccer any sport cannot be trans ported wholesale, airdropped some where else, and retain its true nature. It cannot be separated from its context and remain the same. Conmebol, the governing body for South American soccer, will regard this final, this opportunistic experiment, as a success. Fans had been flying into Madrid for days, not just from Ar gentina but from across Spain and the rest of Europe. On Friday night, thou sands of River fans gathered at Plaza Mayor, in the heart of the city, as a show of strength, a little piece of Ar gentina in Europe's cobbled squares. On Saturday morning just as they had in Buenos Aires the day the game was supposed to be played fans in the red and white of River and the blue and yellow of Boca strolled in the win ter sunshine at Plaza Mayor and at Puerta del Sol, mingling happily with the Christmas shoppers, with one an other. Madrid's unofficial economy had stirred itself for the influx. Outside the Bernabeu, fans could buy half-and-half scarves, that great symbol of the gen- trification of the game in Europe. Per haps through novelty, or plain old- fashioned bafflement, they were selling well. Downtown, the stores that usually make their money selling trinkets to tourists had rolled out passable fakes of Boca and River jerseys; they had offers on commemorative T-shirts and sweat shirts and hats. The flags, the colors, of Boca and River ran together. Spain's security services had taken every possible precaution, under the circumstances. The main drag of the Paseo de la Castellana, the eight-lane highway that skims the Bernabeu, was closed all day. An area to its north had been reserved for River fans; Boca's had a spot to the south. Each had stages for live music, vendors offering food and drink. The idea was that, once inside, the fans would have no reason to leave, no chance to mix. When they eventually headed to the stadium, they had to pass through three security checks. Spain was not a passive force in this; there was a reason Real Madrid had made the Bernabeu available, free of charge, when Conmebol's president, Alejandro Dominguez, had suggested playing the game in Madrid. Argentina, with Uruguay and Paraguay, wants to host the 2030 World Cup. So, too, does Spain, alongside Portugal and possibly Morocco. Hosting the game Aigentina could not manage offered a powerful parable. But it all seemed a little overbearing, as the fans wandered around the city together. Conmebol had the occasion it wanted, and one Argentina even at one remove deserved: a convivial atmosphere, one not marred by vio lence, and compelling to soccer's great and good. Lionel Messi was here, in one of the Bernabeu's executive boxes; so was Antoine Griezmann, in a Boca jersey, and much of the Juventus squad. It got the game it had hoped for, too: Boca taking an early lead on a brilliant breakaway goal from Dario Benedetto, and then River hitting back, no less stylishly, through Lucas Pratto. If the quality was a little absent, the drama was not Extra time loomed, the final to end all finals again becoming the final that would not end. Only when Juan Quintero curled home, expertly, from the edge of the box did daylight appear. By that stage, one Boca player had been sent off, and another removed through injury. It had just nine players. It could not resist And in the dying seconds, Martinez raced clear, his place in immortality waiting. And yet there was something miss ing. These were two Argentine teams, full of South American players, in front of a crowd of largely Argentine fans. It was not though, a purely Argentine game so much as a sanitized, defanged version, some of its soul left behind somewhere over the Atlantic. That is not entirely a bad thing. No stadium in Argentina can match the Bernabeu for modernity, for comfort; it is not always a negative to treat fans like customers, with the respect that entails, though it does tend to come at too much of a cost. The security opera tion, too, felt more respectful, smoother, less high strung. But nor is it an altogether good thing, a European lesson for the South Ameri cans to learn. Through one lens, this game was a warning for the future, the opening of a door to an era when UEFA, Conmebol's European counter part, feels at liberty to move its Cham pions League final outside Europe, if showpiece games are made available to the highest bidder. But through another, it is the comple tion of the past, of the gentrification of soccer that has also swept through Europe over the last 20 years and that has served to take an organic, authentic passion and repackage it in a way that is more palatable, more readily con sumable, more easily marketed. South America has not been immune to that, but it has managed to stave off its worst excesses. It has retained its passion and its color, what to European eyes looks like its authenticity the good; and, as those River fans on the corner of Avenida Monroe proved two weeks ago, it has kept the bad, too. But, just as in Europe, all of that exists only in its context It cannot be moved without being changed. In the Bernabeu, against the bright green of that perfect field, the colors seemed a little duller; in its steep stands, the noise was a little quieter. This was the Copa Libertadores, the Superclasico, but a doctored, Disney version: less exotic, more European; its tarnishes buffed, its edges smoothed. None of that will detract from River's victory. None of it will draw the elation from Martinez's moment. Nor will it worry Conmebol, not particularly; this, after all, is just what it had wanted, a polished finale to a month of chaos. South America, the Copa Libertadores, at last, has a champion. For River, there will never be another game like this. For the rest of us, though, there will. There will be many, many more. Remember the Neediest! It cannot be airdropped somewhere else and retain its true nature.

It was the culmination of a month of turmoil that began 6,000 miles away. Relocated Final Has Bitter Drama, but Loses Some Edge From First Sports Page center of the soccer world. Their eyes did not leave the prize they had won. No, there will never be anything like this again. Perhaps that is for the best. As much as River will cherish it, treasure it, immortalize it in song, and as much as this felt like a significant moment for South American soccer — proof that it retains the appeal to gather 62,000 people in one of Europe’s great stadiums stadiums at 10 days’ notice — this was as much a warning as a celebration. It should not be forgotten that this game was held here, and not in Argentina, Argentina, because two weeks ago, the bus carrying Boca to River’s Estadio Monumental was attacked by a handful of River fans, shattering its windows, sending shards of glass at Boca’s players, players, exposing them to the acrid tang of pepper spray. Nor will it be, at least not while Boca Juniors have an appeal lodged with the Court of Arbitration for Sport that, if successful, would see River forced to forfeit the trophy, turning the most precious triumph in its history into the most bitter defeat. More than that, though, it was at the whim of Conmebol — after twice pressuring pressuring the teams to play that same weekend — that Argentina was stripped of the right to host the biggest game in its history, the game that had become known as the Final to End All Finals, against the wishes of the Argentine Argentine government and both clubs. They did so, in part, because of Spain’s large Argentine community, because of the frequent flights from Buenos Aires, and because they thought that only in Madrid — and perhaps Miami, though that option never extended beyond fantasy — It cannot be airdropped somewhere else and retain its true nature. could they stage the game safely while preserving so much of the flavor that makes Argentine soccer distinct. But just as the act of observing something something distorts it, so too does moving it. Soccer — any sport — cannot be transported transported wholesale, airdropped somewhere somewhere else, and retain its true nature. It cannot be separated from its context and remain the same. Conmebol, the governing body for South American soccer, will regard this final, this opportunistic experiment, as a success. Fans had been flying into Madrid for days, not just from Argentina Argentina but from across Spain and the rest of Europe. On Friday night, thousands thousands of River fans gathered at Plaza Mayor, in the heart of the city, as a show of strength, a little piece of Argentina Argentina in Europe’s cobbled squares. On Saturday morning — just as they had in Buenos Aires the day the game was supposed to be played — fans in the red and white of River and the blue and yellow of Boca strolled in the winter winter sunshine at Plaza Mayor and at Puerta del Sol, mingling happily with the Christmas shoppers, with one another. another. Madrid’s unofficial economy had stirred itself for the influx. Outside the RAGGIO ALBERTO/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE — GETTY IMAGES Madrid deployed a significant police force, above, on Sunday for the game, which delivered the thrills fans had hoped for: Boca took an early lead, and then River hit back. Below, River players after the final, late goal from Martinez. Bernabeu, fans could buy half-and-half scarves, that great symbol of the gentrification gentrification of the game in Europe. Perhaps Perhaps through novelty, or plain oldfashioned oldfashioned bafflement, they were selling well. Downtown, the stores that usually make their money selling trinkets to tourists had rolled out passable fakes of Boca and River jerseys; they had offers on commemorative T-shirts and sweatshirts sweatshirts and hats. The flags, the colors, of Boca and River ran together. Spain’s security services had taken every possible precaution, under the circumstances. The main drag of the Paseo de la Castellana, the eight-lane highway that skims the Bernabeu, was closed all day. An area to its north had been reserved for River fans; Boca’s had a spot to the south. Each had stages for live music, vendors offering food and drink. The idea was that, once inside, the fans would have no reason to leave, no chance to mix. When they eventually headed to the stadium, they had to pass through three security checks. Spain was not a passive force in this; there was a reason Real Madrid had made the Bernabeu available, free of charge, when Conmebol’s president, •rtiwi JUAN CARLOS HIDALGO/EPA Alejandro Dominguez, had suggested playing the game in Madrid. Argentina, with Uruguay and Paraguay, wants to host the 2030 World Cup. So, too, does Spain, alongside Portugal and possibly Morocco. Hosting the game Argentina could not manage offered a powerful parable. But it all seemed a little overbearing, as the fans wandered around the city together. Conmebol had the occasion it wanted, and one Argentina — even at one remove — deserved: a convivial atmosphere, one not marred by violence, violence, and compelling to soccer’s great and good. Lionel Messi was here, in one of the Bernabeu’s executive boxes; so was Antoine Griezmann, in a Boca jersey, and much of the Juventus squad. It got the game it had hoped for, too: Boca taking an early lead on a brilliant breakaway goal from Dado Benedetto, and then River hitting back, no less stylishly, through Lucas Pratto. If the quality was a little absent, the drama was not. Extra time loomed, the final to end all finals again becoming the final that would not end. Only when Juan Quintero curled home, expertly, from the edge of the box did daylight appear. By that stage, one Boca player had been sent off, and another removed through injury. It had just nine players. It could not resist. And in the dying seconds, Martinez raced clear, his place in immortality waiting. And yet, there was something missing. missing. These were two Argentine teams, full of South American players, in front of a crowd of largely Argentine fans. It was not, though, a purely Argentine game so much as a sanitized, defanged version, some of its soul left behind somewhere over the Atlantic. That is not entirely a bad thing. No stadium in Argentina can match the Bernabeu for modernity, for comfort; it is not always a negative to treat fans like customers, with the respect that entails, though it does tend to come at too much of a cost. The security operation, operation, too, felt more respectful, smoother, less high strung. But nor is it an altogether good thing, a European lesson for the South Americans Americans to learn. Through one lens, this game was a warning for the future, the opening of a door to an era when UEFA, Conmebol’s European counterpart, counterpart, feels at liberty to move its Champions Champions League final outside Europe, if showpiece games are made available to the highest bidder. But through another, it is the completion completion of the past, of the gentrification of soccer that has also swept through Europe over the last 20 years and that has served to take an organic, authentic passion and repackage it in a way that is more palatable, more readily consumable, consumable, more easily marketed. South America has not been immune to that, but it has managed to stave off its worst excesses. It has retained its passion and its color, what to European eyes looks like its authenticity — the good; and, as those River fans on the corner of Avenida Monroe proved two weeks ago, it has kept the bad, too. But, just as in Europe, all of that exists only in its context. It cannot be moved without being changed. In the Bernabeu, against the bright green of that perfect field, the colors seemed a little duller; in its steep stands, the noise was a little quieter. This was the Copa Libertadores, the Superclasico, but a doctored, Disney version: less exotic, more European; its tarnishes buffed, its edges smoothed. None of that will detract from River’s victory. None of it will draw the elation from Martinez’s moment. Nor will it worry Conmebol, not particularly; this, after all, is just what it had wanted, a polished finale to a month of chaos. South America, the Copa Libertadores, at last, has a champion. For River, there will never be another game like this. For the rest of us, though, there will. There will be many, many more.

2833,2611789391,"Brooklyn Pastor Is Planning 2,100 Apartments on Church Lot By LUIS FERRE-SADURNI On Sundays, hundreds of cars squeeze into the 10-acre parking lot of a sprawling megachurch in East New York, Brooklyn, that caters to the largest evangelical congregation in the city. Other days, the expansive lot part blacktop, part gravel mostly sits empty in one of the poorest pockets of the city. For decades, the Rev. A. R. Bernard, the pastor of the Christian Cultural Cen ter, has had a vision for his underutilized parcel near Jamaica Bay to construct an urban village, as he calls it, of affordable housing, local shops and a performing arts center. That dream may finally come true. Mr. Bernard has partnered with the Gotham Organization, a real estate de veloper, to transform the land around the church into an all-encompassing campus of nine residential buildings with 2,100 units for very low to middle-income resi dents, as well as a school, a grocery store and on-site services for seniors. ""The mind-set in inner-city conditions is doing everything you can to get out and not come back,"" said Mr. Bernard, whose 43,000-member congregation makes the church, founded as a store front church in Williamsburg in 1978, a requisite stop for any politician on the campaign trail. ""Here you're talking about, 'Wow. I want to stay. I want to ex perience this community. There's a fu ture. There's hope.'"" The development would mark one of the most ambitious projects in an area of Brooklyn that has seen a spur in con struction. In 2016, a section of East New York was the first area to be rezoned un der Mayor Bill de Blasio's strategy to promote affordable housing and spark economic development in blighted neighborhoods. The rezoning plan faced fierce opposi tion from many residents who, pointing to nearby gentrified neighborhoods like Williamsburg, feared an influx of new residential buildings would invite wealthier newcomers, displace longtime residents and alter the character of the neighborhood. Since then, developers have flocked to East New York: It trails only Long Island City in the number of permits to build apartments that have been approved be tween July 2017 and July 2018. Most of the developments slated for construction are aligned with the city's policy to only finance buildings that are 100 percent affordable. But many resi dents fear it is only a matter of time be fore rents in East New York go up, entic ing developers to construct luxury build ings with market-rate units. The site next to the megachurch is about two miles south of the section that was rezoned two years ago. Mr. Bernard built his 96,000-square-foot church on land he bought in the 1990s from the for mer owners of the abutting property, Starrett City, the nation's largest federal ly subsidizeid apartment complex. The pastor, who has a master's degree in ur ban studies, has long been a vocal sup porter of preserving the affordability of the 5,581 apartments at the complex and was even immersed in a group that tried to buy it Mr. Bernard, a spiritual power broker who was the first religious leader to step down from President Trump's evangeli cal advisory board last year, said his new development would act as a bulwark against gentrification. Construction workers would be hired locally, much of the retail space would be reserved for lo cal entrepreneurs, and there were no tenants to displace, he said. ""The gentrification of Brooklyn is not the future,"" Mr. Bernard said. ""It's hap pening now, and I think that this is a very creative response to that reality."" The plans include curbless streets that lead to the heart of the complex, where the church, the school, a 299-seat theater and a community center surround a green quad similar to those on college campuses. The shops, on the ground- floor of the residential buildings, mostly face public avenues around the develop ment's perimeter. ""We need to rebuild an infrastructure of opportunity in this country,"" said Vishaan Chakrabarti, the founder of PAU, the company overseeing the de sign. ""All of the things that create social mobility, whether it's affordable housing, cultural institutions, health care, educa tion this project is about all of that That was very fundamental for us."" Construction would take place over a decade and would not begin until at least mid-2020. The project must go through the city's public review process, which includes feedback from the local commu nity board and approval of the City Coun cil. Reviews typically take six to eight months and show great deference to the local Council member's position. Councilwoman Inez Barron, whose district includes the church, said the plan was ambitious and had great potential. She initially raised concerns about the proposed heights of the buildings, which the developers modified: Most will be 13 to 15 stories high, lower than the towers of Starrett City. Ms. Barron's biggest point of con tention, however, is that the units might not be truly affordable to those who need them most The project would be a mix of income-based apartments for residents making 30 to 130 percent of the area's median income, or $28,170 to $122,070 for a three-person family in the New York City region. But Ms. Barron noted that the median household income in East New York, which has one of the largest proportions of homeless families, is significantly low: $34,512. And more than a third of families there might not qualify for an apartment because they fall below the 30 percent threshold and are considered ""extremely low-income."" ""I think that housing in East New York should be affordable to the people that live in East New York,"" Ms. Barron, a Democrat, said. ""We don't have a signifi cant amount of people that live at 130 percent of area median income."" And while many residents in the area said they supported the project, in no small part because of Mr. Bernard's stat ure in the community, others remained skeptical. ""How many more buildings do you need in this neighborhood? It brings in too many people,"" said Daniel Sedney, 59, who lives in East New York and was vis iting his mother in Starrett City on Sun day. He added, ""Affordable housing has turnedouttobealotof garbage. Alot of it is for middle-income people,"" said Mr. Sedney, who said he had unsuccessfully applied for an affordable unit on multiple occasions. Mr. Bernard, citing the deterioration of public housing in New York City as an ex ample, argued that mixed-income build ings, in which units with higher rents help subsidize the lower-rent units, were one of the few viable ways of creating a sustainable model of housing. ""We cannot warehouse one income level,"" Mr. Bernard said. ""The only way that we can change the community and respond to the gentrification of Brooklyn is to have a mixture of income in our com munities. We have to create an envi ronment where a manufacturing worker can live down the hall from a doctor and lawyer, or some other individual who is a professional. Bryan Kelly, the executive vice presi dent at the Gotham Organization, said it was too early to determine how many units would be set aside for each income band. But he noted that, under a city law passed in 2016, more than 30 percent of the units built would remain perma nently and deeply affordable for tenants in the lowest income bands. All of the units would be rent-stabilized. ""If we can adapt in any way, we will, Mr. Kelly said. Andre T. Mitchell, the chairman of Community Board 5 in Brooklyn, said he was grateful the developers met with him early in the process and was im pressed by the aspects of the plan that addressed social ills. Like Ms. Barron, he said ensuring affordability was a priority ""to make sure that it's a win-win for ev erybody."" ""As a board, we understand that East New York is the new ground zero of all these new developments,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""There is still a lot of apprehension in the community. Often, we hear one thing and it's something else that's done. Developers have also played Three-card Monte with us, and often times they don't come through."" He added, ""We have to make sure that promises made are kept"" 'The gentrification of Brooklyn is not the future. It's happening now.' The Rev. A. R. Bernard, pastor of the Christian Cultural Center When the Rev. A. R. Bernard, the pastor of the Christian Cultural Center, looks at this 10-acre parking lot in East New York, Brooklyn, he sees an opportunity to construct what he calls an urban village.

2584,2748022449,"Luis Garden Acosta, Founder of Program To Help Brooklyn Community, Dies at 73 By SAM ROBERTS 3Luis Garden Acosta, who stopped just short of becoming a priest and then a medical doctor and instead organized an innovative program to restore the spirit and health of his community, died on Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 73. His wife, Frances Lucerna, said the cause was degenerative lung disease. Mr. Garden Acosta and Ms. Lu cerna founded a community orga nization, El Puente (the Bridge), in 1982 with the goal of combating gang violence among teenagers in Williamsburg, in northwest Brooklyn, which was then a mostly poverty-stricken neigh borhood where Hispanic and Ha- sidic Jewish residents competed for scarce housing. El Puente evolved into a grass roots model for improving local health, education, and envi ronmental and social services and engaging residents in political, hu man rights and social justice cam paigns and cultural projects. ""When I started El Puente, I felt like a bridge between my col leagues on the left, who would never be caught dead in church, and progressive Christians,"" Mr. Garden Acosta told The New York Times in 2009. I wanted to create a 'bridge.' Mr. Garden Acosta, Ms. Lu cerna and Eugenio Maldonado convened clergy, educators, com munity leaders, health providers and artists around the mission of the Young Lords Party, a radical Puerto Rican group, and of the Young Christian Workers Move ment, which was founded to unite the Roman Catholic Church and organized labor with a common agenda. Mr. Garden Acosta became the president of El Puente; Ms. Lu cerna, executive director; and Mr. Maldonado, chief of operations. The organization established an alternative public high school, El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice, with Ms. Lucerna as its di rector; founded a Green Light District to ameliorate the more re cent gentrification of Williams burg's predominantly Hispanic South Side section, which many residents call Los Sures, by pro moting arts and culture and re serving open space for residents; and joined with the United Jewish Organization and other groups to establish a local Community Alli ance for the Environment, which successfully lobbied against a pro posed city incinerator nearby. ""I can remember walking through the shell of an empty church in Los Sures with Luis,"" Martin Espada, a poet (and a Pul itzer Prize finalist in 2007) who has taught at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, recalled in an email. ""He spread his arms and told me about everything that would happen in this empty space,"" Pro fessor Espada added, mentioning classes in English as a second lan guage and karate. ""I thought he was crazy. It became El Puente."" More recently, El Puente creat ed the Latino Gimate Action Net work in Puerto Rico to ""reclaim and restore the environmenL"" El Puente has won numerous awards for community building and youth development Still, the group's Academy for Peace and J ustice has come under some criticism. ""El Puente's teachers and ad ministrators are clearly well- meaning,"" the lawyer and com mentator Heather Mac Donald wrote in 1998 in City Journal, pub lished by the conservative Man hattan Institute. But she found fault with its curriculum, which of fered, she wrote, ""courses in ghetto culture of which Hip- Hop 101 is an extreme example that reinforce the parochialism of inner-city kids rather than open their minds to broader intellectual worlds."" This week. Representative Ny- dia Velazquez, Democrat of New York, described Mr. Garden Acosta on TWitter as ""a strong ad vocate of civil rights, education, our youth and the importance of advocating"" for measures to counter climate change. Luis Patrick Garden Acosla was born on March 17, 1945, in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. His father, Luis A. Garden, was Dominican. His mother, Maximina Garden Acosta, was born in Puerto Rico. She became a social activist her self after a fiance was killed in a police massacre of peaceful Puerto Rican nationalist marchers in Ponce in 1937. She lat er helped smuggle undocumented immigrants from the Dominican Republic to New York, where she found them jobs in the factory where she worked. One of Mr. Garden Acosta's first encounters with racism was when he was 9. Accompanying a black friend visiting the friend's grand mother in Virginia, Luis was thrilled to discover that a science fiction film they had missed in Brooklyn was playing at a local theater. The friend warned him away, however, because the the ater was racially segregated. ""How could it be true that I was brown and couldn't go some where?"" he said in an interview with The Daily News in New York in 1999. ""I was so hurt. I can still feel it. I was angry. I was sad. Something pierced my soul."" When he was 15 he enrolled in St. Mary's College, a seminary in North East, Pa., with the goal of becoming a priest; he later earned his college degree there. (The college is now the North East campus of Mercyhurst Uni versity.) During subsequent silent re treats, Mr. Garden Acosta re called, he was troubled when he learned that the seminary's Re- demptorist order had acquiesced in running segregated parochial schools in the South. He said he was inspired to pursue social ad vocacy when he heard the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on televi sion. 1 1 was as though he was speak ing to me,"" Mr. Garden Acosta said. Every word he was speak ing was embedded in my soul."" He returned to Brooklyn with out having taken his vows, en listed in anti-Vietnam War pro tests and the Catholic Worker Movement and, in 1969, joined the Young Lords Party, whose mem bers had been arrested after they commandeered an East Harlem church to distribute food and clothing to the poor. Mr. Garden Acosta was a com munity organizer for the city un der Mayor John V. Lindsay's ad ministration in the late 1960s; en rolled in Harvard Medical School in 1970 and attended it for several years; worked as a drug counsel or in Amherst; and presented a ra dio program on health in Massa chusetts.

After returning to Brooklyn from Massachusetts in 1980, he became the director of community medicine at the municipally owned Greenpoint Hospital, where in the emergency room, he recalled, ""the young people would come, mostly dead on arrival."" ""One weekend I decided to fig ure out if there was some way we could save their lives,"" Mr. Garden Acosta added, in the Times inter view. ""And you know, as God would have it, it was maybe a half an hour into my weekend when a young woman was brought in, 19 going on 20. Her name was Sugar. They tried to resuscitate her.""

124,2210586592,"MICHAEL K1MMELMAN I CRITIC’S NOTEBOOK SIMON MENGES A British Solution to New Yorks Housing Problem CONTINUED FROM PAGE Cl It also matters that Hackney has a young, design-conscious mayor, Philip Glanville. He and his district colleagues have enlisted a London firm, Karakusevic Carson Architects, Architects, known for working closely, and well, with council residents. Its goal: producing homes that these tenants desire, in newly mixed-income neighborhoods where everyone everyone reaps the benefits. I visited a couple of estates in Hackney — one named Colville, the other, Kings Crescent Crescent — both in the midst of transformation. It will be some time before they’re finished, but the results so far look good. They’re in different parts of the district. Colville Estate, Estate, from the 1950s, is in an area of Hackney that has been changing. The estate is wedged between a canal that has become home to a variety of upscale restaurants and fashion studios, and a park that remains remains surrounded by council housing estates. estates. Where Colville abuts the park, two new apartment towers replace a parking lot and a smaller, dilapidated estate housing block that was demolished some years ago. Austere Austere and vaguely Brutalist, at 16 and 20 stories the new towers are clad in handmade handmade water-struck Belgian bricks, one tower red, the other a smoky gray (the darker color a result of firing the same bricks another time). The towers, for which Karakusevic Carson Carson partnered with the distinguished London-based London-based firm David Chipperfield Architects, Architects, have their own name, Hoxton Press. Hoxton Press is an all-market-rate development. development. The old Colville consisted of some 430 subsidized apartments in aging, inward-turning inward-turning housing blocks on narrow streets. All of those old buildings are now coming down. Those 430-odd apartments are being replaced by 925 new apartments, in phases, in the coming years. The new apartments built so far occupy a midrise complex of mixed-income, red-brick buildings buildings around a network of playful, richly detailed detailed open spaces. Hoxton Press, which PETER LANDERS Top, a wraparound balcony at Hackney’s new luxury apartment towers Hoxton Press, above. Above right, a landscaped courtyard in Branch Place, part of Colville Estate. Below, an apartment in Kings Crescent Estate. SIMON MENGES acts as a signpost and gateway to the new Colville Estate, is the only all-market-rate part of the project. All in all, the Colville makeover produces more subsidized units than before, including including apartments for middle-income tenants. The estate will become roughly half market-rate, market-rate, half subsidized. Construction is being being done in phases to prevent displacement. Every resident of the old Colville who chose to remain on the estate has been guaranteed guaranteed a new, better home. A similar makeover by Karakusevic Carson, Carson, working with HHBR Architects, is refashioning refashioning Kings Crescent Estate, from the 1970s, in a different part of Hackney. There, changes involve renovations to older, existing existing buildings as well as the construction of PE1ER LANDERS sleek new midrise gray-brick apartment blocks that fill in stretches of long-vacant land where poorly maintained council towers towers were demolished in the early 2000s. More than 100 older apartments are now fitted out with features residents requested, like winter gardens and balconies. Another 170 will be refurbished soon and 200 more apartments built. New and old buildings have been seamlessly integrated. Together they define new courtyard blocks along a grid of streets and open spaces that weave Kings Crescent into the surrounding neighborhood. neighborhood. Subsidized and market-rate tenants at Kings Crescent share entrances, floors, apartment layouts and open spaces. There are no so-called poor doors to distinguish entrances for different incomes. Subsidized tenants bought into the scheme because it delivered obvious benefits. Market-rate residents bought into it because it gave them first-rate apartments in a rapidly gentrifying gentrifying neighborhood. Materials are high quality, units light-filled, the brick architecture architecture substantial, dignified, well proportioned, proportioned, simple and modern. How did Hackney pull all this off? Back in the 1980s, under Margaret Thatcher, the British government (like Ronald Ronald Reagan’s administration in the United States) wanted to get out of public housing. It offered council housing tenants an opportunity opportunity to buy their apartments, and turned management of estate properties over to independent independent housing associations. In retrospect, the offer of ownership seems a fairly progressive idea. But it ended up reducing the number of subsidized subsidized units at the same time council housing services were declining and units weren’t being built by the government to replace the ones being bought out. London’s public housing stock inevitably declined and shrank. Skip ahead to 2007. Gordon Brown’s Labour Labour Party came to power. A new regulation was passed. Now district councils, on their own, were permitted to borrow large enough sums to build or renovate council projects without having to partner with private private developers, as had been the case before. before. The global market collapse obscured the rule’s effect for a while. But Hackney and other local districts saw its implications. implications. In 2010, the Hackney Council enlisted Karakusevic Carson. Hackney was then one of the few London districts that had not, over the years, jettisoned its staff of inhouse inhouse urban planners. Architects and council council leaders in conversation with residents began to imagine upgrading various underserved underserved sites. The accelerating gentrification gentrification of East London meant rising land values values in Hackney. Those land values underpinned underpinned the loans that would help pay for improvements. improvements. In its waning months, the Bloomberg administration administration in New York floated a proposal to erect market-rate towers on select Nycha properties, as a way of bridging the authority’s authority’s fiscal gaps. Residents went ballistic. But the approach was entirely unlike Hackney’s. Hackney’s. There was next to no community engagement engagement or serious planning or specific promises upfront about what benefits tenants tenants would reap. The developers would be private. Here in Hackney the process hasn’t made everyone happy, but the majority of tenants got what they wanted: new or renovated apartments, homes with gardens and terraces, terraces, buildings that felt solid and were made of brick, not concrete or glass. They wanted to remain together, as communities. And they wanted to live in low- and midrise blocks, between three and 12 stories, not skyscrapers. Towers, for poor tenants, conjured failed public housing projects of the 1960s and ’70s. For wealthy residents, towers provide lofty views from which to look down on neighbors. Navigating Navigating the conflicting semiotics, Hoxton Press, at Colville, with its involvement by Chipperfield, Chipperfield, wears its luxury lightly. Its exceptionalism is expressed in subtle ways, via the eloquent craft of the brickwork, brickwork, the depth of windowsills, the quality of light in apartments and geometric arrangement arrangement of wraparound balconies that turn the buildings’ envelopes into stacked bands, like thick, hexagon-shaped pancakes, pancakes, poised above elegantly vaulted lobbies lobbies sheathed in clear glass. Those hexagons were conceived to be good neighbors — letting sunlight more easily reach the adjacent midrise buildings on the estate. Hoxton Press also shares with the rest of Colville a material language and open space. Cobbled granite floors run from inside the tower lobbies across a sculpted plaza to the midrise buildings. Some of the subsidized apartments I saw in those midrise buildings were bigger and hardly less luxurious than the ones I toured in Hoxton Hoxton Press. Two first-rate London landscape firms, Muf and Vogt, handled the intricate design of the courts, gardens, paths and other public public areas at both Colville and Kings Crescent. Crescent. Mayor Glanville and his colleagues on the Hackney Council deserve credit here. They proceeded from a bedrock belief that good design and humane urban planning are basic rights, not privileges for the rich. New York doesn’t do urban planning. Its political leadership doesn’t seem to care much about design or its social impact. The gamble at Colville and Kings Crescent is that, step by step, engaged architects and a local government, jointly working on behalf of vulnerable residents, can turn public housing around and manage gentrification. We’ll see how these mixed-income communities communities in Hackney evolve.

378,2748053317,"An Artist Finally Gets His Shrine MARTHA SCHWENDENER Basquiat on the disparity of wealth, all inside a rich space. A FEW YEARS AGO, a plaza in Paris was named after the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, the Brooklyn-born painter who became a global sensation in the early 1980s and died at 27 of a heroin overdose. No similar honor has been bestowed upon Basquiat by the City of New York. However, the opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study... ter in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine. The Brant in Manhattan is also part of a wave of private museums opening across the country, including the Hill Art Foundation in Chelsea; the expansion of Glenstone in Maryland; and the Marciano and Broad collections in Los Angeles. But first, Basquiat. The story of this painter of Haitian and Puerto-Rican de scent is one of the most documented in con temporary art history. Basquiat moved to Manhattan partly to escape his strict ac- CONTINUED ON PAGE C2 /pj Jean-Michel Basquiat ojjje* Brant Foundation PICK ART REVIEW Detail of ""Untitled (Self Portrait),"" 1982.

He sprayed poetic, enigmatic graffiti on walls in downtown Manhattan before moving to canvas and starred in an independent Film, ""Downtown 81."" He dated Madonna before she was famous and made paintings with his hero-turned-friend, Andy Warhol. Basquiat was also part of a group of Neo- Expressionists that were largely rejected by critics interested in photography, video and conceptual art but embraced by a popular audience and a surging art market, where he often felt treated like a faux-primi- tive genius, which he found racist and de meaning. And yet, this seemed to fuel his work and the anger in it toward great er heights, forging a brand of African-Amer ican history painting that addressed every thing from cultural Figures to black police men. His reputation has grown posthu mously and in 2017 one of his paintings sold at auction for a record S110.5 million to a Japanese billionaire. The show at the Brant Foundation, orga nized with the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, where more than half of the works here were recently on view, fairly repre sents Basquiat's contribution. He concen trated on the human Figure and many of the works are grouped for heightened effect. One room is dedicated to paintings of box ers Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Louis, and Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) while another features loosely drawn heads and skulls. And yes, the SI 10.5 million paint ing is in the building: a ferocious ""Untitled"" (11)82) skull made with black and colored spray paint and oilstick against a banal blue background. Other paintings pay homage to jazz greats like Miles Davis and Charlie Parker (Basquiat worked in a similarly improvisa tory way) and handwritten text appears ev erywhere. Basquiat favored the cutup tech nique of the Beat writer William Burroughs but he also witnessed the rise of rap and hip- hop music. His words feel eerily poignant today: ""debt shrine,"" ""per capita,"" ""Hoo- verville,"" ""perishable,"" ""black teeth,"" ""im mortality."" Others relate to histories from the Roman Empire to ""Grillo"" (1984), which mentions sugar and the West Indies and sports heavy nails like those driven into minkisi power Figures in Africa to cast spells or seal contracts. Crossed-out words also recur in his paintings and are weirdly reminiscent of the bracketing or slashing of text in deconstructionist philosophy, to em phasize the cultural and biased nature of language. Funny to realize in retrospect that Basquiat and the French philosopher Jacques Derrida were on the same page. Notable works include ""Unbreakable"" (1987), a late painting in which the human figure is mostly banished the work has never been shown in New York. The wry ""Hollywood Africans"" (1983), on loan from the Whitney Museum, includes text like ""gangsterism,"" ""tax free,"" ""200 yen"" and ""sugar cane, inc.,"" linking up creativity, race and corruption. A dramatic salon-style wall on the second floor includes a grid of 16 paintings from 1982, on wooden supports constructed by Basquiat's studio assistant. So why open the Manhattan branch of the Brant with Basquiat? Peter M. Brant, a newsprint tycoon, was an early collector and the East Village was Basquiat's old stamping grounds. The new Brant, an ur ban outpost of the Greenwich, Conn., insti tution, is in a former Con Edison power sub station lavishly remodeled by the architects Gluckman Tang which was also, for several decades, the home and studio of the artist Walter De Maria, who was best known for ""The Lightning Field"" (1977) in the New Mexico desert. Gluckman Tang has preserved the ""bones"" of the building sturdy beige brick walls and sleek industrial staircases and opened up rear-facing walls with windows that provide light and spectacular views of the neighborhood. The building includes four floors of exhibition space and a rooftop garden with a reflecting pool visible as a glittering skylight on the fourth floor. Nestled among old tenement buildings, the location feels very similar to Lafayette An ticipations in Paris, a new multistory foun dation related to the nearby department store. Both institutions serve as emblems of the gentrification of former working- class neighborhoods, but also the proliferation of a new kind of museum. Private collections have long histories for instance, the Frick and the Morgan in New York but also, at present, carry a double-edged meaning and purpose: They are private exhibition venues but also tax havens for the very rich. Mr. Brant was on the forefront of this phenomenon both the private institution showcasing contempo rary art and trouble with the l.R.S. when his foundation opened a decade ago across the street from his estate in Greenwich. One of the arguments in support of the East Village space is that it offers free ad mission to see works that are rarely on view although you have to make reservations, which are quickly becoming scarce. And the ""free"" admission to most of these private museums is the ultimate hidden-fee-econ omy tactic: We are all paying, in a variety of ways, to live in a system that supports co lossal disparities of wealth. Museum admis sion might be free, but health care isn't Basquiat's work speaks to these issues, but somewhat in code. It's an old story: the black artist (or musician) who makes raw, personal work and sells it to a rich white person. There is something that feels al most not right about looking too long at a Basquiat because it's like looking into an open wound. He didn't go to art school (ex cept for a few life-drawing classes) to learn this because it's way beyond art, which is the best kind of art But the words in Basquiat's paintings often point to what it's like to be turned into a masterpiece, a Finan cial instrument, and a trophy. The show at the Brant doesn't wade di rectly into this but the Guggenheim will, in an exhibition opening in June that focuses on the response of visual artists, including Basquiat, to the death of M ichael Stewart, a graffiti artist who lapsed into a coma while in the custody of transit ofFicers in 1983. (The ofFicers were acquitted by a jury). ""It could've been me,"" Basquiat said. Instead, Basquiat continued on, living a bifurcated life in which his work was highly valued but his existence, he even stated, was not. 1 stopped trekking up to the Brant Foun dation in Greenwich because the program there didn't reflect the art I wanted to en gage with. It was overwhelmingly male, white and approached through the triumph of the market what's hot and expensive rather than a more critical prism. The cur rent show presents Basquiat in a gorgeous, former-industrial space but there are al ready dozens of fantastic, adventurous and experimental spaces in the area. Perhaps one way private and public mu seums can work together is this: Private ones offer more opportunities to see work that has been highly (or over) valued, while public institutions do the difficult, scholarly work we expect. How the Brant will coexist with this con text remains to be seen. It's great to see Basquiat in the East Village although, with its new condominiums, steep rents, and expensive restaurants, it barely resem bles the neighborhood he inhabited 40 years ago. This exhibition will bring joy to a lot of people. The questions and complica tions it contains will reach far beyond Sixth Street and the art world. jV| Jean-Michel Basquiat ootJc, Through May 15 at the Brant rM:* Foundation, Manhattan; 2 12-777-2297, brantfoundation.org.

2694,2218411949,"For Art of a Perpetual Top Bidder, a New Auction Christies will sell the collection of S.I. Newhouse Jr., the publisher who died in 2017. By TED LOOS In the salad days of his art collecting, back in the 1960s, the magazine publisher S. I. Newhouse Jr. started out modestly, at one point paying the dealer Betty Parsons on an installment plan. His purchasing ramped up quickly from there, and Newhouse, the Conde Nast owner who died in 2017 at 89, eventually used his billions to amass a large collection of blue-chip modern and contemporary art. ?He had the best eye and the best collection collection of postwar paintings ever put together,? together,? said his friend David Geffen, the entertainment entertainment mogul, who added, ?I bought a lot of it.? Newhouse?s willingness to part with wellknown wellknown works by the likes of Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning for the right price illustrates that he was never overly sentimental sentimental about his trove. Si, as he was known, was always happy to trade up or cash out. Now his family is following suit, selling 11 big-ticket works at Christie?s New York, spread over two evening sales in May. The auction house estimates that the group is worth some $130 million. (In November, the family sold a Francis Bacon work, ?Study of Henrietta Moraes Laughing,? which brought $21.7 million at Christie?s in Manhattan.) Manhattan.) The strength of the lineup is reflected in the fact that a choice Cezanne still life in the bunch ? ?Bouilloire et Fruits? (?Pitcher and Fruit?) from 1888-90, estimated at $40 million ? is considered only the secondmost secondmost valuable of the works. It goes up for bid May 13 at the Impressionist and Modern sale. The marquee Newhouse lot is Jeff Koons?s sculpture ?Rabbit? (1986), estimated estimated to fetch between $50 million and $70 million million when it is offered May 15 at the Postwar and Contemporary auction. The shiny metallic metallic bunny is one of only four in existence, and the last in private hands. If it meets the house?s expectations, it could surpass the highest price paid for a Koons at auction, $58.4 million for ?Balloon Dog (Orange)? (1994-2000), sold at Christie?s New York in 2013. ?I?m a firm believer that we will have a record for Koons,? said Alex Rotter, the chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Christie?s, which is sending a selection of the Newhouse works on tour, beginning this week in Asia to coincide with Art Basel Hong Kong. Rounding out the top Newhouse lots are Vincent van Gogh?s ?Trees in the Garden of the Asylum? (1889), estimated around $25 million; Roy Lichtenstein?s ?Landscape with Boats? (1996), $7 million to $9 million; Andy Warhol?s ?Little Electric Chair? (196465), (196465), $6 million to $8 million; and Lucian Freud?s ?Painter?s Garden? (2003), $4 million million to $6 million.

Conditions,? at Team Gallery ? demonstrates demonstrates that it is well deserved. His work appears on the cover of Artforum?s March issue and will be included in the 2019 Whitney Biennial. Mr. Sepuya is not an overnight sensation, however; over a decade decade of working, exhibiting and returning to art school to study with the great photographer Catherine Opie at the University of California, Los Angeles, helped him to arrive at a distinctive and timely amalgam of portraiture and conceptual photography. Mr. Sepuya?s photographs are like visual puzzles. He appears in many of them, but in fragmented form and usually with a camera in hand. Some of the works show multiple hands holding cameras, suggesting that authorship is always some sort of collaboration. Pushing that out further, you the viewer are reflected against the dark backdrops in the picture. And if you photograph Mr. Sepuya?s works (as I of course did), your hand and camera end up nestled surprisingly amid the gesturing fingers of him and his subjects. ?The Conditions? could refer to lighting, studio setups or social conditions. Mr. Sepuya?s photographs photographs have often been categorized categorized as queer, but they feel more universal to me: Multifarious shades of melanin are represented, represented, and he has included images images of women in this show. And while the history of representing bodies in photography ? particularly particularly nude ones ? is fraught, Mr. Sepuya charges intrepidly into the mire, offering what feel like new, smart conclusions on how to represent power or vulnerability, as well as the unwavering desire to look at such images.

He noted that the collection was hardly being depleted by the sale. ?They?re selling a fraction of the collection, collection, and Victoria is still buying,? Mr. Meyer said, referring to Newhouse?s widow. Newhouse was something of a legend on the auction scene. When he wasn?t overseeing overseeing a magazine empire that included Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Vogue and many other publications, he was frequently on the hunt for art, usually bidding by phone. ?Si said to me that he always gets what he wants because he will not stop bidding,? Mr. Geffen recalled. ?We competed for a number number of pictures, and he always won.? The friendship did yield some benefits for Mr. Geffen, who called Newhouse a mentor. He said that he bought some 20 artworks from Mr. Newhouse over the years, including including paintings by Lichtenstein and de Kooning. Kooning. Another work that made its way to Mr. Geffen?s collection was Mr. Johns?s ?False Start? (1959), which Newhouse bought for $17 million at Sotheby?s in 1988, then a high for a living artist.

3245,2754973986,"A Mogul Is Poised to Lead Los Angeles, but the City Isn't So Sure By TIM ARANGO MONTECITO, Calif.-- Rick J. Caruso was getting excited. In a few weeks, the real estate mogul's beachside resort in Montecito would open its doors, and the project, more so than his others in Los Angeles, was a personal one. The family crest is etched above... the outdoor fireplace. The booths in one of the restaurants are in spired by Perino's, a long-shut- tered Hollywood eatery where Mr. Caruso hung out. The sundries shop is run by his friend Gwyneth Paltrow. ""Periwinkle is the color Gwyn eth wanted,"" he said. The property, called the Mira- mar, opened in February and is his first hotel. It is vintage Caruso: Nostalgic and shiny, and like his multimillion-dollar developments in Los Angeles, every detail has been obsessed over. It builds on his earlier successes. The Pal isades Village, a small-scale shop ping center modeled in part on Nantucket, opened in October. The Grove, a retail enclave that opened in 2002, counts a number of annual visitors on par with Dis neyland. As the chairman of the board of trustees at the University of Southern California, Mr. Caruso has also taken on a role of promi nence as the university struggles to handle a series of scandals. These are the latest signs that Mr. Caruso seems intent on broad ening his stamp on the city of Los Angeles, where he is a figure of in creasing influence. At 60, he seems poised to take a greater role in the city's affairs, at a time when older leaders, like Eli Broad, the octogenarian-billion aire arts patron, are stepping back. Now eyes are on Mr. Caruso who has said he might run for mayor and a handful of others to see where they will try to take the city in the next several years. His rise to prominence has been welcomed by his peers, but it has also raised questions for many in Los Angeles about who should take on the mantle of benefactor, power broker and possible politi cal leader for an increasingly di verse city where inequality is visi ble everywhere. In addition to Mr. Caruso, oth ers in the city seen as filling the gap left by Mr. Broad and others of his ilk are Austin Beutner, a phi lanthropist and superintendent of Los Angeles schools; Magic John son, with his investment company and philanthropy work; Casey Wasserman, an entertainment ex ecutive who led efforts to bring the Olympics to Los Angeles in 2028; and Antonia Hernandez, who as president of the California Community Foundation funnels a large amount of philanthropy to ward immigration and housing programs. Notably absent are Hollywood moguls, like the billionaire David Geffen, who have historically sup ported the arts but shied away from involvement in broader civic affairs. ""I wish there were more people who took a leadership role in civic activities,"" said Mr. Caruso, who added that he would be hard pressed to put together a dinner party of civic leaders if he wanted to rally support for a big initiative. ""We don't have that long list of go to people to get things done that we used to have."" Part of the reason that wide spread civic engagement is diffi cult in Los Angeles is because the city can feel so fragmented. This was highlighted with the recent killing of the rapper Nipsey Hus- sle, whose death was felt deeply in his black and Latino South Los Angeles neighborhood, even as many in other mostly white sec tions had barely heard of him. Mike Feuer, the Los Angeles city attorney, who has known Mr. Caruso for years, said, ""There was historically an echelon of L.A. leaders with a very deep stake in the future of the city and a pas sion, a sense of philanthropy, peo ple who were civicaliy engaged."" He added Eli is of that genera tion. But there are very few people like that anymore in Los Angeles."" Mr. Caruso, he believes, is one of them. Mr. Caruso's curated worlds, though, are a world away from the concerns of everyday citizens of Los Angeles, and many dismiss the idea that a multibiltionaire de veloper should take on a bigger leadership role. His real estate career hasn't been without controversy. In 2016, he had to walk away from plans for a retail development on a la goon near the coast in Carlsbad amid opposition from the commu nity. Mr. Caruso spent millions to fund a ballot initiative to bypass state environmental planning laws, but a citizen-backed meas ure opposing the development eventually prevailed. Were he to pursue a serious run for mayor, it would raise numer ous conflicts of interest, given City Hall's role in approving develop ment deals, and he would most likely have to step away from his businesses. The grandson of Italian immi grants, Mr. Caruso grew up in Beverly Hills. His father started Dollar Rent A Car. He worked as a lawyer before getting into real es tate by buying property and leas ing it to his father's business. That began his rise as a developer, with periodic forays into public life, with the city's Department of Wa ter and Power in the 1980s and lat er as president of the Police Com mission. He eventually amassed a fortune of $4 billion, good for No. 504 on Forbes's billionaires list. Then last year, he was thrust again into the spotlight as chair man of U.S.C.'s board of trustees at a time when the university had been thrown into crisis. After decades in which U.S.C. leaders had worked to transform it into a world-class institution, the university, Los Angeles Coun ty's largest private employer, was waylaid by several scandals. It has been at the center of the Jus tice Department's investigation into the college admissions scam. And last year, a Los Angeles Times investigation revealed ac cusations that a former gynecolo gist at the university had sexually abused students for years. This came on the heels of the medical school dean's being ousted after allegations of drug use and prosti tution. Last summer, Mr. Caruso be came chairman of the board and installed Wanda Austin, a former aerospace executive, as interim president, forcing out C. L. Max Nikias, who still had many loy alists on the board who opposed Mr. Caruso's efforts to install new leadership. Sometimes the drama of the boardroom spilled into pub lic. Edward P. Roski, a trustee who is also a billionaire developer, wrote a letter last year accusing Mr. Caruso of admonishing a board member he disagreed with, ""first administering a loud, abra sive tongue lashing, then kicking him out of a meeting."" Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.com and a fellow board member who is close to Mr. Caru so, said it ""was one of the most po litically charged situations I have ever witnessed."" ""These were probably some of the darkest days 1 have ever seen for U.S.C.,"" he said. For Mr. Caruso, the politically fraught drama at U.S.C. drew par allels to his role in an earlier episode in Los Angeles: as presi dent of the Police Commission in 2002, when the Los Angeles Police Department was reeling from the Rampart corruption scandal. The department, still shaken from the aftermath of the Rodney King beating and the ensuing riots, was led by Bernard Parks, who was an icon in the black community but whom many city leaders wanted gone. Mr. Caruso pushed Mr. Parks out and helped bring in William Bratton to reform the de partment. ""Rick was the one who had to manage the commission's vote to oust Parks,"" said Connie Rice, a prominent African-American civil rights lawyer. ""And I can't tell you the kind of courage that that took. And my part was, I was their ra cial shield. They couldn't remove an icon like that, unless you had the leading civil rights lawyer in the city, who is African-American, saying he needs to go."" The U.S.C. drama has attracted a great deal of public scrutiny, some of it intensely personal. Af ter U.S.C. was implicated in the bribery scandal, news emerged that one of the students who was allegedly admitted to the univer sity after her parents paid a bribe was vacationing on Mr. Caruso's yacht with his daughter. The scrutiny is sure to intensify as Mr. Caruso takes a bigger role in the city's affairs, and there is sure to be renewed talk of a possi ble run for mayor something he planned to do in 201 2 before opting out, after he had already recorded campaign commercials. It is spec ulation that Mr. Caruso welcomes. ""If there is a chance down the road, I will consider it,"" he said. For all his successes, even those who admire his business acumen question whether he could break through in politics in Los Angeles. Some of the most important de bates underway in the city are about gentrification of minority neighborhoods and the future of urban spaces. Mr. Caruso, whose developments tend to be privi leged enclaves set apart from the city, has mostly shied away from those debates, although he has supported community policing programs, paid for dozens of scholarships and supported edu cation programs on Skid Row. I think one of the biggest weak nesses of this city is we have not figured out how to reinvent and bring up the whole Los Angeles,"" he said. I think it's devastating to this city."" Still, Jill Stewart, executive di rector of the Coalition to Preserve L.A., a group that focuses on ur ban planning and promotes trans parency in government, said of Mr. Caruso: ""His heart isn't in the Zeitgeist of Los Angeles. And the Zeitgeist of Los Angeles to me is, it's a working-class city. It's a small-business city filled with mom-and-pop places. It's really not his vision of gigantic things. And I think that will always push back against him."" The issues at U.S.C., Mr. Caruso said, have forced him to think harder about a political future. ""I have to be more thoughtful about it,"" he said. ""It can't just be about me. It's got to be about the impact on my wife, the impact on the kids."" If he has a future in the politics of the city the next mayoral election is not until 2022 Mr. Ca ruso, who supported the Republi can John Kasich for president in 2016 and has also supported Dem ocrats, said if he were to run for of fice, he would do so as an inde pendent and would focus on devel opment California is in the throes of a housing crisis, and Mr. Caruso be lieves that to solve it, Los Angeles needs to grow vertically his next project is a luxury apartment tower and move away from its past as a city centered on single- family homes. He is a big pro moter of aboveground rail and be lieves the city's investments in the subway system are misguided. I don't know why we don't have a rail line that's going down the middle of the 10 freeway and the 405 that's connecting the West Side to downtown,"" he said. ""You have the right of way all the way through it But what are we going to do? We're going to spend bil lions and dig a tunnel and just screw up the whole city."" For all his attributes, though, Mr. Caruso strikes many as from another era in the mold of Rich ard Riordan, a wealthy business man who served as mayor in the 1990s. ""Whether LA., which is clearly a multicultural city, would wel come his candidacy, I don't know,"" said Jane Harman, a former con- gresswoman from California who is close to Mr. Caruso. It depends on who else is running."" Some, though, clearly would. ""I'll campaign for him,"" Ms. Pal trow said in an interview. ""I'll make the T-shirts."" Are wealth, influence and Gwyneth Paltrow enough to go on? ruck Caruso, a real estate developer and the chairman of the board of trustees at the University of Southern California, has said he might run for mayor ""if there is a chance down the road.""

650,2267099205,"As Billionaires Snap Up Open Land in West, Public Is Fenced Out PHOTOGRAPHS BY MAX WHITTAKER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES From Page 1 Some of the new owners have been welcomed. The cable magnate, John Malone, Malone, for instance, has been praised for his family’s conservation efforts, and other buyers have helped to clean up trails and restore pristine acres. The arrival of this new class of landholders landholders comes as the region is experiencing experiencing the fastest population boom in the country, which is driving up housing prices and the cost of living and leaving many residents fearful of losing their culture culture and economic stability. In Idaho, Rocky Barker, a retired columnist columnist for The Idaho Statesman, has called the conflict a “clash between two American dreams,” pitting the nation’s respect for private property rights against the notion of a beauty-rich public estate set aside for the enjoyment of all. The clash, he said, is part of a larger transformation of the region — from an economy rooted in extraction to one based on recreation; from a working class culture to a more moneyed one. “Big landowners,” he said, “are just another another new force.” The Gate Tim Horting is among the people caught up in the debate. Mr. Horting, 58, a heavy equipment salesman, grew up hiking in the woods north of Boise, a forest forest threaded by dirt routes that offer views of the state’s celebrated peaks. He learned the terrain from his father, who taught him to chop wood, gut deer and haul game home for dinner. Mr. Horting and his wife, Kim, built a cabin in those woods in 2006, right by Boise Ridge Road, which led to a popular recreation area built mostly on public land. The Hortings said they wanted their grandchildren to grow up with a feel for rural life. “This is the whole reason reason I moved here,” Mr. Horting said. For years, he assumed the road was public, and he would guide his ATV up its steep ascent, his grandchildren in tow. A generation of hikers, hunters and snowmobilers had done the same. Then, in 2016, the Wilkses purchased 172,000 acres at the edge of Mr. Horting’s home. Soon, a gate went up on the road, and a sign was tacked to a nearby tree: “Warning. Private Property. No Trespassing.” Trespassing.” To Mr. Horting and others, Boise Ridge Road was now closed. It was just the beginning. Gates with “private property” signs were going up across the region. In some places, the Wilkses’ road closings were legal. In other cases, it wasn’t clear. Road law is a tangled knot, and Boise County had little money to grapple with it in court. So the gates stayed up. The problem, said Mr. Horting, “is not the fact that they own the property. It’s that they’ve cut off public roads.” “We’re being bullied,” he added. “We can’t compete and they know it.” The Owners In recent years, longtime timber and fossil fuel investors have been joined by newer types of buyers in the region. Brokers say the new arrivals are driven driven in part by a desire to invest in natural assets while they are still abundant, particularly particularly amid a fear of economic, political political and climate volatility. “There is a tremendous underground, not-so-subtle awareness from people who realize that resources are getting Doris Burke and Alain Delaqueriere contributed contributed research. ‘There is a tremendous underground, not-so-subtle awareness from people who realize that resources are getting scarcer and scarcer/ BERNARD UECHTRITZ, a real estate adviser, on land ownership in Idaho scarcer and scarcer,” said Bernard Uechtritz, a real estate adviser.

William Bruce Harrison, the scion to an oil fortune, fortune, now owns 19 mountains in Colorado. Colorado. In the intermountain West, the purchases purchases come amid a population boom that has exacerbated local concerns about the loss of space and culture. Last year, Idaho and Nevada were the fastest growing states in the nation, followed closely by Utah, Arizona and Colorado. These new buyers have become a symbol of a bigger problem: The gentrification gentrification of the interior West. In 2018, more than 20,000 Californians arrived in Idaho; home prices around Boise also jumped 17 percent. This has meant not just new subdivisions and microbreweries, microbreweries, but also packed schools, crowded ski trails and heightened anxiety anxiety among teachers, plumbers and others, others, who are finding that they can no longer afford a first home. When Stan Kroenke, the owner of the Los Angeles Rams, purchased a vast Texas ranch in 2016, he sent eviction notices notices to dozens of people with homes around a lake, some of whom were retirees retirees with little money for a move. At the time, his representatives said he was returning returning the shoreline to a more natural state. The Wilkses The Wilks brothers, the sons of a bricklayer, bricklayer, grew up outside Cisco, Tex., a town of fewer than 4,000 people where their father father was the head of a conservative church called the Assembly of Yahweh. At first, the brothers founded a masonry masonry company. In 2001, seeing a business business opportunity, they began building fracking equipment, just as an oil-andgas oil-andgas boom took off. A decade later, they sold Frac Tech for a reported $3.5 billion. This has allowed them to donate generously generously to causes they believe in, including including right-wing media outlets, Senator Ted Cruz’s White House run and President President Trump’s re-election bid. It has also allowed them to buy enormous parcels, particularly in Montana, where they are prolific donors to local politicians, and in Idaho, where they’ve hired lobbyists to protect their interests. In Montana, they own some 300,000 acres, and have built several homes and a private airport on a property called N Bar ranch. Today, they live mostly in Texas. Justin Wilks said they had shuttered their Idaho acres to protect them, after years of unchecked snowmobiling and camping had ruined much of the landscape. landscape. “We want to be good neighbors,” Mr. Wilks said. “I know some people think we haven’t been, just because we haven’t let them freely roam across our property as they saw fit. But I’ll also offer: Do you want me camping in your front yard?” A view of Payette River canyon in Smiths Ferry, Idaho. Parts of the area are now owned by Dan and Farris Wilks, leaders among a new class of landholders who are buying up vast parcels of the West. The rub, said Tim Horting, far left, is not that the Wilkses bought chunks of land, but “that they’ve cut off public roads” and even some forest roads, left. Conservation The concept of private property is embedded embedded in the nation’s framework, and many large landowners cite this as the foundation for their holdings. “John earned everything that he’s made,” said Rye Austin, who leads the land preservation foundation created by John Malone’s family. “If he wants to purchase purchase and own land, we live in a capitalist country, why shouldn’t someone be able to buy land? That’s the whole concept of private property.” Many landowners are engaged in conservation conservation and have entered into easements easements that limit future development on their parcels, and also provide them with significant tax breaks. But setting aside land for conservation has not always staved off criticism. In Idaho, the Wilks brothers did more than gate a few roads. They also revoked road-use contracts that propped up the region’s multimillion-dollar snowmobile industry, shut down hunting on their land and told timber companies to pull crews from the area. About 100 people lost their jobs. No one claimed that those actions were illegal, but they heightened fears that local residents were losing control of the region. A 2017 video of a roadside argument argument between an armed Wilks guard and a local ATV rider traveled quickly around the state. Afterward, the Wilks family hired a lobbyist to push for a law that would stiffen stiffen penalties for trespass. The bill passed. Amid the dispute, some residents emailed the Wilkses, asking permission to cross their property. They were surprised surprised to receive a response suggesting they first visit a popular right-wing website website and share their opinions of its content. content. The site, PragerU, features videos supporting the hard-lined conservative views of personalities like Ben Shapiro and Dinesh D’Souza. The portal has been heavily financed by the Wilkses. Mr. Horting, a lifelong conservative, was “insulted,” he said. “I’m not going to give my political views to use your land.” Soon, the brothers were the subject of articles in The Idaho Statesman. County prosecutors began investigating the road closings and explored litigation. In a series of peace offerings, the brothers reopened access to some snowmobile snowmobile trails and restarted some logging. More recently, they opened the gate on Boise Ridge Road and removed the No Trespass signs. Some people in the area, including the Valley County recreation director, Larry Laxson, applauded the effort. effort. “They did a lot of things wrong when they came to Valley County,” he said, “but it’s getting better.” Mr. Wilks said he was trying to resolve access issues with frustrated neighbors. But ultimately, he said, “our Heavenly Father has blessed us with lots of gifts,” and his family’s priority was to protect them.",6/23/2019,"('problem', 'the', 'gentrification')","('the', 'interior', 'west')",[' These new buyers have become a symbol of a bigger problem: The gentrification gentrification of the interior West.'], These new buyers have become a symbol of a bigger problem The gentrification gentrification of the interior West,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3304,2754991911,"Housing Affordable to People, and Builders Cities offer subsidies, tax credits and zoning changes to coax developers, who still depend on profits. Square Feet By EUCENE L. MEYER WASHINGTON --The Wharf is a gleaming, $2.5 billion development that has transformed a long-stagnant waterfront into a major destination in the nation's capital. Along a mile of the Potomac River is an array of high-end hotels, entertain ment sites, shops, restaurants and apartments. They include the 6,000- capacity Anthem concert venue, an Intercontinental hotel and Vio, a luxury condominium where prices have soared up to S2.9 million. But the city has also required the developer to include affordable housing on the project's 24 acres. Of the 761 units in the first phase of the develop ment, 26 percent are listed as afford able, and more are promised in the second phase. From Washington to San Francisco, municipal leaders are facing increased pressure to provide affordable housing. Using a combination of government subsidies, tax credits and zoning changes, they are encouraging develop ers to incorporate affordable units into mixed-use projects. The Wharf development is a partner ship between PN Hoffman and Madison Marquette, developers based in Wash ington. Monty Hoffman, chief executive of PN Hoffman, takes great pride in the affordable housing. To make the Wharf project profitable, the partners sought to adjust the mix and build more units over all. The Dis trict of Columbia lowered its price for the land and reduced the percentage of lowest-cost housing while permitting more below-market, moderate-income ""work force"" units. ""It allowed us to avoid residential offerings only at the extreme ends deep affordable and waterfront market rate,"" Mr. Hoffman said. Absent such concessions, he said, he would have needed more office, hospitality, retail and market-rate housing to make the numbers work. ""We did not want to create a tourist or office-centric park,"" he said. ""We wanted a balanced community."" Developers across the nation are finding that economics are crucial in determining how many and at what price such units may be included for a mixed-use project to be both socially responsive and financially profitable. And they are working with community leaders to find the right equation. To further construction of multifam- ily units, Minneapolis recently moved to rezone most of the city to ban new single-family homes. Several Sun Belt cities, including Atlanta; Austin, Tex; and Houston, now encourage a percent age of affordable units in any mixed- use project. California's landscape is more chal lenging. Its residential property tax cap, an amendment to the State Consti tution passed in 1978 and known as Proposition 13, forced localities to push for commercial development to gener ate revenue needed for schools, parks, the police and other public services. Still, developers there are including moderate-income units in the mix, said Michael A. Covarrubias, chief executive of TMG Partners, a developer based in San Francisco. But, he added, the high cost of land has made that difficult. And the developer has to contend with residents opposed to gentrification in their neighborhoods. ""Affordable housing has been un available,"" Mr. Covarrubias said. ""It's a hornet's nest and a complicated road you go down to get the volume you need."" To help address the problem, the tech giant Google has pledged to invest SI billion in land and money to build homes, including those deemed afford able in the Bay Area. In Northern Vir ginia, J BG Smith has raised S78 million from investors for housing aimed at those who earn too much for govern ment help but not enough to afford market rates. The firm is the dominant landlord in Crystal City, the section of Arlington where Amazon is locating its second headquarters, with 25,000 new jobs. In Washington, market forces threat en to overtake government efforts to slow the gentrification of previously low-income neighborhoods, making them less affordable for longtime Afri can-American residents and leading to cultural clashes. The Metropolitan Washington Coun cil of Governments has said the region needs to build more than 100,000 hous ing units by 2045, of which 40 percent should serve the lowest-income resi dents. Separately, the District of Colum bia has set a goal of 36,000 units by 2025, of which 12,000 would be afford able. To reach that goal, the district's mayor, Muriel E. Bowser, has offered solutions that include a $100 million annual housing production trust fund, regulatory relief and a higher building height limit. ""We just have to do many different things,"" said Brian T. Kenner, a former deputy mayor for planning and eco nomic development, who left district government on July 2 to work for Ama zon. ""Things we did before we have to alter, whether it's making inclusive zoning even more robust or limited setbacks."" The challenge for local governments is to find incentives like tax breaks that encourage developers, Mr. Kenner said. ""Government can't buy its way out."" But government, he said, remains concerned about the negative impact of development, which can displace resi dents as it alters neighborhoods. The issue has come into focus with plans to turn Brookland Manor, an 80-year-old, 535-unit garden apartment complex in northeast Washington, into a 1,700-unit, $600 million mixed-use development. The old complex included a small strip shopping center. Once predomi nantly occupied by low- and middle- income white families, the complex became home to a mostly African- American community after whites left the district for the suburbs. In deterio rating condition, it underwent a federal ly subsidized renovation in the early 1970s that led to litigation from resi dents who feared displacement. That same battle is being replayed as MidCity Financial Corporation, its owner, seeks to triple the number of units, including townhomcs and 22 percent lower-cost apartments along side 181,000 square feet of retail. Resi dents are divided, despite MidCity's promises to avoid displacing them. Some tenants object to the elimination of 134 four- and five-bedroom apart ments for large families, and two law suits are working their way through the courts. Two original buildings have been razed, as has the old shopping center, now a fenced-in lot with a sign urging an end to ail gun violence. Despite the complaints of some residents, the pro posed number of affordable units ex ceeds city requirements. The District of Columbia is in a stronger position with properties it owns or controls, and requires 30 per cent affordable housing units. The city encompasses several large parcels of former federal land ripe for develop ment. These include the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center and St. Elizabeths Hospital, east of the Anacos- tia River. The 190-acre Robert F. Ken nedy Stadium site is also up for grabs. Developers and community groups are monitoring these parcels closely. To show activists the projects under devel opment or soon to be, the Washington Interfaith Network ran several bus tours this year. Tbur guides noted po tential conflicts as the city seeks to reap new tax revenue while requiring devel opers to include socially desirable, if less profitable, features. ""At some point, you realize there's just a machine that's running,"" said the Rev. Frankey Grayton, pastor of Edge- wood Baptist Church in Washington and a prominent activist with WIN. ""The development is happening at an alarming rate."" Pastor Grayton was standing in front of a fenced building site in what is known as Hill East, a 67-acre parcel on the Anacostia River. City planners have long envisioned this tract, home to the now-closed D.C. General Hospital and other social-welfare buildings, as per fect for waterfront development. As this prospect comes closer into view, community activists are organ izing to ensure that low-income housing is included. In the first two buildings, it already is. On what was the parking lot of D.C. General, a 202-unit, five-story apart ment building is rising, one of two that will be the vanguard of Hill East. There will be 25,000 square feet of ground- floor retail and 106 low- and moderate- priced rentals, 30 percent of the total. But it has been nine years in the making. After many meetings, hear ings, permits and approvals, the mixed- use project is finally happening. ""It takes a village, as we say, to figure out the finances, the uses, the zoning,"" Mr. Covarrubias, the San Francisco developer, said. ""It's a long, slow process.""

2843,2756153755,"Trying to Recapture That Old School Spirit Kristen Bell returns as a private detective, though no longer a teenage one. MIKE HALE ""VERONICA MARS."" which ran for three seasons on UPN and CW from 2004 to 2007. has become the zombie of entertainment franchises: revived using Kickstarter for a 2014 feature film, and now revived again for an eight-episode fourth season on Hulu. Season 4 was shock-released on Friday, a week ahead of schedule, and like the film (also called ""Veronica Mars""), it reunites the central cast, which has stuck with the story across 15 years. Kristen Bell is Veroni ca, the cynical daddy's girl and tough Cali fornia beach-town private eye, a cocktail of Nancy Drew and Sam Spade. Enrico Colan- toni is Keith Mars, her wry father and men tor, banged up and fearing dementia after the brutal conclusion of the film. And Jason Dohring is back as Logan Echolls, her bad- boy boyfriend, now a naval intelligence offi cer whose absences on secret missions sup ply the relationship angst formerly fueled by teenage moodiness and violence. These three and a number of regular sup porting players, including the friends por trayed by Percy Daggs III, Francis Capra and Ryan Hansen, solve a mystery who's setting off bombs targeting spring breakers in the seedier sections of Neptune, the home base of Mars Investigations while enact ing the show's familiar, and still entertain ing, lightly comic spin on hard-boiled noir. We're not in high school anymore, though, and as Veronica agonizes over her future with Logan, frets about Keith's health and bemoans the continuing gentrification of Neptune, her nostalgia for a simpler time may be paralleled by the viewer's nostalgia for the immediate pleasures of the show's splendid first season. Do we need more ""Ve ronica Mars,"" even if it continues to arrive in polished and pleasing packages? Opening during Veronica's junior year at Neptune High, the series originally stood out for its clever and literate writing and the superior performances of Bell. Colantoni and Dohring. (Rob Thomas, the show's cre ator, still oversees it and wrote the new sea son's first and last episodes.) It was perhaps even more unusual for the way it presented a teenage world, and a story hinging on teenage melodrama, from a wised-up, adult point of view and with a fully adult emo tional sensibility. The adult intelligence is still there, and Bell and Colantoni are still wonderful to gether, consistently nailing the old-Holly wood, tough-and-tender style the show de mands and demonstrating seemingly ef fortless comic grace. But Thomas hasn't found a really satisfactory replacement for the show's loss of teen spirit; and the grown-up romantic travails of Veronica and Logan, a significant subplot in the new sea son, aren't as compelling as their tempestu ous high school amours. It's also a problem that the streaming- season model entails stretching a single mystery over close to eight hours. That's new for ""Veronica Mars"" the network seasons had long-arc mysteries, but they were broken up by lighter stand-alone cases over their 22 episodes. Thomas has put to gether a complicated caper in Season 4, with the bombings simultaneously investi gated by Veronica and Keith, the hapless Neptune police, u group of true-crime nerds, a pair of Mexican cartel hit men and Matty, a young woman who evolves into Ve ronica's protegee. (Played by Izabela Vi- dovic, Matty fills the vacuum left by Ttna Majorino's pugnacious Mac, the one central character who doesn't return.) Some of the twists are clever, but in the eight-episode format the story's iniplausibilities are more distracting. The seams show in a way that didn't used to matter. (There's another more directly annoying consequence of the move to streaming: sev eral obtrusive product placements for Hulu itself, including a scene in which Veronica and Keith settle in to binge the last show you can imagine them watching, the British cos tume drama ""Harlots."") Still, whenever the love story starts to drag or the mystery gets irritatingly convo luted, and despite an abrupt (and seem ingly convenient) late detour into tragedy. ""Veronica Mars"" finds ways to charm you. Bell's sparkle no one does pluckincss bet ter, or funnier and Colantoni's utterly re laxed, jazzlike timing are gi vens. Old favor ites like Daran Norris, Dunne Daniels and especially Max Greenfield make their usual solid comic contributions. (The chemistry between Bell and Greenfield puts a spot light on the show's failure to grow Dohring's character into an interesting adult.) The show has fun with its own history, as in a touching scene when Daggs's Wullacc, now a teacher, watches Matty extract informa tion from a love-struck mark just like Veron ica used to when he was her high school ac complice. The season also benefits from the addi tion of a pair of performers whose contrast ing styles speak to the show's blend of gen res: Patton Oswalt, bringing his nervous screwball energy to the role of a pizza dcliv- eryniun and amateur sleuth, and J. K. Sim mons, supplying noirish menace and cool as an aging ex-con and fixer who sees a soul- mate in Keith. (Simmons and Colantoni's scenes together constitute the season's most satisfying romance.)

But that rapid growth makes keeping up with all the new shows — let alone discerning what’s worthy of your time — even harder. So we’re going to help with that. Each month, we’ll be assembling a mix of the latest releases, looking in particular for things that don’t necessarily make it onto the “New and Notable” section of your listening app. We’ll bring you a fresh mix, across genres and styles, of the most intriguing new shows in the medium. Here’s what you may have missed so far this summer. ‘PANG!’ ‘Los Angeles’ “Pang!” is an experiment in the dynamic power of the podcast medium as it endeavors to answer the question, “What does hunger sound like in America?” The first episode, “Los Angeles,” is an audio drama in the style of old-time radio plays. First adapted for the stage, and now for headphones, this play is based on the oral history of an American family living in hunger. As you hear gutwrenching gutwrenching performances depicting the life of a single mother of nine and her uncle’s struggle struggle to hold onto the family home of 70 years, you might wonder how a play that barely mentions food scarcity could answer that original question. Yet the second episode, which drops Monday, pivots into reality with interviews with the actual family members that this play was based on, who will “teach us how to hear hunger in every moment” of their story. The rest of this monthly series will give the same treatment to families below below the poverty line in Miami and Cedar Rapids, Rapids, Iowa. ‘BANDTASTIC’ ‘Seabass of Earth’ For kids with a goofy sense of humor, HimaOLIVIER HimaOLIVIER AWARD DRAMA DESKAWARD OUTER CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD GRAMMYAWARD TODAYAT2&8 TOMORROW AT 2 & 7, TUESDAY AT 7 “THE BEST MUSICAL OFTHIS CENTURY.” - Ben Brantley, The New York Times THE BOOK OF MORMON 877-250-2929 or Ticketmaster.com Groups 10+: 866-302-0995 BookofMormonBroadway.com Tue - Thu 7; Fri 8; Sat 2 & 8; Sun 2 & 7 Eugene O'Neill Theatre (+), 230 W 49th St HOUUN ROUGE!

Yet violence has flared, most notably in the Isla Vista, Calif., massacre of 2014 and recently in Toronto. In “Incel,” a 10-part series of conversations with members of the community, the filmmaker filmmaker Naama Kates explores their backgrounds, backgrounds, rationalizations and hopes. Kates takes a deep dive into what happens to a community like this as it is deplatformed — that is, banned from mainstream social networks networks and internet services and relegated to the darkest corners of the deep web. She explores explores how the media has positioned incels at odds with the outside world, further distancing distancing them and amplifying their echo chamber. In later episodes, Kates will talk to top posters posters and moderators of incels’ online communities communities about the violence these internet subcultures subcultures can beget and, most importantly, why. ‘LARGER THAN LIFE’ ‘King of the Street’ After the breakout success of “Dirty John,” the Los Angeles Times’s podcast studio has consistently churned out gripping investigative investigative series. While its newest mystery, “Room 20,” is enjoying a lot of attention at the top of the “Most Listened To” charts, the studio also released last month a biographical investigation investigation of the street racer and peacemaker peacemaker “Big Willie” Robinson. “Larger Than Life” tells the story of Robinson, a Green Beret Beret who fought in Vietnam and, on his return to Los Angeles, used drag racing to unite even the most entrenched enemies. The outsized outsized friend to all was featured in songs, movies, and was even said to be asked to play Darth Vader — yet for some reason he has been largely forgotten in the seven years since his death. This seven-part series tells us how Robinson was able to forge peace amid chaos and violence and, ultimately, why he faded into obscurity. ‘LOCKED’ ‘I’m Not a Monster Like Most People Think’ In the opening scene of this investigation from Boise State Public Radio and Mountain West News Bureau, Adree Edmo, a 27-yearold 27-yearold transgender woman in an all-male prison, prison, composes a note making clear that what she is about to do is not a suicide attempt. It is, instead, what she feels she must do to her body in order for it to match her gender identity. identity. The rest of the “Locked” podcast is the story of Edmo’s lawsuit against the state of Idaho for the right to sex reassignment surgery. This reported narrative grapples with the issues of health care rights and access access for transgender inmates. An impending ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could have widespread implications for the broader incarcerated L.G.B.T.Q. community, and the podcast will update when it lands. ‘THE SECRET LIVES OF BLACK WOMEN’ ‘Being a Black Face in a White Space with Bari A. Williams’ There is a lot of compassion, reflection and affirmation in this two-friends-interview-aguest-style two-friends-interview-aguest-style podcast from the comedian/writer comedian/writer Charla Lauriston and the producer/writer Lauren Domino. Their mission is to reveal the secrets of daily and spiritual survival that allow black women to thrive in a society built on the premise that they should not. Lauriston and Domino are honest about their struggles with anxiety, depression and fury, and talk with their guests, like Tarriona Ball, who is also known as Tank and is the front woman of Tank and the Bangas, about their shared experiences and ways of healing. healing. The first episode, featuring the lawyer and tech executive Bari A. Williams, gets into the gentrification of Oakland, Calif.; “diversity “diversity hires” and the homogeneity of the tech world; workplace microaggressions; and the constant barriers black women must face to simply do their jobs. ‘CONAN O’BRIEN NEEDS A FRIEND MINI-SERIES’ ‘Deep Dive with Dana Carvey' Conan O’Brien’s interview podcast show may not be exactly new — he has already had over 30 hilarious, surprisingly profound conversations with comedy celebrities from his TV show who he’d like to be friends with in real life. But this six-episode series, “Deep Dive,” is pure joy as O’Brien and the “Saturday “Saturday Night Live” alumnus Dana Carvey riff, trade impersonations and nonsense words, and, as promised, go deep. The first episode starts with Paul McCartney (Carvey) reaching reaching out to George Harrison (O’Brien) in the afterlife and struggling to explain President Trump, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Instagram. Instagram. ‘TABLOID: THE MAKING OF IVANKA TRUMP’ ‘Who Is Ivanka?’ Before her father’s presidential win, Ivanka Trump was known as a New York City party girl, a beautiful, blond heiress who frequently frequently appeared on the pages of the tabloids tabloids dancing to DMX or along the runways of fashion shows. Vanessa Grigoriadis, the New York magazine journalist and host of “Tabloid,” grew up in some of the same circles circles as Ivanka, and finds herself unable to square the fun, cool-girl socialite from the tabloids with the “icy fembot” adviser to President Trump. Grigoriadis interviews many in Ivanka’s sphere, including her mother, Ivana, to determine whether Ivanka is her father’s victim or his mini-me. This Luminary Luminary premium podcast will likely only be enjoyable to those who are critical of Trump.",8/10/2019,"('gets', 'into', 'the')","('oakland', 'calif', 'diversity')","[' Williams, gets into the gentrification of Oakland, Calif.']", Williams gets into the gentrification of Oakland Calif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3584,2755037364,"Seeing Whiteness Onscreen White film directors are finally examining race: their own. By JENNA WORTHAM A few years ago, on their wildly popular podcast, ""Bodega Boys,"" the comedians Desus Nice and Kid Mero coined the term ""caucacity,"" which was essentially a portmanteau of Caucasian and audacity. They employed it to marvel at the baffling behaviors of white folks, like a predilection for pumpkin spice anything. Over time, it... came widely used internet shorthand for the ways in which white entitlement, fla grant displays of privilege and exceptions that eluded other groups weave their way through our society. The thing about caucacity is that there are levels to it, and it is safe to say we are at an all-time high. Take, for example, every thing about Elizabeth Holmes. The college admissions scandal. The desire to blame anything other than racism for the terror of the El Paso shooting. Caucacity isn't just something for Desus, Mero and their fans to process alone any more. Lately, I've been noticing a steady stream of cultural properties addressing whiteness either head on, as in the case of the period drama ""The Nightingale,"" or sideways, with a surrealist, abstract bent, as in the horror tale ""Midsommar,"" both made by white filmmakers. And what a relief. As a friend put it to me recently, ""This is white people's job now,"" meaning that it's time for white people to start helping each other see themselves in terms of their race and all the undeserved, inherited privilege that comes with it. It's a self-examination that knows the difference between ""woke"" and self-awareness, and leans toward the latter. It's not easy work. ""White progressives can be the most diffi cult for people,"" Robin DiAngelo writes in her groundbreaking book, ""White Fragil- CONTINUED ON PAGE 10 Seeing Whiteness on the Movie Screen CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 ity,"" because she and others ""do indeed up hold and perpetuate racism, but our defen- siveness and certitude make it virtually im possible to explain to us how we do so."" Jennifer Kent's dark drama ""The Nightin gale"" is making headlines for vicious assault scenes that reportedly required psycholo gists on the set to help actors cope. Ruth lessly dropping viewers into the carnage of colonization, the film is set in the 1800s in what is now known as Tasmania. It follows a young Irish convict, Clare (Aisling Fran- ciosi), who loses her entire family to British brutality and sets out to kill the perpetra tors. Kent said in an interview that she felt it was her duty as a filmmaker to ""face these terrible things that happened, to move for ward."" She added, ""We see in our modern lives what happens when people don't."" Kent, an Australian best known for her 2014 domestic horror film, ""The Babadook,"" ex plained that the same violence that created colonialism was the same violence scarring the world ""left, right and center"" today. Kent's film isn't perfectly rendered. It centers on the terror and rage of a white woman whose own bondage and subse quent trauma let her ignore the abhorrent racial hierarchies (and her participation in them) that allowed for the decimation of the indigenous histories and cultures of Tasma nia. For help on her quest, she hires an in digenous man called Billy (Baykali Ganam- barr) and can barely contain her self-ab sorption and contempt. In one scene, the two sit by a fire and Billy describes being chained and beaten as he was taken from his family; watching as his loved ones are murdered; and the painful alienation that ensues from the erasure of the rituals and cultures of his people. ""Poor you,"" Clare sneers. ""You think you're the only one with problems?"" Sure, her story is tragic orphaned at a young age, living on the streets but on the same level as the genocide of an entire people? In many ways, Claire's fury is her privi lege. She can move through the country rel atively easily, whereas the man she paid to help her navigate the unfamiliar terrain vanishes each time white men appear, fear ing for his life. He knows what she may never grasp: that despite the cruelty that she and her family endure, he and his people suffer more. When an indigenous woman experiences the same brutality that sets the film in motion, it happens offscreen, demot ing its importance. (For all of the outrage this movie has sparked, only the attacks on Clare seem to be mentioned.) COLONIZERS, OF COURSE, experienced their own cultural conditioning that few popular historical narratives have tried to explore. The film doesn't so much try to understand their pathology as it does silently and me thodically tally the damage, allowing the horrors to haunt and metastasize within the characters and presumably, the genera tions to come after them. Nonetheless, ""The Nightingale"" is still ef fective: It unearths the root of settler men tality and violence that so much of history has effectively wallpapered over. The film points a finger directly at the greed of em pire, and at the deliberate and elaborate so cial construction of whiteness to oppress, to ravage, to raze, to devastate, to occupy and to conquer. Kent doesn't try to rationalize she simply shows all this in a horrid light, allowing viewers to understand the high cost of their modern-day lives. In a way, the descendants of those charac ters take up metaphorical residence in the eerie Utopia of Ari Aster's ""Midsommar,"" the colorful fun house of a film about a group of friends who travel to a remote area in Swe den for a festival that turns out to be more Marilyn Manson than Joanna Newsom. As the group arrives in the village of Harga for the midsummer celebrations, they're ushered into a sun-dappled paradise by a swarm of pink-cheeked, smiling blond people. The scene is supposed to read as idyllic, a reprieve from the gross American capitalism and modernized world. But the homogeneity of the people seethes with a dormant violence. That area of the world had an indigenous population, too, now known as the Sami, whose story echoes all of the stories of peoples who lived on land usurped by colonizers. As it turns out, paradise is expensive, and the cost in ""Midsommar"" includes incest, torture, ritual sex and senicide. Although audiences are supposed to recoil as each fresh hell is revealed, no one in the village ever seems perturbed. After all, this is how things have always been done and noth ing is too expensive if it means the preser vation of their village's purity, their rituals and their way of life: a perfect metaphor for the historical violence and legacy of white ness. Both of those films contain graphic vio lence that I don't entirely recommend to anyone. But I preferred their bloodiness to the Krispy Kreme soft-focus glaze that coated the indie darling ""The Last Black Man in San Francisco,"" a film by Joe Talbot (also white), about the economic tides erod ing communities of color in the Bay Area, and the efforts of a character named Jim- mie to reclaim his childhood Victorian home (reminiscent of the one the lead actor, Jim- mie Fails, lived in until he was 6). The movie has been heralded as a searing portrait of gentrification, of the brutal ways that black people have been disenfran chised to make way for white progress. But the film suffers from the same unexamined beliefs informing our racial realities that Di- Angelo writes about in ""White Fragility."" ONEOFTHE FILM'S most triumphant scenes revolves around an interaction between the lead character, Jimmie, and a group of tour ists floating by on Segways past his child hood home. The scene reads as grotesquely comic. They can't even be bothered to walk, you guys.' Jimmie watches calmly as the tour guide says the ""before the black thing,"" this area was largely inhabited by Japa nese-Americans until the 1940s, when they were forced into internment camps during World War II. Jimmie interrupts this his tory lesson to inform them that the house was in fact built by his grandfather. The exchange is meant to paint Jimmie as our unlikely hero and establish his right ful place in the landscape, no matter how many Google busloads of tech bros arrive. But it also has the unfortunate effect of lim iting the ownership struggles in the Bay Area to a black-white binary, continuing the grotesque erasure of the stories of the Japa nese, Chinese, Latinx and Native communi ties that have suffered, and still do. To make a film about gentrification with out acknowledging these waves of migra tion is as sinister and violent as the fiery, closing scenes of ""Midsommar."" The investment in aesthetics over ethics in ""Last Black Man"" is perfectly captured when Jimmie and his friend Montgomery make a cake in the Victorian's kitchen. The scene itself looks as delicious as a pastry warm lighting and the decadent backdrop of a Pinterest-worthy space. The two share a heartwarming moment as they stir the batter. But they never bake the cake. These are men who need actual nourishment, who need actual meals, and warmth and love. Not just the performance of it. The film has a noble cause but after a while, the loving gaze of the camera starts to feel perverse. The film is way more invested in empty caloric scenes like these than in diving deeper into the complicated entanglement of ownership, inheritance and entitlement for displaced folks like Jimmie and Mont gomery. The final scenes include a startling revelation about the house that undermines Jimmie's entire motivation, leaving the story arc as unfinished as that cake. Aesthetics as activism can be dangerous. And it's wholly unsatisfying, too. In an in terview with Deadline.com, the director said that he was a fifth-generation San Franciscan. ""On my dad's side, he came with that great wave in the '60s,"" Talbot said. ""People that just wanted something to believe in."" Talbot found Fails's story worthier than his own. That was a miscalculation. And as grateful as 1 was to see Danny Glover (as Montgomery's father) and Tichina Arnold (as Jimmie's aunt) in, well, anything, 1 won der if Talbot would have been better served trying to parse his own family's role in the gentrification of San Francisco, which ac celerated during the wave that Talbot's fa ther participated in and contributed to the technological boomtown that now con sumes the region. What was Talbot's father looking for? Did he find it? Who were his neighbors? What were their lives like? Where are they all now? Those questions and pursuits are as fascinating as anyone else's, and the anti dote to this moment that we're in is not con tinuing to ignore that.

3559,2302819622,"Pirates, Slavers and Poachers A chronicle of offshore crime that ranges from Somalia to the Philippines to the Antarctic. By BLAIR BRAVERMAN IF YOU’RE like I am, you don’t think much about the oceans — what Ernest Shackleton Shackleton called “the void spaces of the world.” When I’ve thought about them, it’s mostly in the context of how they affect the land: what rising sea levels mean for coastal cities, cities, for example, or how the Gulf Stream shapes the Arctic climate. In “The Outlaw Ocean,” the journalist Ian Urbina highlights highlights how, in overlooking the seas, we’ve allowed that void to become a vacuum for corruption, violence and lawlessness, a stage for gruesome deaths and even more gruesome lives — and then he brings us into intimate contact with those lives, forcing forcing witness. “The Outlaw Ocean” represents a fouryear fouryear project, built on a series of deeply reported reported features for The New York Times that brought Urbina from the Antarctic to Somalia — but most of it takes place in the impenetrable vastness of the high seas, a THE OUTLAW OCEAN Journeys Across the Last Untamed Frontier By Ian Urbina 542 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. Illustrated. $30. region that begins 13 miles from shore. Each chapter tells a different story, in locations locations ranging from the City of Lights, a glowing patch of the Atlantic where hundreds hundreds of poachers shine light into the water to catch squid, to unmarked pirate ships and even cruise ships, which Urbina calls “a kind of gentrification of the ocean.” Many of these stories revolve around the lives of fishermen, who are overwhelmingly overwhelmingly poor and unprotected. We meet 31year-old 31year-old Eril Andrade, an aspiring policeman policeman who traveled to Singapore for a deckhand deckhand job and was sent home to the Philippines Philippines dead, seven months later, his body blackened from the onboard freezer. In tracking Andrade’s course, Urbina uncovers uncovers a network of exploitation, piecing together together a path that leads to a greasy, urinescented urinescented apartment — with a manager who rapes the prospective fishermen at night — to tuna ships where the crew members are routinely threatened and beaten. But more than that, he uncovers a system designed designed to prevent accountability. The ocean “lends itself to a bystander’s syndrome: syndrome: a pathological and unshakable assumption assumption that someone else will police those crimes or fix those wrongdoings.... This void is not a tragedy but an opportunity.” opportunity.” In other words, for those who employ fishermen, the impunity is the point. Some workers like Andrade enroll by choice — although when you turn to something something out of desperation, is it really a blair braverman is a dog-sledder, a correspondent correspondent for Outside magazine and the author author of “Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube.” choice? — while others come to the sea through more insidious means. Employment Employment agencies offer promises of fair income, income, then charge high hidden fees, trapping trapping fishermen in a cycle of debt slavery. In the South China Sea, “unscrupulous captains captains buy and sell the men and boys like chattel.” In the port town of Ranong, in southern Thailand, Urbina encounters sex slaves, trafficked girls used as lures to entrap entrap boys into a different kind of slavery. Urbina cites the ecologist Garret Hardin’s “The Tragedy of the Commons,” which argues that communal resources will be overexploited and underprotected; the concept applies not just to the seas themselves but to the over 56 million people people who fish there, a source of cheap labor for whom few take responsibility. (Women represent a minuscule fraction of global fishing workers; in his travels, Urbina encounters encounters nearly only men.) Attempts to enforce enforce rules, whether by the wealth-backed vigilantes of the maritime conservation group Sea Shepherd or the Indiegogofunded Indiegogofunded maritime police of the nation of Palau, Palau, fall almost laughably short. “The more I explored the outlaw ocean,” Urbina writes, “the tougher it became to distinguish distinguish the predators from the prey.” Workers Workers on illegal fishing ships may have no idea that they’re breaking the law; those who report misdeeds lose the jobs they depend depend on. “We stood up,” explains a former deckhand who helped expose inhumane conditions — sailors raped, locked in refrigerators, refrigerators, and forced to pull in amounts of fish that they knew would sink them — on a South Korean trawler. “Now the rest A Cambodian migrant fisherman on a Thai flagged fishing boat in the Gulf of Thailand in 2014. are benefiting and we can t work again. Even when countries pass laws to protect workers, ships can just sail elsewhere. There is no way to govern the seas without loopholes. The ocean is a loophole. Of course, not all loopholes are used for evil — some uses are absurd, or even humanitarian. humanitarian. In one chapter, the principality of Sealand uses its dubious claim to sovereignty to create a data haven for illicit illicit content (and to sell merch and knighthood knighthood online). In another, the Dutch doctor Urbina establishes a secret code for his family in case he’s taken hostage, then drains the battery on his inReach anyway. and artist Rebecca Gomperts sails the world in a sloop, offering safe abortions near countries where they’re illegal. Urbina joins her in Ixtapa, Mexico, as she races waves and authorities out of port with two frightened pregnant women on board. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Urbina finds that governments seem far more motivated motivated to block Gomperts’s work, which is legal in international waters, than to protect protect fishermen from, say, murder, which is not. These chapters are vibrant as individual stories, but as a collection they’re transcendent, transcendent, rendering a complex portrait of an unseen and disturbing world. Urbina pursues a depth of reportage that’s rare because because of the guts and diligence it requires — not to mention the budget, which must have been enormous. The result is not just a fascinating read, but a truly important document. It is also a master class in journalism. As he enters these worlds, Urbina provides glimpses into his methods, his fears and misconceptions. He describes how, even at home, he keeps a backpack ready to leave at a moment’s notice; he recounts failed attempts attempts to reach ships, bribes and begging and desperate solutions. He explains the choreographed silence during an interview interview with a former slave, and establishes a secret code for his family in case he’s taken hostage, then drains the battery on his inReach inReach anyway. This kind of writing — a catalog of the reporter’s process — can veer into self-indulgence, but for Urbina it’s another tool by which he invites readers readers into communities, demonstrating how isolated they are, how vulnerable and suspicious, suspicious, and how their governance is designed designed to hold no one truly accountable. For all it exposes, “The Outlaw Ocean” doesn’t offer the comfort of a call to action. No buy-this-instead-of-that seafood guides; no illusion of consumer choices as an answer. Instead, we are left with the discomfort discomfort of complicity. There is no clear solution solution to the ocean’s problems because our entire world — our economic system, our geography — is the cause. I’d always assumed assumed the greatest threat to the ocean was the greed of the rich, but in fact it’s the desperation desperation of the poor, which is, of course, the flip side of the same coin. As long as there is desperation, there will be exploitation. And people, good and bad, will always be able to use the ocean to disappear. □",9/15/2019,"('a', 'kind', 'of')","('the', 'ocean', 'many')","[' Each chapter tells a different story, in locations locations ranging from the City of Lights, a glowing patch of the Atlantic where hundreds hundreds of poachers shine light into the water to catch squid, to unmarked pirate ships and even cruise ships, which Urbina calls “a kind of gentrification of the ocean.']", Each chapter tells a different story in locations locations ranging from the City of Lights a glowing patch of the Atlantic where hundreds hundreds of poachers shine light into the water to catch squid to unmarked pirate ships and even cruise ships which Urbina calls a kind of gentrification of the ocean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many, many performances — Esa-Pekka Salonen’s resplendent recent account account of Hindemith’s “Mathis der Maler” Symphony with the Philharmonic comes to mind — at which no one in the audience could think the acoustics were problematic. Still, the sound is not ideal. But it may improve. On Monday, the Philharmonic Philharmonic and Lincoln Center announced a $550 million project to “reimagine” Geffen Hall — a long-promised, often-contentious and much-delayed goal. Many of the proposed proposed changes, perhaps the most important ones, promise enhanced amenities and revamped revamped public spaces throughout the hall. Indeed, “amenities” seems inadequate to describe how transformative the improvements improvements could be for performers and audiences. audiences. I’d argue that the physical details of a concert hall are crucially important for classical classical music, more so than for other performing performing arts. With theater and dance, there’s much to watch and stories to follow. Many older Broadway theaters have terrible amenities, as anyone who’s tried to go to the bathroom at intermission will know. But you don’t really care if you have a seat — any seat — for “Hamilton.” Opera is in this category. But an orchestra doesn’t offer the same kind of visual stimulation. stimulation. While there’s certainly an impressive impressive visual component to a big ensemble uniting for a Beethoven or Mahler symphony, symphony, the drama comes almost entirely from hearing the music.

That theme is at the center of an exhibition exhibition opening on Wednesday in Miami, outside outside of the official Art Basel program, bluntly titled “Who Owns Black Art?” It is spearheaded by Zeal, a studio and creative agency supporting black visual and performance artists that started last year. The exhibition highlights the underrepresentation underrepresentation of black people at various levels of the art world — from the rosters at major fairs to the ownership ranks of galleries galleries to the consumers purchasing work. “It’s fine for us to be the producers of culture culture and the generators of culture,” said Tia Oso, Zeal’s West Coast principal manager and an organizer of the show. “But when it’s time for us to reap a value or the reward, or even be recognized for the genius of our creativity, creativity, then it seems that there’s a problem.” problem.” The three-day exhibition, featuring work from more than a dozen emerging black artists, artists, including Ms. Mena, who is also curating curating the show, reflects on the question of black art ownership. Organizers and participating participating artists say the conversation is broad. In one sense, it’s calling attention to the need for black people to become more active active as art buyers so as not to miss out on potentially lucrative investments. In another another sense, it’s about the dearth of blackowned blackowned galleries. And it also addresses unmore unmore intimate and pleasurable helps you immerse yourself. Acoustics are, of course, crucial. Still, it’s amazing how much the phenomenon of psychoacoustics psychoacoustics can come into play: the idea that the experience or look of a concert hall affects what you hear. (Is it a coincidence that so many describe the sound at gilded Carnegie Hall as warm and golden?) From the plans described on Monday by the project’s acoustician, Paul Scarbrough of the firm Akustiks, there will be notable improvements to the pure sound in the hall, especially the resonance of bass frequencies. frequencies. Seating capacity will be reduced from around 2,700 seats to roughly 2,200, much closer to the widely agreed upon sweet spot for a concert hall’s acoustics. But that reduction in seating will be just as important because it will increase the derrepresentation among the ranks of museum museum staff, fair directors and other arbiters who have significant influence over which works and artists get elevated. A survey published this year by the Andrew Andrew W. Mellon Foundation found that while diversity in museum leadership grew by five percentage points from 2015 to 2018, people of color account for one in five people in those positions. Black-owned or operated galleries are virtually absent among the exhibitors at the official Art Basel show. (Fair organizers said they did not know how many such presenting galleries were at the Miami show.) But Karla Ferguson, a staple of the local art world as the founder and chief executive executive of Yeelen, a gallery in Little Haiti, said she did not know of any. The small number of black gallerists and curators across the industry means that, to some extent, black people do not fully own the stories that black art tells, Ms. Ferguson said. Curators and gallerists can decide, for instance, to stay away from work that tackles tackles tough issues; or they may elevate those pieces that fit their notions of black culture, she said. “Historically the narrative has been very much through the white male gaze,” Ms. Ferguson said. When that happens, she added, “You’ll never have a completely authentic authentic story.” The location of “Who Owns Black Art?” in the Miami Urban Contemporary Experience Experience event space in Little Haiti also speaks to the question of ownership. Art Basel has contributed to the gentrification of the Wynwood Wynwood neighborhood in Miami, and there is great concern that Little Haiti — with its flourishing indie art galleries, and trendy eateries replacing botanicas — is well on its way to a similar fate. None of this, organizers say, is to suggest that there isn't plenty of black art out there that gets wide recognition. Art Basel has made strides over the years to diversify its exhibitions in Miami and to bring attention to shows happening outside its official program. program. (A pamphlet advertising shows centered centered on artists from the African diaspora will be included as an insert in the official Art Basel guide.) Still, some black artists said that was not enough. Rhea Leonard, a 28-year-old Miami artist, artist, likes to build a connection with patrons interested in her work. At the “Who Owns Black Art?” show, she is exhibiting a sculpture sculpture of what first appears to be an ordinary NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS hall’s intimacy and warmth.

Geffen Hall’s teeming lobby will double in size, hopefully reducing congestion; the designers designers have pledged to make the security situation smoother. The currently wasted northeast corner of the building will be turned into a “Sidewalk Studio” for educational educational and community activities, visible from the street. The Grand Promenade will be reconfigured, with expanded intermission intermission seating and food service (and, therefore, therefore, shorter lines).

The piece is meant to symbolize the commodification commodification of black bodies, she said, and to make a statement about how people “are so apt to want to take parts of black culture, but don’t want to engage in the trauma of it.” Ms. Leonard said it’s essential that potential potential buyers understand her motivation before before they purchase her work. Although consumers consumers are welcome to interpret her work as they see it, she said sharing her intent bathrooms.

I’ve been struck by how enthusiastically enthusiastically the public responds when, after a concert concert at Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival Festival across the street at Alice Tally Hall, complimentary complimentary wine is offered in its beautifully renovated lobby. People linger to talk, and even mingle with the musicians who drop by. This could be the norm at Geffen Hall, too. Audiences stand to benefit from the renovation. renovation. Another beneficiary will be Jaap van Zweden, now in his second season as the Philharmonic’s music director. Ms. Borda said she expected Mr. van Zweden to lead the orchestra when the hall reopens in March 2024 — which signals the extension of his current contract, due to end a year before before that. The announcement of the renovation happens to have come at a moment when a series of guest conductors — Mr. Salonen, Santtu-Matias Rouvali, Jakub Hrusa and Susanna Malkki among them, with Gustavo Dudamel to arrive for two weeks next month — have appeared with the Philharmonic.

But the news that he will open the new hall means that the Philharmonic is truly committing to Mr. van Zweden, who will also have to lead the orchestra through two nomadic stretches during construction. After After that, he’ll deserve our thanks — as will Ms. Borda, who has suggested that this project will be the capstone of her career. New York music lovers will owe them both big time and want to cheer their success. Maybe over a drink in the new bistro. MELANIE METZ FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES was one way for her to maintain ownership over the narrative behind her work, even long after it is out of her hands. “Ultimately, you would want your work to have a home with someone who understands understands where the work came from and what pain and concepts brought it about,” she said. Ed Maximus, 33, a visual artist based in New Jersey, is showing a photograph of four nude black women weaving their bodies together together at “Who Owns Black Art?” The picture picture represents the women owning their bodies and creating space to support each other, he said. In a way, black artists are doing doing the same thing, he added. Ashlee Thomas, the president of the Miami Miami Urban Contemporary Experience, an arts production company, said, “The best thing we can do as black people owning our culture: build the platforms ourselves.” That has been happening. Sugarcane Magazine, started in 2006, covers art from the African diaspora, and publishes a guide to black art fairs taking place around the same time as Art Basel. Art Africa Miami, a fair showcasing artists of African descent that runs during Art Basel, began in 2011. Prizm Art Fair, which features the works of artists from the African diaspora, is in its seventh year. Some black art enthusiasts view these endeavors as a way to build an ecosystem that is beneficial to black artists and black consumers. They provide an entry entry point for people to learn about works and building a market for the artists, said Mikhaile Solomon, the founder and director of Prizm. “You create an experience around them and a narrative around them that creates value,” Ms. Solomon said of black artworks. “And you encourage people to participate in that.” Storm Ascher, 25, started Superposition Gallery last year after graduating from the School of Visual Arts in New York with a degree degree in visual critical studies. Her traveling gallery, which has produced seven shows, grew in part out of discussions that she and her friends were having about the challenges challenges of breaking into the industry as people people of color. They talked about the difficulty of getting residencies, gallery representation representation and curating opportunities. And they figured, why wait around for others to bet on them when they could bet on themselves, themselves, said Ms. Ascher, who is also exhibiting exhibiting at “Who Owns Black Art?” “We’re young, we’re black and we’re doing doing all these things,” she said. “We don’t need anyone’s help.” Left, an artist’s rendering of David Geffen Hall after the renovation.

Kois finds Delft much less hospitable than Wellington, though that is likely because the family chose as its base a neighborhood without a lot of children and sent their daughters to a school with limited instruction in English. The bit of local culture that he and Alia try to adopt there is the poldermodel — the Dutch art of enlisting everyone in group decisions. They take this up while withstanding the withering anger of Lyra, an 11-year-old who (understandably) (understandably) is not happy about a prolonged cultural exchange that involves limited screen time and a scarcity of books. The family then go to Costa Rica — another jaw-dropping place — where they fail to penetrate local culture, and finally finally land in Hays, Kan., to sample the cultural conformity of a place where everybody knows everybody else’s business. business. The settings are beside the point, though. The most dramatic dramatic moments of this story come in Kois’s description of his relationship with Lyra, who contributes more passages to the book than any other family member except Kois. Alia and their younger child, Harper, are consistently portrayed portrayed as helpful, productive, energetic and positive, while Lyra comes across as a complicated person who constantly constantly challenges her father. In an endnote she says that his representation of her has been too negative, but any reader who is a parent will recognize in his depiction the grudging admiration you feel for a child who regularly outwits outwits you. The places Kois traveled seem incidental not only because because of the outsize role of the dynamic with Lyra. Kois only glancingly mentions racism and the gaping chasm between between ethnic and religious minorities and whites in New Zealand, for instance, a decision that seems questionable given the mass shooting by a white supremacist in Christchurch Christchurch this year. Kois questions the Dutch view of its society society as tolerant and similarly laments the homogeneity of Hays, but generally keeps current issues at bay. His depiction depiction of the gentrification of Costa Rica by privileged Americans Americans who settle there is one exception. Kois views travel primarily as a means of transforming his own life rather than as a way to uncover the outside world; this book is an antidote to the documentarian approach approach that now pervades much travel writing. Unlike Theroux and others, Kois does not present a mediated view of the places he lives over the year. He fills the frame, ready for a selfie. for a bit of a palate cleanser, a tasting menu approach to travel can be found in 1,000 places to see before you die: The World as You’ve Never Seen It Before (Artisan, 532 pp., $50), a new, glossy coffee-table edition of the 2003 book by Patricia Patricia Schultz. Back when the book was initially published, social media had not yet supplanted travel narratives, and the idea of a bucket list conjured images of far-flung places rather than calculations of your carbon footprint. “But does the world need another ‘1,000 Places’ book?” Schultz asks in the introduction, anticipating the question from readers. Her answer is, of course, yes, and the images on the pages that follow make her case. The most notable feature of the book is the absence of people and current events. Oh, there are some people in the images but none are named, and none are trying to cross a border or fighting with their tween. This carefully curated collection of images invites you to dive in, not to transform your life, not to understand the world, but simply simply to gaze at pretty pictures away from your screen. The photography is interesting but not so interesting that it makes you rethink a place. This is the comfort food of travel travel books. It’s true we don’t need another spread on Paris, but, boy, the Arc de Triomphe does look wonderful in that light, and so do Santorini and the red sand dunes of the Namib Desert. There are helpful tips throughout: Each caption bears useful advice under a “Must Do” heading but this is no guidebook, and you’re not going to read all those captions. This book is meant to inspire wanderlust in anybody who needs an actual getaway. If you’re living in a bubble, this book will keep you there. If you’re not, this book will sweep you off your feet, gently. the best travel writing doesn’t take a ham-handed look at the world, nor does it try to escape it. It’s simply intended to make you feel so lost that you gaze up in surprise that you’re still in your living room. For that, try the splendid SURFACING (Penguin, 247 pp., paper, $17), a book of essays by the Scottish poet Kathleen Jamie. Her spare prose about life along the 60th parallel evokes the sound, smell and feel of the Alaskan tundra and then, in another essay, the Scottish Scottish coast. Elsewhere, she ventures to her past, to a trip to Tibet she made as a young woman. Jamie’s crisp language places you in a near-meditative state. Expect to hear the crunch of gravel, to squint as figures figures emerge on a nearly blank horizon and to smell the musky air of an enclosure meant to store fish centuries ago. Jamie starts off in an archaeological dig in Quinhagak, a Yup’ik village in Alaska, where summer means that the detritus of the people who lived there 500 years ago can be dislodged from the thawing ground. As these items surface, surface, so do connections to the past. Words that had threatened threatened to become obsolete are passed down as elders recognize recognize them. The renewed focus on the past helps remove the stigma that non-European culture once held. These objects — and Yup’ik culture — aren’t the only things that seem to surface. The land does too: “The delta A sand dune in the Namib Desert. was barely a landscape at all,” Jamie writes, “more like a waterscape into which some land had been released.” The water and the light — a persistent presence, nearly separate separate characters — constantly shift the shape of reality. The people she meets notice, she writes, then they speak. As a writer she does the same. Jamie reaches no grand conclusions about the Yup’ik and thankfully does not attempt to force them into a thesis that she conceived before she arrived. She says that she was trying hard not to expect anything, and we are all rewarded as she steadily reveals their world. It’s one in which the land is a collective backyard, where hunting for meat and gathering berries are pastimes as well as necessities. The Links of Noltland in Orkney, Scotland, is the site of a second grand resurfacing effort: Jamie joins Hazel Moore and Graeme Wilson, who are leading a dig of a settlement believed to be 5,000 years old. The Scottish landscape is less otherworldly than the tundra, and so are the people who accompany her. The dig exhumes the ghosts of Jamie’s Jamie’s Neolithic forebears, and the local settlements reveal familiar rituals. At one point as Jamie accompanies an organic organic farmer, she realizes that people millenniums ago were standing in the same spot, thinking similar thoughts. The spiral design on some of the recovered objects takes on new meaning, suggesting that time is a circle, not a straight line. This passage of time and these old ghosts give Jamie the thematic impetus to shift from travel narrative to memoir. The ending is less taut than the beginning. Still, as she exhumes exhumes the memories of her mother and grandmother, the spiral continues, with a daughter leaving home, the loss of her father and then her reckoning with her own cancer diagnosis. diagnosis. She leaves off in woods. And long after closing the book, you’ll linger there with her too. □",12/8/2019,"('depiction', 'of', 'the')","('costa', 'rica', 'by')",[' His depiction depiction of the gentrification of Costa Rica by privileged Americans Americans who settle there is one exception.'], His depiction depiction of the gentrification of Costa Rica by privileged Americans Americans who settle there is one exception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
201,2747982970,"New Stores Add Their Own Glitter to Las Vegas Developers clamor for retail space along the Strip to offer shoppers one-of-a-kind experiences. Square Feet By JOE GOSE Five years ago, Eli Gindi, a New York businessman, learned that part of the Showcase Mall on the Las Vegas Strip was up for sale. His interest piqued, he informally toured the property a few weeks later while in town for business. Until then, Las Vegas had not been on Mr. Gindi's investment radar. That changed during his trip. A mass of humanity crowded into stores for Coca- Cola, M&Ms and Adidas, as well as souvenir shops, T-shirt vendors, tour booths, tattoo parlors and peddlers of giant margaritas. A time-share sales man told Mr. Gindi that he paid S50.000 a month to rent a table at the mall. When his business associates wanted to leave the mall, he hesitated. ""I said, 'I'm not leaving until I buy this,' said Mr. Gindi, a co-founder of Gindi Capital, which invests in real estate, retailing and other assets. I had never seen an opportunity like it."" His timing could not have been bet ter. Over the last few years, retailers have been clamoring for storefront space along the Strip, hoping to cap ture the attention of some 42 million global visitors annually by providing one-of-a-kind experiences. It is a departure from the Strip's primary retailing model of containing stores and restaurants inside casinos, a trend that the Simon Property Group established nearly 30 years ago with the development of the wildly success ful Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. ""In the past, the safest bet was to be in the casino because that's where the traffic was and having that identity with the casino made sense,"" said Zack Hussain, a senior associate with CBRE in Las Vegas. ""But today, street-front retail is thought to be best, and the biggest challenge on the Strip is meet ing the demand for space. We're start ing to see some gentrification of street- front properties."" Since paying S145 million for part of the Showcase Mall four years ago, Gindi Capital has acquired the rest of it and nearby properties to control some 2,000 feet of frontage on Las Vegas Boulevard South between West Tropi- cana and East Harmon Avenues. Gindi Capital completed its fifth and latest acquisition on the block this year, pay ing S172 million for 9.5 acres, where it intends to develop a 300,000-square- foot shopping, dining and entertain ment project Mr. Gindi said he had bought out several tenants to make way for Ameri can Eagle and T-Mobile stores, as well as Designer Shoe Warehouse. The first Burlington and Target stores on the Strip are under construction north of the Showcase Mall on the former site of a Smith Wollensky steakhouse, which Gindi Capital bought in 2017. FlyOver Las Vegas, a virtual reality experience, will open in a closed movie theater in 2021 after a makeover cost ing some S35 million, he said. Demand for Las Vegas retail space stands in contrast to most markets in the United States, even along tradi tional high-traffic streets. Many retail ers are struggling to adapt to market changes, including the growth of e- commerce, the decline of large depart ment stores and a growing preference for engaging experiences that tran scend the routine shopping trip. The liquidation of Barneys New York is the latest in a number of recent retailer capitulations, which include the closing of Gap, Tommy Hilfiger. Lord Taylor and Polo Ralph Lauren stores in New York, for example. Fail ing retailers have closed stores in Las Vegas, too, but many brands, including Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Tiffany, still occupy multiple locations in casinos along the Strip, Mr. Hussain said. Mr. Gindi attributes some of the consequences in New York to a surge in lease rates Barneys' rent roughly doubled to S30 million for its 275,000- square-foot flagship store on Madison Avenue but he expects that corri dors like Madison and Fifth Avenues will overcome their retail challenges when rates decline. Still, among the differences that set the Strip apart from other well-known high-traffic streets, rent is one. The Strip has only about one-third of the annual traffic of Times Square, said Michael Hirschfeld, vice chair man of Jones Lang LaSalle in New York. Average costs to lease space on the Strip are S250 to S300 per square foot, compared with 51,500 to 51,800 for prime Times Square space, he added. He also pointed out that New York residents and office workers make up a sizable portion of the daily pedestrian traffic along Manhattan's retail streets. ""In Las Vegas, the population changes every three and a half days. and people come from all over the world,"" said Mr. Hirschfeld, who is working with Mr. Gindi on his Las Vegas project ""These are people who want to be in a fun environment and who want to experience and do things that they can't do when they go back home to St. Louis or Leon, France."" He added, ""A lot of retail is evolving to what Vegas already is."" The focus on retailing along the Strip coincides with a smaller empha sis on gambling among younger gener ations, which have gravitated toward other forms of experience-based enter tainment. The share of gambling reve nue on the Strip has declined for 35 years, dropping to 34.3 percent in 2018 from 58.6 percent in 1984, according to the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Over the same period, food, beverage, retail and entertainment spending rose to almost 38 percent from 25.2 percent. Recognizing this change, casinos in recent years have created outdoor entertainment districts to leverage Strip traffic, including Park MGM, an MGM Resorts development across the street from the Showcase Mall. Last December, the Italian food hall and marketplace Eataly opened its sixth United States location in Park MGM, and sales have matched those of its other operations despite the store's slightly smaller size, said Nicola Farinetti, Eataly's chief executive. ""We quickly understood that Eataly would be a great fit for the Vegas market because we cater toward both the gastronomic and entertainment aspects of the city,"" he said. ""We've had to learn to accommodate so many guests at once after concerts, shows and other happenings in the area, but that has been the fun of it"" Similarly, many retailers and restau rant operators are opening flagships destination outlets with prominent, modern features along the Strip to provide services, merchandise and experiences that shoppers can find only in select markets. American Eagle's two-story anchor store on the Showcase Mall's southern end, for example, allows customers to person alize their clothing in the store and is wrapped in digital awnings that adver tise the brand 24 hours a day. American Eagle already operates in the Fashion Show Mall on the Strip's northern end, but that store serves primarily local customers, said Andrew McLean, chief commercial officer for the parent company, American Eagle Outfitters. It opened the Showcase Mall store to cater to a broader customer base, he added. Aerie, the retailer's intimate apparel brand, also opened on two floors at the property. ""As we looked at our detailed analy sis, it became apparent that this was an opportunity that was just too good to pass on,"" Mr. McLean said. ""It presents our brands to their fullest potential and creates a strong experience that customers carry home.""

351,2748131277,"Race Matters A collection of essays from an eloquent chronicler of black life. By LAURETTA CHARLTON ACCORDING TO A RUMOR in New Orleans, an old family restaurant used to give a free ham to any police officer who killed a black person in the line of duty. The restaurant stopped doing this only in the 1980s, the story goes, when a black police officer came in to claim his ham. The lesson: In white America, a black man in a uniform is... still just a black man. Observations like this one are at the heart of ""Busted in New York,"" a new essay collection by the novelist and essayist Dar- ryl Pinckney. Pinckney has written for The New York Review of Books for decades, and most of the 25 essays here appeared there first. In his two novels, Pinckney fo cused on the interior lives of his black char acters in settings including Berlin, Chicago and Indianapolis, where Pinckney was raised. Here, he reveals himself to be a skillful chronicler of black experience in lit erary criticism, reportage and biography. In the essays, written between 1994 and 2018, Pinckney reports from the streets of Ferguson, Mo., in the aftermath of the death of Michael Brown. He traces the ways in which the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's fiery sermons nearly derailed Barack Oba- ma's presidential campaign in 2008. He charts, block by block, the gentrification of Harlem, and visits a recovering New Or leans after Hurricane Katrina, where he tells the story of the ham. In ""How 1 Got Over,"" he reflects on black expatriates from Richard Wright to James Baldwin, Pinckney's lodestar who left for Europe to escape Jim Crow, only to witness racism by another name: Islamophobia. But what stands out in this collection are the moments when Pinckney turns his eye toward the contradictions of the black bourgeoisie, of which he is a longtime member. Pinckney grew up in a middle- class family, in the 1960s, when being black and middle class often meant being ac cused of ""trying to act white,"" he writes. His mother and father were civil rights foot soldiers who in their spare time would do things like sue their hometown police de partment to force it to desegregate. His fa ther ""hawked N.A.A.C.P. memberships in airport men's rooms."" His mother's cousin was lynched in 1931, while a student at At lanta University. Pinckney's parents make appearances in several essays in the book, and even when they don't, he finds ways to make their spiritual presence tangible. In the ti tle essay, he considers just how much has changed from his parents' generation to his own as he recalls being arrested on the Lower East Side with two female friends a banker and a scientist for smoking a joint on the street in Rudy Giuliani's New York. I nj ustice had only to ring their door bell, and they were off to the poorhouse,"" he writes of his parents. ""And here was frivolous me letting a white man put me in handcuffs for something other than pro test."" A hazard of growing up black and middle class is the misguided belief that money and education will provide refuge from dis crimination. Pinckney shows how those presumptions are often manifestations of internalized racism, and that even he is not immune to them. In his essay on Ferguson, he describes being afraid of two young black men on the street who turned out to be peaceful protesters. ""I had to ask my self, and not for the first time, when did I become afraid of black youth?"" Similarly, Pinckney wonders if the suc cessful black men who complain of racial profiling in Charles Ogletree's book ""The Presumption of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class and Crime in America,"" written after Gates was ar rested by a white police officer while trying to enter his own home, knew they sounded elitist and out of touch. Though their griev ances are troubling, he writes, ""one quickly understands the irritation of the black working poor with the outrage of black professionals at the social indignities they encounter. There are worse things than not having one's high social status ac knowledged by whites."" Not all of the essays have aged well. In ""Dreams From Obama,"" from 2008, Pinck ney writes that ""however unpopular it has been as a public policy, affirmative action has succeeded in integrating the middle class,"" a statement that rings hollow now, especially in light of the recent college ad missions scandals. His prose can also seem belabored and overwrought. Writing about Louis Farrakhan in 1995, in the after math of the Million Man March in Wash ington, he notes, ""By locating disunity in the historical conspiracy of whites against blacks, he showed that acclaiming him was not a personal but a collective triumph over those who did not want to see blacks united."" The crown jewel of this book is ""Banjo,"" an essay that first appeared last year in the literary magazine Salmagundi. In it, Pinck ney pinpoints a devastating irony of grow ing up in a privileged, intellectual milieu like his: Frequent conversations with his parents about race became a way for the family to deflect real intimacy. ""To talk about the black condition made conversa tion seem personal,"" he writes, ""a way of not talking about myself while seeming to."" The pressure to live up to his parents' ex pectations led to its own kind of oppres sion, one he sought to escape by traveling to Europe but addresses head on in this es say, which captures his journey toward self-discovery. Through race, Pinckney im plies, we hide from each other and our selves. 1 1 BUSTED IN NEW YORK And Other Essays By Darryl Pinckney 384 pp. Fartai, Straus Giroux. $30.

The speech could also double as a prompt for a full-throated debate on the left about the complex interplay between representation-based identity politics and other political goals. Many activists would agree with the young speaker and say that a movement on behalf of black lives should be led by black voices and focus on the issues facing black people. Elected politicians might cringe at being sidelined and argue that a member of the City Council, especially one as far left as Sawant, belongs in the movement. Indelicate Indelicate Marxists might argue that the identity identity of speakers should not matter and that the only meaningful action would be to leverage the movement to tax Amazon. They might point out that it has driven up Seattle rents, which in turn has led to rapid gentrification of black neighborhoods; neighborhoods; action against Amazon could secure universal victory. The relevance of such debates, and even more so their resolution, is unclear. These sorts of deliberations are not new. They were on the minds of the Combahee Combahee River Collective, a coalition of black queer feminist radicals who first coined the term “identity politics” in 1974. The C.R.C., whose origins have been revisited recently in Asad Haider’s “Mistaken Identity” Identity” and Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor’s “How Amount that would be raised annually by the Tax Amazon legislation, according to its sponsors, Kshama Sawant and Tammy J. Morales of the Seattle City Council: $500 million We Got Free,” grew out of dissatisfaction with the narrow focus of the National Black Feminist Organization, which in turn had left the broader, white-led feminist movement. movement. The C.R.C. believed that what set it apart from those two groups was its economic economic analysis, which called for an end to “bourgeois-feminist” politics. “Solidarity,” as Taylor points out, was not “subsuming your struggles to help someone else” but rather strengthening “the political commitments commitments from other groups by getting them to recognize how the different struggles were related to each other and connected under capitalism.” The C.R.C.’s vision of identity politics bears little resemblance to the modern",7/5/2020,"('led', 'to', 'rapid')","('black', 'neighborhoods', 'neighborhoods')","[' They might point out that it has driven up Seattle rents, which in turn has led to rapid gentrification of black neighborhoods; neighborhoods; action against Amazon could secure universal victory.']", They might point out that it has driven up Seattle rents which in turn has led to rapid gentrification of black neighborhoods neighborhoods action against Amazon could secure universal victory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
180,2449338520,"Vows WEDDINGS Julie Oh, Shauna Perlman After the After-Parties, Act 1, Scene 1 Shauna Lauren Perlman and Julie Sujin Oh were on familiar turf as they went from party to party after the 2014 Tony Awards ceremony at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. “We were both in work mode, but able to let the background noise disappear as we engaged in a genuine warm conversation,” said Ms. Perlman, Perlman, then a New York talent agent, who now focuses on representing actors at Creative Artists Artists Agency in Los Angeles. She graduated from Northwestern. Ms. Perlman (right), 33, was at the Tonys to support her clients, while Ms. Oh, 32, was there as part of her job as a vice president for production production and development at the former Weinstein Company. She is now a film producer working in Manhattan on the Netflix musical drama film directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, “Tick, Tick... BOOM!” She graduated from the University of California, San Diego. She and Ms. Perlman had crossed paths at screenings and industry events in the months before the Tonys, and at some point had exchanged exchanged numbers. Ms. Perlman texted Ms. Oh after the show on that June 8, 2014, about meeting meeting with her and her father, Lee H. Perlman, who is on the board of the American Theater Wing, at the Plaza hotel after-party. “I just know I never met anyone as interesting as her,” Ms. Oh said. After Ms. Perlman’s father left around midnight, midnight, they took in a couple of more parties, and ended the evening as many do at the after-after party at the Carlyle Hotel. “Some people stay until sunrise,” Ms. Oh said. “We stayed until 4 or 5.” Later they shared a car that dropped Ms. Perlman off in the Flatiron district, and then took Ms. Oh to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. They stayed in touch over the next month. “It didn’t immediately resonate that it could be romantic,” said Ms. Perlman, who until then only dated men. In late July, Ms. Perlman, in her mind as a romantic gesture, invited Ms. Oh to a movie screening on the Upper West Side. “I didn’t know if it was a date,” Ms. Oh said, “but I was hoping.” After the movie they each had a glass of wine outdoors at a restaurant across from Lincoln Center, and later in a cab they had their first kiss. Samantha Fishbein, Avi Sage Finding a Fellow Deadhead in the Pool Credit the Grateful Dead for the union of Samantha Fishbein and Avi Sage. Ms. Fishbein, 31, grew up in Roslyn, N.Y, listening to the Grateful Dead and seeing shows with her parents, Ilene and Dr. Benjamin Fishbein. Mr. Sage had a similar experience experience with his parents, Alison and Michael Sage. “I find I can always look deeper into the lyrics when I hear the songs,” said Ms. Fishbein, a founder and the chief creative officer of Betches Media in New York. In late 2015, Ms. Fishbein’s friend, Ali Kor, invited her to a Friday night Shabbat dinner at the Sages’ home in Passaic, N.J. Ms. Fishbein was religious at the time, as was the Sage family. As it happens, the Sages had a son named Avi, now 26. Ms. Fishbein, who was single, thought he was cute, but she wasn’t looking for romance. “Ali and I joked about how he had a crush on me, and I said he’s way too young and probably too religious for me,” she said. In fact, Mr. Sage was just out of a relationship and not looking for anything. But he thought she was cool. “She was energetic, really interesting and had a different business — this online media business,” business,” said Mr. Sage, an investment director at Old City Capital, an investment firm in New York. In addition to shared values, they discovered they both had affinity for the Grateful Dead. “I thought it was unique to find a Deadhead in the religious community,” she said. “It’s not super common.” Ms. Fishbein returned for a Passover Seder a few months later, and then Michael Sage invited her and Ms. Kor to use their swimming pool the next day. Although Ms. Fishbein isn’t the sort of person to accept an invitation to a relative stranger’s pool, something told her go to. (Actually, (Actually, it was Ms. Kor.) So she did. Mr. Sage was pleased. “That’s when I realized she was different and I kind of liked it,” he said. She was becoming less religious, and she learned that although he had grown up in an observant Jewish home, he was no longer as devout. That’s when they connected on a deeper level. “It’s really important because of how we understand understand each other and align on how we feel about being religious,” Ms. Fishbein said. “I really get his background and how he grew up.” They stayed in touch through the summer and fall, and in October 2016, at Mr. Sage’s urging, his MICHELLE BELLER “I was really scared leading up to it,” Ms. Perlman said. “Once it happened, I had this feeling of, wow, I made the right choice.” In April 2016, they moved in together in TriBeCa, TriBeCa, and about a year and a half later they moved to Los Angeles when Ms. Perlman began working at the Creative Artists Agency. In May 2019, Ms. Oh used Ms. Perlman’s birthday birthday as an excuse to get her to New York, and decided to propose during a helicopter ride early on the day of her so-called birthday party at the Fleur Room in Chelsea, which proved to be a perfectly-timed cover for an engagement party. Ms. Oh came prepared for the noisy helicopter ride with a dozen index cards that she pulled out over the Hudson, which led up to the ultimate one that said, “Will you marry me?” In December, Ms. Perlman proposed over dinner on a beach at sunset in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, Mexico, and they began discussing wedding plans as the pandemic set in. “I’m an extreme introvert and Shauna is an extreme extrovert,” Ms. Oh said. “When we started thinking of our dream wedding we had different ideas. We were able to do a small marriage ceremony and she gets to throw the biggest party.” They were married Aug. 11 by Rachel Hoffman, a deputy commissioner of civil marriage, on the lawn of City Hall in Santa Barbara, Calif. ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY FELIX FEYGIN/FRED MARCUS STUDIO father invited her to see a Dead cover band in Brooklyn. After, the couple went out to Salvation Tacos in Manhattan, and spent hours talking on the roof. “She’s energetic, witty, and really damn smart,” Mr. Sage said. “She’s not haughty and arrogant. People who have seen success early in their life tend to become very aggressive on where they think their value is. She has a lot of humility.” They slowly went from being texting buddies to more. By March 2017, they were dating. “It was just a natural evolution,” she said. “Avi has a seemingly limitless capacity for love and is so patient, understanding and positive.” He proposed on March 4, 2019 — the second anniversary of their first date — on the ski slopes of Mountain Creek, in Vernon, N.J. They were married Aug. 23 in Mr. Sage’s parents’ parents’ backyard, before 45 friends and family members. Rabbi Reuven Ibragimov officiated. (As with so many couples, this was a Plan B wedding; originally, they were supposed to marry on April 19 in Florida, but the coronavirus pandemic scrapped that plan.) The couples walked down the aisle to the “Circle of Life” from “The Lion King,” accompanied accompanied by their 4-year-old Boston terrier, Bruce Bader Ginsburg. After the ceremony, classic rock played overhead: Springsteen, Petty, Zeppelin, the Stones and, of course, the Grateful Dead. When “U.S. Blues,” Mr. Sage’s favorite Dead tune, came on, they jumped into the pool. ABBY ELLIN Lisa Jacobs, Mark Kerstens Sharing a Weekend, and His License Plate Number Dr. Lisa Jacobs had low expectations for online dating. So low in fact, that after matching on Tinder in December December 2017 with Marinus Kerstens, who goes by Mark, she made sure to eat dinner before their first date, thinking it would be for only a drink. Mr. Kerstens showed up ready for a full meal. “I was new to this whole online dating thing,” said Mr. Kerstens, 49, who is the senior director of fleet solutions for Rivian, an electric vehicle manufacturer manufacturer in Palo Alto, Calif. “So we came into this with different expectations right out of the gate.” It was Mr. Kerstens’s adventurous nature that drew Dr. Jacobs, 36, to his profile in the first place. So when he asked her if she wanted to spend the weekend with him at Lake Tahoe, after only three weeks of knowing each other, she agreed. But she snapped a picture of his license plate while getting getting in his car on the drive up to Tahoe. She sent it to her friends, joking that if she wasn’t back at work on Monday, they should look for her. Dr. Jacobs is an adjunct clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, the assistant director of the Pegasus Physician Writers at Stanford and a psychiatrist in private practice in Menlo Park, Calif. “Clearly none of that happened,” Mr. Kerstens said. “And then it was just like adventure after adventure adventure after that,” Dr. Jacobs said. In March 2018, only a few months after they started dating, Mr. Kerstens’s company suddenly transferred him to Amsterdam. Mr. Kerstens is from the Netherlands, but had been living abroad for 24 years, 17 of which he had spent in the United States. It just so happened that for the first year ever, the child psychiatry fellowship at Stanford, Stanford, where Dr. Jacobs was a fellow, would allow fellows to spend a month doing undirected scholarly scholarly work. It meant that Dr. Jacobs had a whole month she could spend away from the hospital, and she decided to spend it in Amsterdam. The two traveled around Europe. But when Dr. Jacobs returned home, her friends were surprised to hear they had broken up. Mr. Kerstens thought the distance would be unsustainable for their relationship, but he couldn’t couldn’t stop talking about her. Finally his sister and brother-in-law sat him down and talked some sense into him. Chelsea Connor, Will Carey The Perfect Mix: Politics and Comedy When Chelsea Connor first saw Will Carey, all 6 feet 7 inches of him, in June 2014, he was onstage at the comedy club Caroline’s on Broadway, discussing the gentrification of the chopped cheese sandwich. “I’m a Brooklyn girl and I’ve been eating that chopped cheese sandwich since I was a kid, so I could instantly relate,” said Ms. Connor, 31, the director of media relations and communications for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, a New York-based labor union and division division of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. “He did a lot of observational humor and had so many funny bits that just got to me,” she said. Mr. Carey, 34, whose height helped him notice Ms. Connor sitting with friends on a crowded evening, was a lot more observational than she first thought. When his standup routine ended, he walked off the stage and made a beeline for her and introduced himself. “I just saw her and thought she was very beautiful,” beautiful,” he said. “When I started talking to her, I thought she was particularly smart and interesting, interesting, and I wanted to know more about her.” He asked if he could escort her to the subway station, and Ms. Connor, then living with her parents in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, accepted his offer. “She gave me her phone number and then told me I could call her in a month,” said Mr. Carey, then living in Woodside, Queens. Ms. Connor had been a spokeswoman for the campaign of Adriano Espaillat, who was running against Representative Charles B. Rangel in a Democratic primary in New York. She explained to Mr. Carey that she was too busy to do anything that month but focus on the election. “I knew nothing about local politics at the time,” Mr. Carey said, “so I was trying to follow the debates on local newscasts and various websites. websites. When I saw that her candidate had lost, I texted her to say I was sorry about that.” Ms. Connor remembered Mr. Carey’s text as “the very first I received the morning after the campaign.” “It’s 7 in the morning and I look at my phone and it says, ‘Will the comedian,’ which is how I had saved his name,” said Ms. Connor, who graduated graduated from N.Y.U. and received a master’s degree in elections and campaign management from Fordham. “It took me a few seconds to remember who he was,” she said. They were soon back in touch, and Ms. Connor TERESA MANSBACH “They were like, what are you doing here,” Mr. Kerstens said. “Get on a fricking plane, go to San Francisco and fix this. Win her back.” He did, and six weeks later, Mr. Kerstens was back in San Francisco. He proposed to Dr. Jacobs on the beach of Lake Tahoe in December 2018. The couple had been planning to get married May 16 at Hortus Botanicus, the Amsterdam botanical gardens, but had to postpone because of the coronavirus. A few months later, when wildfires wildfires started to burn through swathes of Northern California, the couple’s spirit was put to the test when the county sheriff knocked on their door and told them their Redwood City home was in the mandatory evacuation zone. They had to pack what they could carry and leave as quickly as possible. They left for Verona, N. J., where Dr. Jacobs’s parents live. And although they hadn’t planned on it, decided to marry Aug. 30 in Dr. Jacobs’s parents’ parents’ backyard. Shira Bortniker, a minister with American Marriage Ministries and a friend of the bride, officiated. The couple said that the chaotic past few months have only brought them closer together. “I realized that he’s incredibly resilient, and a different level of supportive than what I imagined, imagined, and that my life was so much better and easier than if I had to weather such things without without him,” Dr. Jacobs said. EMMA GRILLO MINDY TUCKER set up a first date at a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan with Mr. Carey, who now works in content operations at Stitcher Radio, a podcasting network in New York. He is still a stand-up comedian, comedian, as well as a producer and host of the podcast “Between Awesome and Disaster.” “I had only spoken to her in person that one time at Carolines, but I had a better conversation with her than I had ever had with any other woman,” said Mr. Carey, who graduated from Towson University. “There was a certain, driven stick-to-itiveness about her that had obviously come from working in the world of politics,” he said, “and I found that very attractive.” They began dating steadily. In October 2018, they took a trip to Southeast Asia. On a rainy day, they climbed Elephant Mountain in Taipei, Taiwan, Taiwan, and after arriving at the summit cliff, Mr. Carey proposed, as fellow climbers around them began to cheer. They were married Sept. 9 in an outdoor ceremony ceremony at Gantry State Park in Long Island City, Queens, before five guests, including their officiant, officiant, Samuel Zelitch, who became a minister of American Marriage Ministries for the event. The couple had originally planned to marry May 23 at the Brooklyn Cider House with 178 guests, but the coronavirus forced them to cancel. VINCENT M.

An exploitation film that proceeds as if it were a solemn memorial, “The Secrets We Keep” doesn’t do right by the Holocaust history it tile, to his inquiries. Interspersed with his uneasy here-andnow here-andnow are flashbacks to his childhood, in which sounds of menacing gunfire and celebratory celebratory fireworks become emblematic. Ebullience and deprivation ooze into each other and become inextricable. Gerima’s challenging, engrossing filmmaking filmmaking style is measured, simultaneously realistic and impressionistic. What’s out of the frame is often as important, if not more important, than what’s in the frame. As when Jay, climbing out of his basement in the dead of night, sees an old buddy passing by; through the grate of a fence they have a fraught conversation, made more so by the invokes — or much else. In smalltown smalltown America around the turn of the 1960s, Maja (Noomi Rapace), a Romanian housewife, spots a stranger whom she believes participated in the assault and murder of a group of women that included her and her sister near the end of World War II. But after kidnapping the man and holding him at gunpoint, with plans to execute him in a pre-dug grave, Maja loses her nerve and brings him home. There, she imprisons him in the basement and demands a confession. The man (Joel Kinnaman) says his name is Thomas, that he is Swiss, and that Maja must be confused about his identity. (“North by Northwest,” in which Cary Grant is mistaken for someone he is not, is one of two titles glimpsed on a marquee, in what may be the movie’s idea of a thematically relevant shout-out.) Maja’s husband (Chris Messina), a doctor, doesn’t know what to believe, especially since Maja has never revealed her wartime experiences before. The claustrophobic scenario cuts mighty close to Ariel Dorfman’s play “Death and the Maiden,” the main difference being that Maja, when not pouring liquor down her prisoner's throat or severing his finger, befriends his sleepless wife (Amy Seimetz), who has her own questions about her husband. Despite the occasional flashy camera move, Yuval Adler (last year’s “The Operative”) directs with an apparent determination to remove color and light from his imagery. The police and the neighbors demonstrate impresHi impresHi ■•'•>:< Obinna Nwachukwu as a screenwriter who returns to Washington from Los Angeles, where he was trying to get a film project off the ground. sight of the blue lights of an unseen police car bouncing off their faces. In another scene, Jay walks through the woods with a friend, Dion (Jamal Graham). They reminisce about old times amid this greenery, but it’s soon clear that he and Dion are actually in the visiting room of a jail, and that the restful environment is in Jay’s imagination. Jay’s confusion and rage over the gentrification gentrification of Q Street and beyond can’t help but spill over. Gerima layers the soundtrack with overheard conversations of utterly clueless white people, making any viewer empathize with the protagonist’s anger and impotence. sive cluelessness, without which the unearned ending wouldn’t make sense. BEN KENIGSBERG THE NEST Rated R. Sex, marital fights and the pitiless treatment of a horse. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes. In theaters. Consult Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines before watching movies in theaters. “The Nest” is the first feature Sean Durkin has written and directed since his formidable debut, the cult-detox drama “Martha Marcy May Marlene” (2011). The long wait burdens the new movie with high expectations. expectations. In contrast to the dreamlike subjectivity of “Martha Marcy,” “The Nest” is a coldly observational observational study of a ReaganThatcher-era ReaganThatcher-era family divided in ambitions, nationality and — with respect to the children — parentage. parentage. The British Rory (Jude Law), a rapacious financier in the United States, talks his American wife, Allison (Carrie Coon), into moving to England with their kids (Oona Roche and Charlie Shotwell). Without consulting her, he splurges on a farm mansion in Surrey whose ludicrously large and creepy grounds have little use beyond projecting ultraconspicuous ultraconspicuous consumption. Allison resents Rory’s paternalism paternalism and British society’s encouragement encouragement of it, and Coon embodies an extraordinary range of selfloathing, selfloathing, simmering anger and doubt. Durkin smartly leans on her performance, in a long take, for instance, that observes her face as she realizes Rory misled her about his job offer’s origins. Law, though, is miscast. He has the smarm but not the charm of a compulsive grifter, even a hapless one. In a grimly funny scene, he unsuccessfully pitches his estranged estranged mother (Anne Reid) on meeting her grandson, now 10. In technique, “The Nest” is severe but unimpeachable, from the carefully paralleled shots of Law awaking Coon at different houses to the Cesca chairs that subtly signify comfort (and time period) at family meals, notably the breakfast scenes at the beginning beginning and end. If Durkin’s writing doesn’t always match his formal flair, “The Nest” has a bracing economy, cramming a lot into tight quarters.

3604,2474850624,"Inside the List ELISABETH EGAN ‘This is our work as humans humans in this time: to build good soil/ Pass It On People in the publishing world love to speculate about what will “move the needle” on book sales. Enormous Enormous marketing and publicity budgets help. So does an author interview with a major media outlet or the benediction of an influential club. It helps if the author has a track record as a best seller or is a household name or has an interesting story to tell about another person who is a household name. But the most elusive needle-mover — the Holy Grail in an industry industry that put the Holy Grail on the best-seller list (hi, Dan Brown) — is “word of mouth” book sales. This is the phenomenon whereby one reader recommends a book to another reader who recommends it to her mother who lends a copy to her co-worker who buys the book for his mother ... and so forth, until the title becomes eligible for inclusion in this column. Robin Wall Kimmerer’s essay collection, collection, “Braiding Sweetgrass,” is a perfect perfect example of crowd-inspired traction. The book was published in 2013 by Milkweed Milkweed Editions. It did not have a largescale largescale marketing campaign, according to Kimmerer, a botanist and member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, who describes describes the book as “an invitation to celebrate the gifts of the earth.” On Feb. 9, 2020, it first appeared at No. 14 on the paperback nonfiction list; it is now in its 30th week, at No. 9. Kimmerer has a hunch about why her message is resonating right now: “When we’re looking at things we cherish falling apart, when inequities and injustices are so apparent, people are looking for another another way that we can be living. We need interdependence rather than independence, independence, and Indigenous knowledge has a message of valuing connection, especially especially to the humble.” This self-proclaimed “not very good digital citizen” wrote a first draft of “Braiding Sweetgrass” in purple pen on long yellow legal pads. She prefers working working outside, where she “moves between what I think of as the microscope and the telescope,” observing small things in the natural world that serve as microcosms microcosms for big ideas. For instance, Kimmerer Kimmerer explains, “The other day I was raking leaves in my garden to make compost and it made me think, This is our work as humans in this time: to build good soil in our gardens, to build good soil culturally and socially, and to create potential for the future.

Miranda. The event adds a high-profile piece of programming to the statewide statewide effort to bring the arts back after an entire year was upended by the coronavirus pandemic. The premiere will be held at the United Palace theater in the Washington Washington Heights neighborhood, where Miranda’s New York tale takes place. And for the first time in the festival’s 20-year history, organizers organizers say their opening-night selection will be screened simultaneously simultaneously across all five boroughs in multiple open-air venues, meaning that New Yorkers will be able to enjoy the film in a setting that poses relatively low risk of spreading spreading the virus. “It is such an honor to open the 20th anniversary Tribeca Festival with Tn the Heights.’ We’re so excited excited to welcome them uptown!” Miranda said in a statement. “This will be an unforgettable night at the United Palace. We can’t wait to share this musical love letter to our community, with our community, in our community.” Organizers say the 2021 Tribeca Festival, running June 9-20 and dropping “film” from its name, will be the first big movie event in North America held in person since the pandemic began. Most of last year’s film festivals, including Tribeca, were delayed, postponed, canceled or reimagined because of concerns about mass gatherings during the public health crisis.

At the same time, indoor performances have been allowed to resume in New York City with limited capacity. This month, a Broadway house opened — albeit briefly — for the first time. Still, the pandemic persists. Although Although many New Yorkers are getting getting vaccinated, virus variants have emerged, and the city continues continues to average more than 3,000 new cases per day. The premiere of “In the Heights” will probably spark some amount of joy for weary New Yorkers eager eager for a vibrant celebration of their city. Adapted from the Broadway Broadway show with a book by Quiara Alegria Hudes and music and lyrics by Miranda, the movie stars Anthony Ramos as Usnavi, a bodega bodega owner dealing with the gentrification gentrification of his Upper Manhattan neighborhood.

Nicola, the artistic director, is leaving the Off Broadway nonprofit. By ERIC GRODE As the New York theater world points toward toward reopening, one major force within its nonprofit sector — and a central figure in its often lucrative collaborations with Broadway Broadway — is preparing to walk away. James C. Nicola, the artistic director of New York Theater Workshop, announced on Friday that he would step down in June 2022. At that point, he will have spent 34 years — nearly half his life — at the Off Broadway theater, which spawned the once-in-a-lifetime hit musical “Rent” and grew under his leadership into a steady home for provocative fare by the likes of Caryl Churchill, the Five Lesbian Brothers and the director Ivo van Hove. “I’ve been around long enough to see some of my colleagues carried out of their jobs in a pine box,” Nicola, 71, said on Thursday. Thursday. “I didn’t want to go that route.” His announcement comes at a time when theaters in New York are grappling with numerous numerous internal and external pressures. Besides the protracted closures related to Covid-19, several groups of theater artists who are Black, Indigenous or people of color color have pointed out the overwhelmingly white and male demographics of their artistic artistic leadership, most notably in the “We See You, White American Theater” manifesto that came out in July. One of its demands was that theater leaders leaders should view it as “an act of service to resign” resign” if they have served in the role for more than 20 years, a benchmark that Nicola reached when George W. Bush was president. president. Nicola is the first prominent New York artistic director to announce his departure since then, and the process of replacing him will be closely watched.

He came to New York Theater Workshop in 1988 after stints in the New York Shakespeare Shakespeare Festival’s casting office and at Arena Stage in Washington. In recent years, the workshop has seen several works transfer to Broadway, including including the Tony Award-winning musicals “Once” and “Hadestown”; the acclaimed A creative leader who spent more than three decades at the theater. personal-meets-political memoir “What the Constitution Means to Me”; and “Slave Play,” which is currently nominated for 12 Tonys. (Another transfer, “Sing Street,” was two weeks away from its first preview on Broadway when the Covid-19 lockdown happened.) Nicola — who recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of “Rent,” the theater’s first Broadway transfer, with a starry online fund-raiser — says he is of two minds about the pipeline between commercial and nonprofit nonprofit theater. “There are many wonderful people in the commercial Broadway world, but I think we’ve become too dependent on their enhancement enhancement money,” Nicola said, referring to the funds that commercial Broadway producers will invest in smaller productions productions with an eye toward larger subsequent productions. “If it’s a large project and it doesn’t have commercial enhancement, it’s probably not going to happen,” he said. “And I think that’s something we as an industry need to be re41 re41 Crackerjack 42 Linguist Chomsky 43 Copies, as from a CD 44 Risky thing to do close to flight time 46 1040, e.g. 47 _blue 48 Bother 49 Some nervous responses si Latitude 53 Thanksgiving aftermath, maybe 57 Prompt 58 Aspire 59 Small sample, to Brits eo Like this clue among the Acrosses DOWN 1 Ones closest to you, informally 2 Sch. whose athletes are nicknamed the Hoos 3 Annual coll, basketball event 4 Pop s Clear sky PUZZLE BY LESLIE ROGERS i 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 19 20 ■ 21 22 23 24 25 ■ 26 27 ■ CO CN ■ 29 ■ | 30 ■ 31 32 33 34 35 ■ 36 37 ■ 38 39 ■ 40 ■ 41 ■ 42 ■ 43 44 45 ■ 46 ■ 47 48 ■ 49 50 51 52 ■ 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 6 Ranking component 7 Mathematical puzzle with movable disks 8 Snap 9 Neck problem 10 Homecomings? 11 Targets of leg raises, informally 12 Safe to skate on, say is Decorative features throughout Spain’s Alhambra palace 14 On the_ 20 One getting a big scoop? 22 Weakens Online subscriptions: Today’s puzzle and more than 9,000 past puzzles, nytimes.com/crosswords ($39.95 a year).

Until that is feasible, the theater has established established an ambitious Artistic Instigators program, connecting traditional theater artists, filmmakers and digital artists on projects that subscribers can watch in their evolving states. As Nicola envisions a postcoronavirus postcoronavirus theater landscape, he hopes theaters will learn from these innovations. “This year, we had 18,000 people view the ‘Rent 25’ gala from all over the globe,” he said. “Eighteen thousand.

1476,2537035196,"Asian-American Artists Fight Against Hate CONTINUED FROM PAGE Cl The rise of racist attacks, some of them horrifyingly lethal, has galvanized AsianAmerican AsianAmerican artists around the country. They are leveraging social media to raise awareness, awareness, gathering to protest despite the pandemic pandemic precautions, making new work, and — perhaps above all — finding new grounds for solidarity with one another and with other affected communities to figure out how to respond to the current climate. Recent anti-Asian sentiment might have been stoked by Donald Trump’s xenophobic response to Covid-19, which he often called “the Chinese virus.” But it existed long before before him, since the arrival of Chinese workers workers in the 19 th century, and stubbornly persists, persists, even after his departure from office. The affects of this rhetoric have laid bare the vulnerabilities of a group that comprises 5 percent of the US. population, and is breathtakingly diverse in its makeup, marked by extreme disparities in income, language and culture. The murders in Atlanta, where a young white man killed workers and others in Asian-owned massage businesses, highlighted highlighted more complexities of gender and race: of the eight victims, six were AsianAmerican AsianAmerican women, mostly of Korean descent. An exhibition titled “Godzilla vs. the Art World: 1990-2001,” which was to open in May at the Museum of Chinese in America, and a forthcoming anthology edited by the curator Howie Chen about the group, Godzilla, a loose affiliation of artists and curators, curators, are reminders that activism is not new for Asian-American art workers. They have been organizing for years to increase representation, improve their visibility and forge alliances with other groups. Godzilla was founded in 1990 in New York City by Ken Chu, Bing Lee, Margo Machida, and others. The group tackled problems associated associated with being Asian-American in an art world that tended to see race only in terms of Black and white. In the wake of the 1991 Whitney Biennial, it wrote to the museum’s museum’s director to object to the near-absence of Asian-American artists. The message had its intended effect: The 1993 biennial included work by several artists artists of Asian descent, including Byron Kim. His “Synecdoche,” a minimalist grid of painted panels, each keyed to the precise skin tone of a friend, a neighbor, or stranger, functioned as an abstract group portrait of his multicultural world. A recent series of abstract works by Kim signals an important shift: It still focuses on skin — but this time that skin is bruised. Done around the time of the 2016 presidential presidential election, the pigment-dyed canvases are less a celebration of multiculturalism than a subtle commentary on the rise of xenophobic xenophobic and racist politics in the United States. Likewise, today’s wave of activism seems less concerned about representation — inclusion inclusion of artists in exhibitions or hiring of more Asian-American museum staff — than about larger issues that put their communities communities at risk — like the surveillance of immigrant immigrant neighborhoods, income inequality and criminalization of sex work. This change in approach recently led 19 artists involved in Godzilla to withdraw from the exhibition planned by the Museum of Chinese in America in protest of what they called the museum’s “complicit support” of the construction of a jail in Chinatown. (The museum received a $35 million concession from the city, part of a program to invest funds in neighborhoods affected by the construction construction of facilities following Rikers Island’s Island’s planned closure.) The museum disputes this characterization. characterization. Nancy Yao Maasbach, its president, said, “MOCA has always unalterably and vocally vocally been against a Chinatown jail,” adding that its position is that cultural funding for marginalized groups is “critical to redefining the American narrative.” The artist Betty Yu, a founder of Chinatown Chinatown Art Brigade (CAB), said, “The way to fight this kind of xenophobia and white supremacy supremacy is to organize and fight the root causes of structural racism and capitalism.” With her co-founders Tomie Arai and ManSee Kong, and a network of other artists and organizers, CAB has been working over the past five years to oppose the gentrification gentrification of New York’s Chinatown neighborhood and the resulting mass displacement. The loss of affordable housing and the closing of garment factories employing thousands thousands of new immigrants are also connected to the art world. More art galleries are moving moving into the area, driving up rents. That encroachment has driven other activist activist groups to focus on the art world as an epicenter for talking about anti-Asian hate. Stop DiscriminAsian (S.D.A.), which came into being a year ago when Yi began to connect connect disparate Asian-centered groups and individuals working around the country, including including Kim and Tam. As the group grew, the question of how to leverage their own positions positions in the art world became central. “It was one of the compelling things that we thought that we as arts workers could contribute to, just because of the fact that so many art spaces, at least in New York and L.A. and even the Bay Area, were physically adjacent to Asian communities,” Tam said. Because of shutdowns, S.DA’.s work has largely been visible on social media — Instagram Instagram above all. The organization has created created multilingual graphics and downloadable posters, generated memes, commissioned short videos by artists, co-sponsored a Zoom webinar series titled “Racism is a Public Health Issue,” and disseminated information about resources for Asian-Americans facing discrimination and guidance for their allies. After the uprisings incited by George Floyd’s murder at the hands of the police last May, S.D.A. called on its followers to act in solidarity with Black protesters. Its recent open letter against xenophobia and racial violence calls for the decriminalization decriminalization of sex work and for alternatives to over-policing. It also asks signatories to understand understand the way Asian-Americans have enabled enabled or participated (sometimes unwittingly) unwittingly) in white supremacy, and work to dismantle dismantle it.More than 1,000 artists, curators and art workers have made the pledge. A key strategy for today’s artist-activists is creating visibility: calling attention to the ASIAN. PAUL CHAN AND PRINTED MATTER ‘Our community couldn’t take being invisible any longer.’ AMANDA PHINGBODHIPAKKIYA ARTIST Clockwise from top: A poster at a New York bus stop is part of the public art series “I Still Believe in Our City” by Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya; “The Curio Shop,” an exhibition by the Asian-American artists collective Godzilla, exposed stereotypes about the Asian community in 1993; a still from the Chinatown Art Brigade’s “Here to Stay” projection series; a still from Astria Suparak’s “Virtually Asian,” whose theme is countering invisibility; and Paul Chan’s poster, part of his series parodying signs filled with hate speech from the Westboro Baptist Church. ARTISTS SPACE ASTRIA SUPARAK AND BERKELEY ART CENTER LOUIS CHAN often unseen and unnoted presence of AsianAmerican AsianAmerican communities in cities and in the culture — to their labor and contributions, and to the violence aimed at them. Countering invisibility is at the heart of a short film by Astria Suparak titled “Virtually Asian.” It splices together scenes from science science fiction movies in which urban landscapes landscapes are filled with stereotypical “Asian” signifiers, but the actual characters are almost almost exclusively white. She worked on it during the coronavirus lockdown. “The piece is part of a larger project examining examining 40 years of sci-fi films,” Suparak said, “and how white filmmakers envision a future that is inflected by Asian culture but devoid of actual Asian people.” It emerged, Suparak said, “out of an ongoing erasure and racism and violence, and how both in real life and in mainstream media our varied and unique cultures are carelessly misidentified and jumbled together.” The newly appointed public artist in residence, residence, Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya, began to work with the New York City Commission on Human Rights last August. She quickly started devising a public art project that she would take to the subways to address the way Asian diasporic communities in the city go largely unnoticed. “The commissioner and I went for a walk in Prospect Park,” Phingbodhipakkiya recalled. recalled. “I’m not sure she was looking to brainstorm that morning, but I hit the ground running. I felt like there was no time to waste, and our community couldn’t take being invisible any longer. It was something I approached with extreme urgency.” The result of the collaboration is a public art series, “I Still Believe in Our City,” installed installed on bus shelters, subway stations and, in a spectacular fashion, on the side of the Barclays Center. The choice of transportation transportation hubs was deliberate, the artist said, since so many bias attacks have occurred there. Phingbodhipakkiya has also made them freely downloadable on her website. Featuring a range of Asian-Americans with captions like “I did not make you sick,” “We belong here,” and “I Am Not Your Scapegoat,” they were recently featured on the cover of Time and have been showing up frequently on protest signs at rallies since the Atlanta shootings. Events over the past year have inspired some artists to begin to address themes of Asian-American identities in their work. Over the past year, Tam, who has long explored explored questions of masculinity in his video, sculpture and photography, has turned toward toward questions of Asian-ness. His solo exhibition exhibition “Silent Spikes” — a reference to the immigrant Chinese laborers who built the transcontinental American railroads — is at the Queens Museum until June 23. In it, Tam connects stereotypes about the Asian male body with the image of the cowboy and its role in Westward expansion. Paul Chan is an artist newly spurred to action. action. His work, while often overtly political, has never addressed Asian issues head on — until now. (Chan’s now-defunct publishing imprint, Badlands Unlimited, issued my book on art, race and protest in 2018.) As soon as he heard about the mass shootings in Atlanta, he produced a poster that reads “Anti-Asian=Anti-Murican.” The piece is part of his ongoing “New Proverbs” series, which parodies signs used by the Westboro Baptist Church that he characterizes as “arguably “arguably one of the pioneering Christian hate speech groups in America.” “The murders were the boiling point for me,” Chan said. I couldn’t let the moment go by without manifesting my feelings into form.” As artists begin standing up to anti-Asian hate, there remains the question of how useful useful the term “Asian-American” is, given the range of experiences it’s meant to describe. “Anicka Yi has said this very clearly: ‘What does it mean to be Asian-American in the 21st century?”’ said Margaret Liu Clinton, a curator and member of S.D.A., who talks about the desire to develop pan-Asian conversations conversations among the widest possible swath of art workers. “What continues to unfold is a shared awareness of how different our experiences are across gender, class, generation, immigration, immigration, and I think that’s actually what is exciting exciting about this work right now.”",4/19/2021,"('oppose', 'the', 'gentrification')","('new', 'york', 's')","['” With her co-founders Tomie Arai and ManSee Kong, and a network of other artists and organizers, CAB has been working over the past five years to oppose the gentrification gentrification of New York’s Chinatown neighborhood and the resulting mass displacement.']", With her cofounders Tomie Arai and ManSee Kong and a network of other artists and organizers CAB has been working over the past five years to oppose the gentrification gentrification of New Yorks Chinatown neighborhood and the resulting mass displacement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
382,2544364178,"“OnlyFans has completely shattered shattered any money I was making before the pandemic,” Kane said when we spoke in April. “I’m earning earning more there than I have on any other platform.” Her complaints about the company are numerous: the site’s glitchiness, the hostility implicit in the way it minimizes adult creators’ contributions, the lack of a basic search function. But she emphasized that she “cannot complain about the money.” “OnlyFans is buying houses for girls,” she told me. “It is supporting sex workers’ families. It’s everything that people are saying.” But like the misleading caption used to sell a celebrity’s locked posts, what people people say can be accurate while failing to tell the truth. efore the pandemic, Gia was an independent escort who worked three or four days a week instead of six or seven. She saw clients at her work space in San Francisco, a 480-square-foot studio apartment decorated in tones of blush and dark blue. She called it the Portal, for its ability to make visitors feel transported transported “from Anytown, Metropolitan Metropolitan U.S.A.” to a “wonderland.” Most days, her prework ritual consisted of waking up at 4:30 a.m. so she had a chance of being on the road by 5, driving through the dark in her glasses and pajamas. Once in the apartment, she listened to Minnie Riperton and Funkadelic, prepped for her first appointment and posted posted ads. She took her job seriously because it was the best she’d ever had. “I’ve done so much [expletive] wage labor,” she told me, “taking home small paychecks for long hours. When I first had the opportunity opportunity to do this, I thought: I have all this free time, and I’m making what to do what 1 . I feel like I’m a natural. I love entertaining.” Business was good enough that in February 2020, she renewed the lease for two years. The space cost $4,000 a month, and she recalls management allowing up to five residents residents to sign on, “probably because that’s how many people it usually takes to afford it,” she said ruefully. (Gia shared the space with a friend, but she was the primary leaseholder.) leaseholder.) A month later, on March 9, she saw the man who would be her final in-person client. She turned down subsequent inquiries, saying she intended to social-distance for two weeks. Seventy-two hours later, that time frame seemed less plausible. On March 12, the stock market plunged to a historic low, and local rumors spread about an impending shelter-in-place order. At home, Gia put on Parliament’s “Wizard of Finance” and filmed herself dancing in a dress, then posted the video on Twitter and told people to check out her OnlyFans. She recalls feeling a little dissociated, almost in a dream state, thinking, Here we go. She gave herself one day to sit with her panic and depression. Then, she decided, “I have to log on and figure this out.” From an economic standpoint, in-person sex workers were among those hit earliest and hardest by the pandemic. Weeks before official official state shutdowns, with business trips called off and flight schedules disrupted, clients canceled bookings bookings with escort, kink and massage providers, while strip-club attendance attendance fell. Street-based workers lowered their prices and accepted men they would turn away in better times, as the housing they sometimes sometimes obtained in connection with work — the hotel room paid for by a date or the home offered overnight — became vanishingly rare. Organizations Organizations run by sex workers set up Covid-specific GoFundMe pages as early as March 11, and by midMarch, midMarch, there were funding drives specific to Seattle; New York; Portland, Portland, Ore.; Austin, Texas; Washington, Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas; and Detroit. OnlyFans was a more visible safety net than the mutual-aid collections and offered hope of longer-term support. Thanks to prepandemic news coverage about creators making five to six figures, OnlyFans purported to offer a generous generous income to anyone enterprising enough to try it. Site veterans found their expertise in high demand among friends and acquaintances, many of whom were newly unemployed unemployed escorts or dominatrices, and a few of whom had never sold sex in any form. Compared with clip sales (adult-themed videos shot, edited and ready to upload) and camming (fielding sexual requests in real time), OnlyFans demands little commitment commitment up front. If you’re new to sex work, or have resolved to keep most of your clothes on, you can warm up by posting the sort of tantalizing tantalizing selfies many of us share free on social media, like bikini pics and 60-second, barely clad workouts. Millions of people, meanwhile, particularly single people, found themselves isolated, lonely and horny, bereft of opportunities to meet hookup partners and hang out with friends. They flooded the site with the disposable cash saved by not eating out and going to bars. (Kane told me that a lot of fans spend their stimulus money there.) OnlyFans OnlyFans claims to have transferred over $3 billion of income to its creators since the site’s inception, and while it doesn’t break that disbursement down by year or creator type — the site doesn’t even maintain content categories — it seems likely that a significant part went to sex workers in the past year. Ashley, an organizer with SWOP (Sex Workers Outreach Project) Behind Bars, a social-justice network network that centers on incarcerated sex workers, frames this phenomenon phenomenon as an exciting redistribution of wealth. “I know 10 or 15 trans people people making over $10,000 a month on OnlyFans,” she told me. “And I’ve never known more than one trans person making that much a month in full-service or porn or anything. It’s taking folks from barely homed to having a savings account.” Heather Heather Berg, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and author of “Porn Work,” agreed. “Direct-toconsumer “Direct-toconsumer sites like OnlyFans have been a boon to workers in significant significant ways,” she said, which include increased autonomy and creative free rein as well as more income. “One of the best measures of that is that traditional porn managers are really pissed off about them.” These achievements are a result of creators’ savvy maneuvering and a convergence of circumstances: a global plague, a consumer base accustomed to making spontaneous spontaneous micropayments (think a $5 donation on a friend’s GoFundMe page or $2.99 episodes of streaming streaming TV shows) and, perhaps most important, a denuded marketplace. OnlyFans was perfectly positioned to become a housebound population’s population’s go-to source for explicit material because of what is called the gentrification of the internet. In the context of sex work, this refers to an aggressive pattern of policing both the sex trade and the people who work in it. In the United States, this regulatory regulatory campaign can be traced back to the federal government’s protracted protracted and ultimately successful crusade against Craigslist’s Erotic Services in the early 2010s. Since then, the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors prosecutors have systematically targeted targeted a slew of sites that cater to sex workers, particularly advertising platforms like Backpage, which shuttered in 2018 after a multiyear effort by California’s attorney general general at the time, Kamala Harris. In April that year, the bills known collectively as FOSTA-SESTA, which further criminalize communication communication around commercial sex, were signed into law by Donald Trump. Prevention of sex trafficking trafficking and protection of minors are the most frequent justifications for these laws and prosecutions, but activists reject the claim that these measures help anyone, minors and trafficking victims included. (There is evidence to support their arguments. arguments. In 2019, for instance, a study conducted by researchers at Baylor and Claremont Graduate Universities Universities found that Craigslist’s affordable affordable ads let workers move indoors and screen clients more effectively, which helped reduce female-victim homicides by 10 to 17 percent.)

875,2555860573,"Their Fight Is On Over Commodification CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 Avenger name and our bomb logo have always always existed and been made available as open-source name/graphics to be used in good faith only by and for Lesbian Avengers activities, actions and projects — not to be sold or used to raise funds by a commercial venture.” By then, the shirt had disappeared from the Gap’s site. But its back story turned out to be more complicated than a case of coldblooded coldblooded corporate appropriation. The designer of the logo, Carrie Moyer, a Lesbian Avenger herself, had sold it to the Gap. “To be honest, at first, I didn’t even think they were going to want to use it, because it’s more provocative than how they’re attempting attempting to depict gay people,” Ms. Moyer said of the Gap and the bomb logo. “It’s kind of like a teaser for a history that very little is known about.” As Ms. Moyer told the website Autostraddle, Autostraddle, “the idea of having this sort of mass dispersal dispersal of T-shirts, was like, wow, this is a way to get information out that seems really expedient.” This did nothing to sway the perspective of other Avengers, who view any corporate branding of the group’s history and ideas as antithetical to its mission. “What’s visibility without substance?” Ms. Schulman said. Building a ‘Presence Around Lesbianism’ The Lesbian Avengers were founded in 1992, a year that Ana Maria Simo, a playwright playwright and activist, remembers as an angry one. George H. W. Bush was running for reelection reelection in part on his foreign policy successes, successes, especially the conclusion of the Persian Gulf war, in which 148 Americans died. But AIDS had claimed over 140,000 lives in the United States alone. The federal government government was still responding with indifference indifference both to the virus that decimated a generation generation of gay men and to the activism that it had ignited. More urgently, Ms. Simo was incensed by the gentrification of the East Village, which had been something of a safe haven for lesbians, lesbians, and by a vicious fight over whether New York City public schools should adopt an elementary-school curriculum, known as “Children of the Rainbow,” that affirmed the existence of gay people and other minorities. She invited a group of women to dinner at her home, all of whom had experience as activists: activists: Ms. Schulman, Maxine Wolfe, AnneChristine AnneChristine d’Adesky, Marie Honan and Anne Maguire. Over wine and cheese, they planned to start a group that would fight for lesbian visibility. “It was called the Avengers because Diana Rigg was a lesbian icon on the TV show ‘The Avengers,”’ Ms. Schulman said. The group’s mission was to increase awareness of lesbians — and promote their rights — both within queer culture (radical lesbian politics were mostly associated with second-wave feminists living in insular communities) and the mainstream. “Lesbians are invisible, and we don’t want to be invisible,” Ms. Simo said recently over Zoom. “We want to make our existence known to the world. We want the streets to belong to us. We want to be out there.” That June, at the Gay Pride March in New York City, members handed out “club cards,” colorful pamphlets that read “Lesbians! “Lesbians! Dykes! Gay Women!” and “We want revenge and we want it now!” Printed at the bottom of the handouts was a little icon of a bomb, Ms. Simo’s spur-ofthe-moment spur-ofthe-moment addition, which was a nod to her “little obsession” with revolutionary movements. It “was kind of a 19th-century anarchist type of thing,” she said. The leaflet landed in the hands of Ms. Moyer, a graphic designer who was immediately immediately taken by the group’s romanticized revolutionary stylings. She joined the Lesbian Lesbian Avengers shortly afterward, putting her skills to use making print materials and eventually designing the group’s official logo: a lit bomb, ringed by the words “The Lesbian Avengers” in a bold sans-serif typeface called Frutiger. “Separatist lesbian culture was kind of willfully low-tech,” Ms. Moyer said. “EveryFrom “EveryFrom top: Lesbian Avengers ate fire during the first Dyke March in 1993 in Washington; the original Lesbian Avengers T-shirt featured the words “We Recruit” on the back; and scenes from demonstrations involving supporters of the group. thing was sort of homemade. Having a presence presence around lesbianism that looked like it was part of the sort of sophisticated visual world, part of the world in general, the world that was targeted to everyone, felt really important.” The logo was put to a vote. Not everyone was a fan at first. Ms. d’Adesky said that she worried the imagery read as aggressive. But, she said, “humor was going to be part of our messaging, because there was a stereotype that remained in the culture around: You are angry, humorless lesbians.” lesbians.” She grew to embrace the bomb. Like their logo, the Lesbian Avengers’ activism activism was in-your-face and tongue-incheek. tongue-incheek. (Their manifesto calling on “all lesbians” lesbians” read, in part, “Closeted lesbians, queer boys and sympathetic straights should give us money”) At their first action, outside an elementary school in Queens where the school board had rejected the Children of It was 'bizarre’ to see the logo on a retailers website. the Rainbow curriculum, the Avengers arrived arrived with a marching band, handing out purple balloons to children that read, “Ask About Lesbian Lives.” On Valentine’s Day in 1993, they gave out chocolate kisses in Grand Central Terminal with the message “You’ve just been kissed by a lesbian,” and in Bryant Park, they unveiled unveiled a papier-mache figure of the lesbian socialite Alice B. Toklas next to the sculpture sculpture of the writer Gertrude Stein, Toklas’s more famous lover. At the New York City memorial for a lesbian lesbian and a gay man who had burned to death in Salem, Ore., after a Molotov cocktail cocktail was tossed into their apartment, members members of the Lesbian Avengers ate fire and chanted: “The fire will not consume us. We take it and make it our own.” (Fire-eating eventually became one of the group’s hallmarks.) hallmarks.) Chapters cropped up in dozens of cities across the country and even abroad, many using the bomb logo, which the New York group made available for reproduction. reproduction. The Lesbian Avengers’ longest-lasting legacy is the annual Dyke March, which was first held on April 24,1993, on the eve of the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation, one of the largest protests against L.G.B.T.Q. discrimination discrimination ever held in the United States. In response to what the Avengers saw as a male-dominated events calendar — and in the spirit of civil disobedience — the group called on women to take to the streets of the capital without a permit the day before. “We didn’t even realize how brilliant we were by doing it in D.C., where people had come from all over the world,” Ms. Schulman said. “The women went home to their towns and their cities and they did the same. The next year these marches were everywhere, without any coordination, and some of them still exist.” The Dyke March will convene for the 29th time this weekend in cities including New York and San Francisco — in many places, still without a permit. A Case of Amplification? In late 2019, Ms. Moyer, the logo’s designer, was connected to the Gap through Avram Finkelstein, a friend, former ACT UP member member and co-founder of the collective that made the famous “Silence=Death” antiAIDS antiAIDS graphic, who was collaborating with the retailer on a line of graphic T-shirts. PHOTOGRAPHS BY CAROLINA KROON The Gap T-shirt was modeled on an original original Lesbian Avengers T-shirt from the 1990s. But where the original shirt featured the words “We Recruit” on the back (a satirical satirical sendup of right-wing fears that gay people were “recruiting” children into their lifestyle), the Gap version sported a paragraph paragraph on the history of the Avengers, including including the names of the six founders. Ms. Simo said she found out by stumbling across a screenshot of the Gap’s website: “It was a really bizarre thing to see.” Like other Lesbian Avengers members who spoke with The New York Times, Ms. Simo said she was not contacted by either Ms. Moyer or the Gap in advance, but found out about the shirt through social media. “Somebody tweeted at me the page from the Gap,” Ms. Schulman said. “I said, ‘Oh, they stole it from us.’ ” In an interview, Ms. Moyer said she did not contact all of the Lesbian Avengers founders before licensing the image but did confer closely with one of them: Maxine Wolfe. “The thing that won out was that the historical historical information would be on the back and would get to people who otherwise would not get it,” Ms. Wolfe said. And it wasn’t wasn’t information like, ‘Smile, it’s Pride,’ but information information about a direct-action group. More people have been speaking about the Lesbian Lesbian Avengers than have in a long, long time.” Ms. Moyer received $7,000 from the Gap for the use of the logo on the shirt, all of which, she said, she donated to the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Park Slope, Brooklyn. “I saw the whole interaction as a way to support” the archives, Ms. Moyer said, “this place that has basically preserved our history history since the beginning.” But she also said she had never signed off on a finalized design that would list the names of the founders on the back of the shirt. She said she was surprised both by the shirt’s release this spring, which she learned about on Facebook, and by the text on its back, which she had not approved. When she spoke to the Gap, the person who had initially been in charge of the project had left the company. “I found out that the copy on the back of the T-shirts (listing the names of the founders) was never replaced with the correct text,” Ms. Moyer wrote in an email to The Times. “This violates the contract I signed.” About 1,100 shirts were produced, and they were sold only online, a representative for the Gap said. The company also said that it had a long history of supporting the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Ms. Moyer stands by her initial decision to license the Lesbian Avengers logo: “I designed designed the logo, and that logo is out in the world and in a bazillion places,” she said. She pointed out that several websites without without any affiliation to the Lesbian Avengers (or their permission) sold merchandise featuring featuring the design. But for Ms. Schulman, Ms. Simo and Ms. d’Adesky, the commercialization of the logo by the Gap in particular was irreconcilable with the anti-corporate ethics of the group. “The nature of the beast is that it needs to be fed,” Ms. Simo said. “Now everybody is the hero of the day when they can become commodities commodities that can be sold.” This specific disagreement speaks to a much bigger question when it comes to progress for the L.G.B.T.Q. community. While there may be Pride flags in storefronts storefronts and more queer characters on television, television, the number of hate crimes against L.G.B.T.Q. people reported by the F.B.I. hasn’t changed much over two decades, there are legislative assaults on trans rights nationwide and functionally no lesbian spaces are left in the country. Pride provides a moment of collective catharsis. catharsis. Corporations play to that legacy while also cashing in on images of acceptance acceptance and inclusion that may be more palatable palatable to the majority culture. The Lesbian Avengers T-shirt sold by the Gap bypassed love-is-love platitudes to sell a memory of a community’s radical roots — for $34.95. In its contradictions, the shortlived shortlived shirt has become a fraught collector’s item of this moment in L.G.B.T.Q. history: a limited edition item that is as unlikely to beat people into consumerist apathy as it is to shock them into revolutionary fervor.",6/27/2021,"('incensed', 'by', 'the')","('the', 'east', 'village')","[' Simo was incensed by the gentrification of the East Village, which had been something of a safe haven for lesbians, lesbians, and by a vicious fight over whether New York City public schools should adopt an elementary-school curriculum, known as “Children of the Rainbow,” that affirmed the existence of gay people and other minorities.']", Simo was incensed by the gentrification of the East Village which had been something of a safe haven for lesbians lesbians and by a vicious fight over whether New York City public schools should adopt an elementaryschool curriculum known as Children of the Rainbow that affirmed the existence of gay people and other minorities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2261,2577462228,"WHAT GENTRIFICATION MEANS FOR BLACK HOMEOWNERS Owners selling their houses on the open market have to grapple with the fact that accepting the highest bid could mean yet another step toward Black displacement. By JACQUELYNN KERUBO nostalgia isn’t enough to keep Thomas Holley, Holley, 74, in the Crown Heights brownstone he has lived in for more than 58 years. He got married in that home and raised his children there. His basement man cave, complete complete with a bar and mood lighting, was an oasis where he escaped for alone time. But now fully retired from his transit job as a bus operator and having suffered health setbacks setbacks — a heart attack and spinal surgery — he wants to trade in the brownstone for more quiet and all-year sunshine at the condo he purchased purchased in 2017 in a suburb north of Orlando, Fla. He loves Brooklyn, but the gentrification of Crown Heights has been hard for him to watch and experience. As a Black homeowner, he would like, more than anything else, to see another another Black homeowner take over the house. But it’s precisely because gentrification has driven property values up that Mr. Holley may not be able to do that. Like other Black homeowners selling family homes in competitive ZIP codes, Mr. Holley feels as if the sale is freighted with the burden of his race. He had hoped to leave the house to his only living child, a son in New Jersey, but his son isn’t interested in the brownstone. Mr. Holley fears that when he lists the house on the open market, he may unintentionally play a part in the continued displacement of the Black community community in Crown Heights. “I can’t turn down a market offer, because it’s for my six grandkids,” he said. “I want to leave something behind for them.” The history of racial exclusion, segregation and inequality in real estate has made homeownership homeownership for Blacks signify much more than basic shelter and financial stability. “There are absolutely unique ways that the Black homeownership homeownership experience is different from other experiences,” said Jacob William Faber, a professor professor of sociology and public service at New York University. “Black people and Black communities have been excluded from the opportunity to build wealth, and that’s why passing their homes along to a family feels so important,” he added. “There’s so much history that it’s not just a financial financial transaction. It’s a cultural transaction. And it’s a familial transaction.” Mr. Holley estimates that the 12-room, twofamily twofamily house he inherited from his mother may be worth close to $2 million, well beyond what most of his friends or family members could afford. afford. He offered to sell it to a friend at a belowmarket belowmarket price, but his friend could not qualify for a mortgage. He knows when he lists the house, he will have to abide by fair housing rules and not discriminate based on race. Mr. Holley remembers when Crown Heights felt as if it were “100 percent Black.” The area is now less than 50 percent Black. “That doesn’t bother me,” Mr. Holley said. “It’s some of the people moving in that are problematic.” Not too long ago, he said, “I noticed a neighbor neighbor putting up something out front, and I was curious. I went over to strike conversation, and before I could finish a sentence, he told me that he didn’t have any money.” Being mistaken for a panhandler by one of his new white neighbors sent a clear message about how the neighborhood neighborhood was evolving. “I’ve lived here all my life,” he said. “Only three other people on the block who’ve been here longer than I have.” Mr. Holley has made peace with the fact that his home most likely won’t sell to a Black person, person, but he feels sad and a little guilty: “Once Black people move out, it’s hard for them to get back into the neighborhood because the gentrification gentrification completely prices them out.” To allay the sense of guilt Black homeowners might feel when selling their home in a gentrifying gentrifying community, Dr. Faber noted first and foremost foremost that “these longtime homeowners should be congratulated and appropriately compensated compensated for these investments they made in these neighborhoods when white households were fleeing decades ago.” He added that the problems associated with gentrification, “such as rising costs of living, increased increased police harassment, political and social displacement, aren’t caused by Black homeowners.” homeowners.” They are caused, he said, “by forces that move property, like speculative real estate purchasing, the consolidation of rental properties, properties, zoning laws, mortgage markets. All of these things are far more influential than the individual individual homeowner.” Despite a long history of Black homeownership homeownership in New York City, ever-rising real estate prices have made homes in the city inaccessible ‘I NOTICED A NEIGHBOR PUTTING UP SOMETHING OUT FRONT, AND I WAS CURIOUS. I WENT OVER TO STRIKE CONVERSATION, AND BEFORE I COULD FINISH A SENTENCE, HE TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN’T HAVE ANY MONEY.’ THOMAS HOLLEY, CROWN HEIGHTS, BROOKLYN to many Black New Yorkers. According to a report report on homeownership by the New York University University Furman Center, New York City’s homeownership homeownership rate in 2014 was just 31 percent, less than half that of the national homeownership rate, 63 percent. Only 26 percent of Black households households in the city owned their homes, compared with 42 percent for white households, 39 percent percent for Asian households, and 15 percent for Hispanic households. Jeremie Greer, the co-founder and co-executive co-executive director of Liberation in a Generation, a nonprofit focused on racial justice, believes that fair housing rules could be used to benefit Black homeowners and buyers. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Act, which requires localities localities to identify and address patterns of racial segregation outlawed under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, “was degraded during the Trump administration but has recently been restored, and can be used to buttress some of the challenges challenges that Black and brown home buyers are facing,” he said. For example, the act could be used to require communities to examine the legacy legacy of redlining, he said, and “force local jurisdictions jurisdictions to provide remedies like down payment assistance and low-interest loans to Black and brown home buyers.” When it comes to selling her three-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Evelyn Polhill, 89, strikes a pragmatic tone. “America is a capitalistic country; it’s all about what the market can bear,” she said. “If you’re selling",8/22/2021,"('brooklyn', 'but', 'the')","('crown', 'heights', 'has')","[' He loves Brooklyn, but the gentrification of Crown Heights has been hard for him to watch and experience.']", He loves Brooklyn but the gentrification of Crown Heights has been hard for him to watch and experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3867,2576928695,"Bob Diamond, 61, Brooklyn ( Tunnel King 9 Who Fought for Trolleys, Dies By CLAY RISEN Bob Diamond, an engineeringschool engineeringschool dropout who discovered a long-forgotten rail tunnel beneath Downtown Brooklyn and later spent more than 20 years trying to revive the borough’s trolley system, system, only to be stymied by bureaucratic bureaucratic wrangling and his own eccentricities, eccentricities, died on Aug. 21 at his home in the borough’s Kensington section. He was 61. His girlfriend and only immediate immediate survivor, Sharon Rozsay, said the cause was a stroke followed by a brief illness. Mr. Diamond had just withdrawn withdrawn from the electrical engineering engineering program at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1979 when he overheard overheard a radio interview with an author who claimed that John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Abraham Lincoln, had not been captured and killed but had in fact escaped and managed to stash his diary in a secret rail tunnel in Brooklyn. The outlandish story caught Mr. Diamond’s imagination, and, lacking lacking any clear career path, he dove into the hunt for the hidden railway. railway. Evidence of a tunnel emerged immediately as he pored through old newspaper microfilms at the New York Public Library, and later as he perused topographical maps at Brooklyn Borough Hall. But where exactly was it? After more than a year of searching, Mr. Diamond finally pinpointed one possible entrance, at the intersection of Atlantic Avenue Avenue and Court Street. He received permission to enter, and one day in 1981 he and several city officials popped open a manhole manhole cover across from a bank that is now a Trader Joe’s. Mr. Diamond dropped in — but the hole was only three feet deep. There was, however, however, a narrow space headed west, toward toward the East River. With an oxygen oxygen tank in tow, he belly-crawled about 70 feet until he found the top of a brick arch. He cleared away enough dirt to open a hole beneath the arch, then dropped a rope ladder over the edge and climbed down. His flashlight flashlight beam disappeared into the darkness — the brick-arched tunnel tunnel was about 1,600 feet long, 17 feet high and 21 feet wide. “My first time inside the tunnel was akin to landing on the moon,” he said in a 2009 interview with the Pratt Institute magazine Pratt Folio. “I think I have a sense of how Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Aldrin must have felt setting foot on its surface.” 1959-2009 Randy Snow A Paralympic champion of wheelchair tennis, he was the first Paralympic athlete inducted into the Olympic Hall of Fame. By CINDY SHMERLER Randy Snow was 16 when the accident happened. happened. It was July 1975, and he was toiling away at his summer job on a farm in Paris, Texas, when a 1,000-pound bale of hay that he was loading onto a tractor fell from its prongs, crushing him in the tractor’s steering compartment. The impact severed severed his spine, and despite months of rehab, he would never walk again. But it did not stop him from becoming a world champion athlete. He became the first Paralympian Paralympian in history to win medals in three different sports — track, basketball and, most notably, tennis. By the time he retired from competitive wheelchair wheelchair sports in 2000, Snow had won 10 U.S. Open tennis singles titles and six in doubles play. In the 1990-91 season alone, he won 68 consecutive matches and 15 straight tournaments, becoming the first International Tennis Federation Wheelchair Wheelchair World Champion. He earned gold medals in singles and doubles at the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona, and in 2004 he became the first Paralympic Paralympic athlete inducted into the Olympic Hall of Fame. In 2012, he was inducted posthumously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. He had died of a heart attack on Nov. 19,2009, in El Salvador, where he had been giving a tennis clinic. He was 50. Snow became a leader in developing wheelchair tennis, which had only a handful of tournaments when he began playing. It is now played in more than 100 countries and at all four major championships championships — Wimbledon and the Australian, French and U.S. Opens. “Dreams make everyday life tolerable,” Snow, who became an author and motivational speaker, wrote in an essay in 2000. “Without dreams, life would be mediocre. Initially my spinal cord injury dashed any hope of achieving those dreams. But sometimes re-dreaming is necessary. As I reflect on the 25 years after that hot July day, I now know that my childhood dreams were realized. Not only did I win the U.S. Open, I won it 10 times. I just happened to win it in a wheelchair.” Thomas Randall Snow was born on May 24, 1959, in Austin, Texas, the oldest of four children of Alison Lee McElhone, a kindergarten teacher, and Thomas Snow, a real estate attorney who had played baseball at the University of Texas. The family later moved to Terrell, east of Dallas. Randy was an ardent athlete, excelling in football, football, baseball, basketball and tennis. Though his parents divorced when he was 12, they lived less than a mile apart and each built a backyard tennis court to encourage family participation in the sport. “It seemed like he always had a ball in his hand,” his father said in a phone interview. “Studies “Studies were not his thing. He was most interested in sports.” Randy was on the football team at Terrell High School when he suffered the spinal injury. After spending months in a Dallas hospital and then at a rehabilitation facility in Denver, he was on his way home when he asked his family if he could stop by * ANDREA MOHIN/THE NEW YORK TIMES Bob Diamond in 1997 with two of his beloved trolley cars. He spent more than 20 years trying to bring trolleys back to Brooklyn. The tunnel, he established, had been built by the Long Island Rail Road Company in 1844 and apparently apparently ran to the waterfront, but it was closed in 1861 because of the company’s financial difficulties. Almost immediately, it had become become a part of Brooklyn lore: One article from The New York Times in 1893 claimed it had been used by river pirates to secrete their illgotten illgotten wares. With the city’s permission, Mr. Diamond started giving paid tours of the tunnel, one of the many ways during his life that he made ends meet. He occasionally worked with local theater troupes and art galleries to stage shows and performances inside it. Discovering the tunnel was more than a lark. Since he was a child, Mr. Diamond had dreamed of bringing back Brooklyn’s trolley system, which had once covered 300 miles of the borough’s streets but had been discontinued in 1956. He envisioned the tunnel as a new terminus. In 1982 he founded the Brooklyn BOB DAEMMR1CH/ALAMY the school, where a pep rally for his former team was taking place. As the students and staff members members rose in ovation, Snow spun his wheelchair and bellowed, “I’m baaaack!” The crowd roared its approval. “That was Randy,” his sister Jenny Sperry said in a phone interview. “I’m still here, I’m still showy, and I still have my spunk.” After graduating from high school in 1977, Snow Historic Railway Association. By the early 1990s the group had acquired acquired several vintage streetcars and free rent on a warehouse in Red Hook, a waterfront section of the borough that at the time was run-down. The mid-1990s found the city swooning over a streetcar revival — plans were in place for a line crossing Midtown Manhattan — and Mr. Diamond quickly secured over $300,000 in federal and local grants. Working with volunteers, he soon had about 1,600 feet of track laid along the cobblestones of Red Hook. He even invented a transformer that allowed the trolleys trolleys to draw power from the city’s electrical system without having to use a substation. On May 1,1997, Mr. Diamond piloted piloted a short line of Pullman cars about 600 feet along the waterfront waterfront in Red Hook. By then he was something of a living legend in the borough, known as “the Tunnel King,” and dozens of reporters and onlookers came to watch. “It was a great relief when nothing nothing exploded,” Mr. Diamond told The New York Times. “Then it was an out-of-body experience. I was watching something that no one has seen in Brooklyn since 1956.” But the trolley went no farther. A change in administrations at City Hall, the rapid gentrification of Red Hook and Mr. Diamond’s failure to raise private donations, which the city said were required to keep the grants going, brought the project to a halt. In 2002, the city announced that it was withdrawing support. The next year the developer who had given Mr. Diamond free rent evicted him. In May 2003, city work crews removed several tons of railroad ties and cobblestones that he said he had collected with his own money. Later that year Mr. Diamond was emerging from a tour of the Atlantic Avenue tunnel when he was met by police officers, who handcuffed him and served him with a summons, claiming that he did not have permission to enter.

He also began a lifelong addiction to drugs and alcohol, alcohol, a battle that would take him in and out of rehab for the next 25 years, his father said. Struggling academically at Austin, Snow transferred transferred to UT-Arlington and earned a bachelor’s degree in business there in 1986. He later received a master’s degree in psychology from the University University of Phoenix. In the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Snow won a silver medal during an exhibition wheelchair race that looped four times around the track of the Los Angeles Coliseum before a crowd of about 60,000. His father said, “I was screaming, ‘Hurry up!’ even though I knew he couldn’t hear me.” Snow was in last place, he said, “but then, when Randy was passing everyone on the final lap — just like it was a horse race — the crowd went crazy.” Snow began playing wheelchair tennis around 1980 after attending a clinic led by Brad Parks, a co-founder of the National Foundation of Wheeldence, Wheeldence, that someone in the Brooklyn Brooklyn borough government was out to get him, perhaps in cahoots with a former volunteer who had broken broken off to form his own nonprofit trolley association. The city removed all but a few feet of trolley track in the fall of 2003, but left several of his rail cars. In January 2004 he invited a reporter from The New York Times to take a trip on what remained. remained. He called it “the world’s shortest trolley ride.” Robert Stephen Turin was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 6,1959. His father, father, Max Turin, worked in the garment garment industry, and his mother, Elsa Brill, sold cosmetics. His parents parents divorced when he was young, and his mother, who raised him, changed the family name to Diamond. Diamond. Bob won a scholarship to Pratt after drawing the school’s attention attention with a proposal for a satellite that could beam solar-derived electricity to earth. But the scholarship scholarship required him to work part of the year for Kodak, based in ONLINE: OVERLOOKED Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times. nytimes.com/overlooked chair Tennis and a former world champion in the sport. The two became fierce rivals on the court. “He once told me that he put my picture on his bathroom wall because he wanted to beat me so badly,” Parks said of Snow by phone. “That’s how competitive he was.” They later became partners and secured the gold medal in doubles at the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona. Snow also competed for the United States in the men’s World Team Cup from 1986 to 1995, helping the team win seven championship titles while traveling all over the world in a high performance, lightweight Quickie wheelchair that he had designed designed with his business partner, the wheelchair athlete Marilyn Hamilton. In 1996, Hamilton arranged for him to receive the Olympic torch from President Bill Clinton in Washington to start the relay to the opening ceremony ceremony of the Atlanta Paralympics. As an author Snow wrote “Wheelchair Tennis: Myth to Reality” with Dr. Bal Moore, a college coach and close friend and a mentor for 12 years. Published in 1994, it is widely regarded as the gold standard for teaching the sport of wheelchair tennis. Snow also wrote “Pushing Forward: A Memoir of Motivation” (2001) and “Too Far From Home” (2006), whose cover describes it as “A Book About Change, Teamwork, and Being Safe.” Moore met with Snow regularly for 6 a.m. “visits” “visits” — practice sessions in which Snow developed an effective topspin backhand, a harder serve and more potent volleying, most of which his opponents opponents had not yet mastered. “Randy was really strong, and he had this bigbarreled bigbarreled chest which he used to house the heart of a lion,” said David Kiley, a friend and frequent opponent. In his later years Snow taught beginners at camps he ran worldwide, imploring them, Parks said, to cheer, “Wheelchair tennis: I love it, I love it, I love it!” “I’ve never known anyone who could captivate like Randy,” Paul Walker, a professional wheelchair wheelchair tennis player, wrote in an email. “He was a magician with people young and old.” Three months after his death in El Salvador, his friend and fellow tennis player Bill Hammett returned returned there to spread some of Snow’s ashes in the Pacific Ocean, not far from a public court that was renamed in Snow’s honor. Hammett dipped his toes in the chilly water, then slipped on a stone under the surface. As he fell, he held a fruit jar that contained Snow’s ashes high above his head to protect them. “Everyone who was watching from the beach thought I was crying,” Hammett said by phone. “But I was just laying there laughing. I couldn’t help thinking, ‘Randy, I know you’re laughing your ass off right now.’ ” He unearthed a brick-arched tunnel that was built in 1844. Rochester, N.Y. — practically the Arctic north for a Brooklyn boy — and he left after a year. Mr. Diamond taught for a time at City College, Ms. Rozsay said, but he rarely held a regular job. After After losing access to the Atlantic Avenue tunnel, he and Ms. Rozsay moved to Long Branch, N.J., where she owned an apartment building he helped manage. He began began abusing drugs and alcohol and was diagnosed with post-traumatic post-traumatic stress disorder. He eventually got clean, and he and Ms. Rozsay returned to Brooklyn in 2006. The next year the city offered him renewed access access to the tunnel, and for the next three years he led up to 400 people a month on a tour below Brooklyn’s Brooklyn’s busy streets. He also became obsessed with rumors that a locomotive, used to pull cars along the underground line, was still hidden behind a wall in the tunnel. He and a team from National Geographic looked for it using a metal detector, but before they had definitive evidence the city once again barred him from the tunnel, this time claiming it was a fire hazard. Mr. Diamond filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract, but it fizzled. In the 2010s he consulted on a new proposal for a streetcar line running along the Brooklyn and Queens waterfronts, but that too failed. And he never gave up his obsession with the Atlantic Avenue Avenue tunnel, or his dream of bringing bringing streetcars back to his hometown. hometown. “That was one of the amazing things about Bob,” Brian Kassel, the vice president of the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association, said in an interview. “His persistence, his willingness to go on the quest even when it seemed quixotic.” Mr. Diamond in recent years found a new subterranean object of desire: a short pneumatic-powered pneumatic-powered rail line that had been built in the 1870s beneath City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan.

CONTINUED FROM PAGE Cl comes with my brand of stand-up. I’m somebody you know. I’m your cousin or your uncle, and we’re here to celebrate each other.” “I’m there to do every job that a host is supposed to do,” he continued. “I may go and kick it with people. You may see me do a food-pass tray — have some crudites, my friend. Please, go in my closet, wear one of my jackets, you’re fine.” Cedric spoke further about his plans for the Emmy Awards, the divide that separates separates cable and streaming comedies from network shows like “The Neighborhood” and his precarious return to stand-up for the first time in 18 months. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How were you approached about hosting the Emmys? It was really one of those serendipitous things where it just showed up. I had no idea. I was on a Zoom call for something else, pitching a show or something, and the producers saw me and were like, “Oh, this dude will do a good job.” Afterward, the producers called me, like, “Oh, yeah, by the way, you think you want to host the Emmys?” Emmys?” I’m like: “Uh, hell yeah. Let’s do it.” You didn’t have any hesitation about doing it? My biggest thing was, was it going to be virtual virtual again? A virtual situation doesn’t necessarily necessarily appeal to me as a live performer and a stand-up. I don’t know if that would have been as sexy. But it was planned to be back in a venue with people giving out awards, having a good time. It will still be socially distanced and responsible. I’m the host, and I’m onstage by myself, so I won’t see none of you people. [Laughs.] What kind of sensibility are you hoping to bring to this year’s show? There was a lot of great television on in the past year and, due to the pandemic, many of G L ASKEW II FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES us watched way more television than normal. normal. We want to blend these things together — shows that you heard of but didn’t really watch, mixed with some shows that you know. Though we’re dressed up and wearing wearing tuxedos, I don’t want that Oscars feel — that [haughty laughter] ha, ha, ha, ha. Do you think that kind of elitism has been turning viewers off from awards shows in recent years? I was telling the writers, let’s remove the velvet rope of it all — the feeling that, when you look at these shows, this is for them. Me being on a network sitcom ... streamers and cable are really what the Emmys are about, the more avant-garde things. The smart television. It started to have this feeling feeling like people aren’t really invited in the room. We all do a job here. Some people have more serious dramatic shows that are fun and interesting to watch. And some people people have veg-out, “sit down and relax” television. television. Let’s take the judgment out. That’s what I want to do. Is it hard for viewers to get excited about celebrating famous people in the midst of a pandemic? People have very specific feelings about this and rightfully so. I definitely want the stars to come out and have fun. And there is a desire for that — people just want to experience experience a night out, done as safely as possible. possible. But I also understand that on any given day, and depending on what our governor is feeling here, these things could change. I’m remaining hopeful at this moment — trying to have that spirit of, let’s get back to some normalcy. Would it help to introduce some new award categories? We’ve talked about this. Just the one line in the series that you love so much. The rest of the show was, eh, OK. But the way this person person said that thing? Or when someone cried the hardest. There’s just not enough recog‘I’m recog‘I’m there to do every job that a host is supposed to do. I may go and kick it with people.’ CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER nition for the specifics. You’ve spent the pandemic catching up on series that you missed. Is there another show, besides your own, that you wish you could appear on? Oh man, would I love to be on “The Crown.”: “Archie, I’m your real dad ...” You talk about controversy! Oh my God. [Laughs.] But of course I love “Succession.” Man, it would be great to show up as some cool lawyer lawyer or money mogul. Just being a billionaire and talking about it like it’s an everyday thing — to live it, for a little a bit. I just want to jump on a helicopter and go places. At a time when network sitcoms are in short supply, “The Neighborhood” is about to start its fourth season on Monday. What do you think has kept it on the air this long? I think the idea of people living together and learning how to get along is attractive. We took the conflict around the gentrification of neighborhoods and added a humanity to that. It’s not about us and them. It’s about, how can we get along? We do talk about serious serious issues but without getting preachy; we’re never trying to sway you one way or the other. And we’ll push a little bit, in a CBS kind of way. You feel that the Emmys favor cable and streaming comedies over their network counterparts? I do think that there should be space for all types of television. To me, our show is in the tradition of the TV that we grew up on, where we had four or five channels and a show like ours would have been considered [exaggerated voice] very important at the time. In a world of cable and streamers, with the ability to push language or whatever whatever a writer wants to see, we have a degree of handcuffs. It can appear that you’re softer, softer, that you’re not as edgy. But some people don’t necessarily care for that in their home. I don’t need everything to be edgy, and I don’t need to see everybody with their shirt off. I get it. People have sex, got it. Has the pandemic made day-to-day production production of your show more difficult? To a degree. You don’t have that contact with people that you used to — especially with the writers, where you’re flowing and things happen in the moment. Before the pandemic, the writers would come down to the floor and I could talk to them: “Yo, guys, I want this joke to be stronger,” or, “I feel like that’s kind of typical, let’s go at it a different way.” Now that note is given virtually, and it’s given to one person. That’s difficult. Of course we have to rehearse with shields and masks on until we get ready to do a scene. And testing. There’s so much testing. The amount of cotton swabs that’s been up in my nose — oh, the calluses on the inside. Mike Tyson could hit me in my nose right now, it wouldn’t bleed. You recently started performing some stand-up shows again after a pandemicimposed pandemicimposed hiatus of about 18 months. What was that like? Going onstage and not having my rhythm, the audience had to be very patient with me. I had like two brain freezes — I was up there, totally frozen — and the crowd started yelling out jokes for me to do. I said, “Thank you, guys.” I think they were just happy to be out of the house themselves. They were like: “Don’t leave. Just talk to us. Whatever’s on your mind. It doesn’t even have to be funny. We just don’t want to go home yet.” Did you immediately check TMZ to see if they had posted any clips from these shows? It was scary. I give great praise to anybody that does their job in a real way — it’s the consistency, it’s the hustle, it’s the care. If you stop it and think you can go flip a switch, you’ll be quite surprised. For your supporting role in the film “First Reformed,” you took the rare step of being billed under your given name, Cedric Kyles. How do you decide when to do that or not? The film was very sincere, and we didn’t want anybody coming in, knowing me as Cedric the Entertainer, and having expectations expectations of jokes. I did another film called “Son of the South,” where I played Ralph Abernathy. Abernathy. In this one, they’d rather I used Cedric the Entertainer, because the movie was small and they were trying to get as much of a pop as possible. We went back and forth over how I should be billed in that one, and that became a little bit more of a marketing choice. I always say Cedric Kyles is my kids’ father. I’m not sure how much I’m willing to expose myself that way. We shall see. Is there another historical figure you would want to play if you had the chance? I’ve always wanted to play Marcus Garvey. He’s an interesting character, especially in the 1920s, that had the ability to communicate communicate on multiple continents without internet, internet, without Wi-Fi. How do you that? He was one of these leaders with an entrepreneurial entrepreneurial spirit. I don’t know of anybody else who’s tried to have a shipping company. We don’t have one Black dude that’s tried to build boats? That was it?

Towers Rise Over Londons Brick Lane, Clouding Its Future International By AINA J. KHAN LONDON — Ornate English and Bengali Bengali typography adorns the signs of Taj Stores, one of the oldest Bangladeshi-run supermarkets in the Brick Lane neighborhood neighborhood of East London. The signs evoke a part of the area’s past, when it became known as “Banglatown,” and eventually home to the largest Bangladeshi community community in Britain. But Brick Lane’s future is looking very uncertain, said Jamal Khalique, standing inside a supermarket opened in 1936 by his great-uncle and now run by Mr. Khalique and his two brothers. Modern office buildings of glass and steel and a cluster of apartments and cranes tower above the skyline. New coffee coffee shops, restaurants, food markets and hotels appear in the neighborhood each year. According to one study, the borough borough of Tower Hamlets, which contains Brick Lane, had the most gentrification in London from 2010 to 2016. In September, a borough committee approved plans — under discussion for five years — to build a five-story shopping shopping mall in and around a disused parking parking lot beside a former brewery complex that houses independent shops, galleries, galleries, markets, bars and restaurants. The project would include brand-name chain stores, office spaces and a public square. Like many Brick Lane residents, Mr. Khalique is ambivalent about the development. development. Initially, he was not opposed. “I’ve seen a hell of a change from a deprived, deprived, dirty area, to a trendy, diversified, diversified, multicultural area,” said Mr. Khalique, 50. But now he worries that the new shopping shopping center will undermine the area’s architectural architectural character by adding glass features amid the weathered brick, and will siphon customers from long-established long-established stores. “It will really kill small, independent independent businesses,” he said. In a statement, Zeloof Partnership, which owns the brewery site and a handful handful of other nearby properties, said the new center would create several hundred hundred jobs, mostly for local people. Its design design was consistent with the look of the area and did not involve demolishing buildings, the statement said. It added that a fixed discount for rent would be offered to a select number of independent independent businesses currently operating operating from the brewery. The company said there was no firm date yet for when construction would start or when the new center would open. The plans have met fierce resistance from some local residents and campaigners. campaigners. The district’s member of Parliament, Rushanara Ah of the opposition Labour Party, said residents had expressed concerns concerns about the “limited concessions” made by the developers, adding that the Conservative government had reduced “local powers and accountability to local communities” over development. Opponents of the development also argue argue that it could cause rents and housing prices to rise in what has long been a working-class area. In December 2020, a “Save Brick Lane” campaign gained widespread attention attention online, in part through the participation participation of Nijjor Manush, a British Bangladeshi activist group. The borough council received more than 7,000 letters of objection, though only several hundred hundred were from local residents, a sign of what a point of contention the proposed development had become beyond just Brick Lane. In September last year, soon after Zeloof’s plans were approved, campaigners campaigners and residents marched in protest, unfurling unfurling “Save Brick Lane” banners behind behind pallbearers carrying an empty coffin coffin to represent what they describe as the corrosive effects of gentrification. Still, not everyone is opposed to the plans. “Brick Lane was dying a long time ago,” said Shams Uddin, 62, who arrived in the area from Bangladesh in 1976 and has been the proprietor of Monsoon, one of the many Bangladeshi-run curry restaurants that once flourished in the neighborhood, since 1999. Indeed, in the past 15 years, 62 percent of Brick Lane’s curry restaurants have closed because of rising rent, difficulties obtaining visas for new chefs and a lack of government support, according to a study by Runnymede Trust, a research institute focusing on racial equality. Mr. Uddin said that international travel travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic, From left: Modern office buildings and construction cranes towering over Brick Lane; Ms. Begum, who is the director of Runnymeade Trust, a research institute focusing on racial equality, says the story of Brick Lane is a “tale of two cities”; and stalls in the neighborhoods old brewery complex, behind which the new shopping mall will rise. the chilling effect of Brexit and the opening opening of franchises in a historic market area nearby had deterred customers from visiting. In this environment, he said, the new shopping center could lift up the waning businesses around it. “When customers finish their business business with the shopping center, they may come to my restaurant,” he said. “This is a good thing for our business.” The changing face of Brick Lane is startling to many longtime residents who remember the many empty properties properties in London’s East End five decades ago. “This area had been abandoned,” said Dan Cruickshank, a historian and member member of the Spitalfields Trust, a local heritage heritage and conservation group. When he bought his home in Spitalfields Spitalfields in the 1970s — a property that had stood empty for more than 10 years — Mr. Cruickshank said he struggled to secure a mortgage. East London, he said, was “deemed dark, dangerous, remote and to be avoided” by mortgage lenders and property developers. Now, in what Mr. Cruickshank derides as a “peculiar case of gentrification,” homes in Brick Lane have acquired a Midas Midas touch. Average property prices in the neighborhood have tripled in little over a decade, according to real estate agents’ collations of government data, with some soaring over millions of dollars. dollars. With the average home in London costing nearly 12 times the average salary salary in Britain, affordable housing options are scarce. For centuries, Brick Lane has been a sanctuary for minority communities: Huguenot silk weavers who fled religious religious persecution in 17th-century France, Ashkenazi Jews escaping antisemitism antisemitism and pogroms in Eastern Europe, Europe, and then Bangladeshi Muslims in the 1970s, during Bangladesh’s fight for independence from Pakistan and the ensuing ensuing violence. Since the 1990 s, it has become become a symbol of multicultural London, celebrated in novels, memoirs, movies and museum exhibits. In the 1970s, Bangladeshis were drawn to Brick Lane by cheap places to live and abundant work opportunities in the textile industry. But the arrivals were greeted by discriminatory discriminatory housing policies and occasional occasional racist violence from followers of the National Front — a far-right British political party with headquarters nearby. Racists smeared swastikas and “KKK” on some buildings. Mr. Khalique, the grocery grocery store owner, said he was permanently permanently scarred on his right leg when he was attacked in his youth by a dog belonging belonging to a National Front supporter. Hundreds of Bangladeshi families squatted in empty properties in defiance of the attacks — squatting was not then a criminal offense in England — while demanding demanding better housing options. Among those families was Halima Begum’s. Begum’s. For years, as a child, she lived in a derelict building marked for demolition until her father, a factory worker, broke into an abandoned flat close to Brick Lane. Ms. Begum lived there until she left for college. Now the director of Runnymede Trust, Ms. Begum has witnessed Brick Lane’s transformation into what she described as a “tale of two cities,” where wealthy workers from the neighboring financial district live in an area with what the charity Trust for London says are the capital’s highest child poverty rates. Overcrowding is rampant in Tower Hamlets, where more than 20,000 applicants applicants await low-income housing. Opponents Opponents of the shopping center point out that the plans do not include any social housing. “How on earth would British Bangladeshi Bangladeshi communities who are experiencing experiencing significant poverty be able to maintain maintain a lifestyle where this area develops into Manhattan?” she said, citing the gentrification of the East Village in New York City in the 1980s. “The way in which we regenerate has to be more inclusive.” PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARY TURNER FOR THE NEW YORK T MES The Brick Lane neighborhood neighborhood of East London will soon have a five-story mall, and residents worry about displacement and gentrification. The area is widely known for its curry restaurants, above, though one study found 62 percent percent of them had closed in the past 15 years. THE NEW YORK TIMES Occasionally, the pushback has gone beyond petitions and local laments. A cafe specializing in hard-to-find varieties of breakfast cereal, which some held up as the ultimate example of “hipsterfication,” “hipsterfication,” was vandalized in 2015 by anti-gentrification anti-gentrification protesters.

Aaron Mo, 39, who in July last year opened a pop-up Chinese bakery, Ong Ong Buns, near the planned development, development, is cautious about predicting the shopping center’s effect on small independent independent businesses like his. But he said he learned something instructive instructive when a nearby branch of the sandwich chain Pret A Manger unexpectedly unexpectedly closed for two weeks last year. The effect was palpable, he said: “We got more customers.” For Mr. Khalique, the concerns about gentrification go beyond business — they are also deeply personal. Outside his store, Brick Lane’s history is visible in the lampposts painted in green and red, the colors of the Bangladeshi Bangladeshi flag, and in street signs that are in both English and Bengali. “Our elders have fought really hard for this area,” he said of his father’s generation. generation. “It’s in my blood.”",1/16/2022,"('said', 'citing', 'the')","('the', 'east', 'village')","[' “How on earth would British Bangladeshi Bangladeshi communities who are experiencing experiencing significant poverty be able to maintain maintain a lifestyle where this area develops into Manhattan?” she said, citing the gentrification of the East Village in New York City in the 1980s.']", How on earth would British Bangladeshi Bangladeshi communities who are experiencing experiencing significant poverty be able to maintain maintain a lifestyle where this area develops into Manhattan she said citing the gentrification of the East Village in New York City in the 1980s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2214,2712043464,"A Season Of Five Film SciClassics SciClassics ByADAMNAYMAN | Photo Essay by SINNA NASSERI At the end of Christian Nybys 1951 sci-fi chiller “The Thing From Another World” — about an Arctic expedition whose members are stealthily decimated by an accidentally defrosted alien monster — a traumatized journalist takes to the airwaves to deliver an urgent warning. “Watch the skies ” he insists breathlessly, hinting at the possibility of a full-on invasion in the final lines. “Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.” This plea for eagle-eyed vigilance suited the postwar era of Pax Americana, in which economic prosperity was leveraged against a creeping paranoia — of threats coming from above or within. The final lines of the movie were prescient about the rise of the American science-fiction film, out of the B-movie trenches in the 1950s and into the firmament of the industry’s Alist Alist several decades later. The peak of this trajectory came in the summer of 1982, in which five authentic genre classics premiered within a onemonth onemonth span. After its June 4,1982, opening, “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” set an unexpected record by grossing about $14 million on its first weekend. Seven days later, Steven Spielberg’s “E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial” debuted to $11 million but proved to have stubby little box-office legs, eventually grossing more than half a billion dollars worldwide. June 25 brought the competing releases of Ridley Scott’s ambitious tech-noir thriller “Blade Runner” Runner” and John Carpenter’s R-rated remake of “The Thing,” visions several shades darker than “E.T.”; both flopped as a prelTop, prelTop, a replica of the DeLorean from “Back to the Future” was on display in Times Square last month.

On July 9, Disney’s technologically groundbreaking “Tron,” set in a virtual universe of videogame videogame software, completed the quintet. Not all of these movies were created equal artistically, but taken together, they made a compelling case for the increasing thematic flexibility of their genre. The range of tones and styles on display was remarkable, remarkable, from family-friendly fantasy to gory horror. Whether giving a dated primetime primetime space opera new panache or recasting 1940s noir in postmodernist monochrome, the filmmakers (and special-effects technicians) technicians) of the summer of ’82 created a sublime sublime season of sci-fi that looks, 40 years later, later, like the primal scene for many Hollywood Hollywood blockbusters being made — or remade remade and remodeled — today.

52,2719514738,"Where Tennis Soars Despite Rugged Courts A mostly Black community of players has long thrived in a high-crime part of Brooklyn. By COREY KILGANNON For two weeks every summer, the elite tennis tennis world convenes in a world-class facility for top competition, celebrity sightings and $32 lobster rolls. For this brief period, Flushing, Queens, is the center of tennis in the world. Then the tour and the players move on to San Diego, London and Seoul. But a few miles away in the middle of Brooklyn, there is a homegrown scene where tennis is played on rugged asphalt courts all year long. There, drawn to 11 modest modest public courts in Lincoln Terrace Park, is a community of players, most of them Black, that has thrived for decades despite outdated facilities, high crime rates and very little recognition. It is a world away from the Open. There is no locker room at Lincoln Terrace, and no protective bubbles for indoor play in winter. The spotty lighting leaves some courts unplayable unplayable after dark. The slick court surfaces force regulars to learn to handle severely skipping balls. There is constant clatter from subway trains running alongside the court. “It’s the most Brooklyn thing ever, to try to concentrate on returning a serve while the subway is roaring by next to you,” said one regular, Andy Goveia, 31. The courts lie on the border of Crown Heights and Brownsville, which has some of the highest crime rates in the city. In 2020, a man was fatally shot right at a court entrance. And yet the tennis itself is remarkable. Competitive matches — never mind the scene in the bleachers — can rival the Open for drama, as fleet-footed players smash serves, hammer returns and lunge for passing passing shots. The courts serve as a neighborhood gathering gathering spot for players largely of Caribbean extraction, a cultural and social hub with an unmistakable West Indian flavor. Many evenings, soca music mixes with the smell of jerk chicken and pelau, a Trinidadian Trinidadian chicken dish. An older man in Rastafarian Rastafarian garb regularly takes a spot on the sidelines selling peanuts and cold drinks. Bottles of wine and Guinness might appear. It has been like this since before the USTA National Tennis Center opened. The latest threat may be the gentrification of Crown Heights. Some regulars fear the steady increase increase in use may disrupt this tennis community’s community’s hard-won traditions. But so far, the courts remain infused with as much energy as any center court match at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The longevity of the tennis scene is thanks largely to the Lincoln Terrace Tennis Association, an expansive group of players who help maintain the park and expose local local residents to the sport with competitive tournaments and Saturday-morning clinics run by volunteer coaches and staffers. The group’s roots go back to at least the 1960s. Their clinics often draw more than 150 children and close to 100 adults, said its president, Charles East, and the annual fee of $50 for children and $60 for adults includes includes the use of loaner rackets. despite the stardom of Serena and Venus Williams and newcomers like Coco Gauff, Black tennis players are underrepresented at every level, from recreational to professional, professional, said Joan Gordon, 70, a chairwoman of the association. “It is still largely an elite, white sport,” Ms. Gordon said during a break from helping helping players on a recent Saturday morning. “So our main goal is to expose the community community to the game.” Ms. Gordon began playing at Lincoln Terrace in her youth in 1973 and had to scrimp for the $25 to buy a wooden racket. “Even today, $25 is a lot for some of these parents,” she said, as children were put through calisthenics while their parents ran through serve and volley drills on another row of courts. Even before noon the scene around the courts was lively, with dancehall music pumping through speakers and a woman serving players roasted breadfruit and codfish. “You have generations of families who have played here,” said Marva Brown, 41, whose three children went through drills nearby conducted by volunteer coaches. “This keeps tennis accessible in an innercity innercity neighborhood, so we can play this sport,” added Ms. Brown, 41, a public defender defender from Crown Heights who started playing tennis in her teens and was inspired by the rise of the Williams sisters. She helped get her children excited about tennis last winter by showing them the Will Smith film “King Richard,” about the early years of the Williams sisters on the courts of Los Angeles. While there hasn’t been a rise to stardom like the Williams sisters’, many young players introduced to tennis at Lincoln Lincoln Terrace have earned college scholarships scholarships and even played professionally. Each summer the association sends a dozen children to an upstate New York tennis tennis camp, a chance to be scouted by college coaches. Among the young players who rose up from Lincoln Terrace is Akilah James, who eventually earned a tennis scholarship to the University of Arizona, where she now coaches after having played as a touring pro. Adrian Clarke, 66, moved to New York from Barbados at 17 in the 1970s and fed off the competition at Lincoln Terrace. “You had to learn how to keep yourself safe — you had prostitution on the streets and across the street, we had the occasional murder,” said Mr. Clarke, now director of tennis for the Prospect Park Alliance. “As kids, we would be on the court and they’d warn us not to cross the street where the prostitutes and criminals were.” A scholarship lifted Mr. Clarke from the tough courts in Crown Heights to the heralded heralded Port Washington Tennis Academy in Long Island, alongside the likes of John McEnroe and Vitas Gerulaitis. After college tennis, he played professionally and earned entry to the US. Open qualifiers by winning the 1983 national championship held by the American Tennis Association, a league created created in 1916 when Black players could not play white tournaments. These days, one player to watch at Lincoln Lincoln Terrace is Autumn Clarke, 16, a promising promising junior tournament player who often hits with her talented 13-year-old brother, Levi. the parks department manages Lincoln Terrace, but much of the daily upkeep is often often handled by Mr. East and other members. members. The court lights are scheduled to turn off at 1 a.m. but they often remain lit. So an informal but tight group of regulars frequently frequently stays well past that, playing tennis and dominoes or just hanging out. The group tends to congregate in the two courts next to the one where Lincoln Terrace’s teaching pro, Eric Jordan, teaches. They play year-round, even clearing snow in the winter. When the Parks Department Department removed tennis nets citywide during the coronavirus lockdown in 2020, these regulars bought and rigged their own nets — sometimes just a length of rope — to keep playing. It helped them get through the pandemic, which hit this part of Brooklyn particularly hard. More than a dozen longtime regulars died from Covid-19 and others mobilized to help locals suffering from the virus, the players said. In the rough days of the 1990s, violent crime plagued the 77th Precinct, where the murder rate was among the highest in the city. “You had prostitution and crime — they found bodies in this park,” said Hastings Williams, 67, a retired accountant from Flatbush Flatbush who grew up in St. Kitts and Nevis and is now a regular at Lincoln Terrace. Violent crime has declined but hardly disappeared. disappeared. Mr. East said he was mugged several years back during his morning maintenance. Since then he has locked himself himself inside the courts while cleaning them. In New York, where private courts can run upward of $100 an hour, the 587 public courts in 91 city parks provide an affordable tennis alternative. But court time is highly sought-after at popular spots. Securing an hour of playing time at Central Park or in Fort Greene, for example, often involves lining lining up early in the morning just to sign up for a later hour of play. At Central Park, players follow a regimented system of hourly bells and announcements keeping play organized. At many courts, the city’s Parks Department Department assigns attendants to manage reservations, reservations, enforce playing time limits, and check for the ($100 seasonal or $15 singleday) singleday) required playing permits. But at Lincoln Terrace, there is rarely a long wait and no competitive sign-up sheet. At popular tennis spots, a Parks Department Department attendant might check players for permits. But at Lincoln Terrace, permitchecking permitchecking is lax enough that many players can get by without them. A general lack of crowds at Lincoln Terrace Terrace allows singles players to play longer than the usual one-hour time limit for singles singles at city courts. Most players are respectful about time limits when people are waiting, said a longtime longtime regular, Roger Browne, who coaches players at the courts. But sometimes newcomers newcomers have complained about players running running over their allotted time. The response, he said, is usually, “That’s the way it’s done in the hood.” And this is the way it’s done at the courts’ weekend tournaments, which are open to all comers. At a recent mixed doubles finals, the writer writer Toure, a longtime regular at the Fort Greene public courts, trolled the Lincoln Terrace crowd by wearing a custom “Toure Terrace Park” T-shirt, a teasing claim of ownership referencing the numerous titles he has won this summer at Lincoln Terrace. Toure and his playing partner, Amaya Lopez-Clay, Lopez-Clay, won their match handily, even after after a lengthy interruption by a car crash outside the courts, which seemed to be the result of an apparent car chase involving several feuding young men. Spectators ran out to watch but then, fearing gunfire, scrambled for cover. The men sped off and the finals resumed once the tennis crowd gave up on waiting for the police. But such episodes are now the exception, players said. More normal is the scene one recent night when a group of regulars rotated rotated on and off a pair of courts and enjoyed some music and snacks well into the summer summer night. “This is our country club,” Mr. Jordan, the teaching pro, said. Mr. Goveia wiped off sweat after a spirited spirited set.“New York is about making the best of what you got,” he said. “These courts aren’t aren’t the best, but we’ve made the best of what we got.”",8/28/2022,"('may', 'be', 'the')","('crown', 'heights', 'some')",[' The latest threat may be the gentrification of Crown Heights.'], The latest threat may be the gentrification of Crown Heights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JESSICA TEZAK FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES In Hollers Where She Directs Aid, They re Learning to Expect Her By TARIRO MZEZEWA Margo Miller, the executive director of the Appalachian Community Fund, describes describes herself as a “proud Black mountain mountain woman” in a region not widely known for being home to generations of Black people. In her day-to-day work, Ms. Miller, 53, is in charge of financially supporting regional regional organizations, individuals and groups working to advance social, economic, economic, racial and environmental justice across Appalachia. The largely economically economically depressed region is a vast swath of land that encompasses some or all of 13 states, including parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, Maryland and all of West Virginia. Support from the fund is sometimes a couple hundred dollars and other times $5,000 or more, depending on the year and the causes. In 2021, the organization gave out more than $600,000 to organizations, individuals individuals and groups in Appalachia, where the often stunning landscape consists consists of family farms, twisting back roads, steep mountain passes and fairly secluded communities, some with newly revitalized downtowns. Since its inception inception in 1987, the fund has given away more than $6 million. Ms. Miller said that lately it had been getting a lot more support support from a diverse array of donors. “Our range is 50 cents to $50,000,” she said. “We have a donor who would tape quarters inside of an envelope and send it to us.” One year, she added, another regular donor sent a gift of $50,000, “saying, “saying, T know the region can really use this gift this year.’ ” Ms. Miller, who lives in East Knoxville, has become one of the most powerful people in philanthropy in a rapidly evolving evolving region that has long been marred by stereotypes, misunderstanding and, for Black people, erasure, according to academics academics and leaders of nonprofit groups. Many Black people, including Ms. Miller’s family, have lived in Southern Appalachia and Central Appalachia for at least three generations (she had relatives relatives who worked in Kentucky’s coal mines), but their stories are not often told. Instead, the Appalachia portrayed in popular culture tends to be largely associated associated with stories of white coal miners and their families, a narrative that several several scholars, sociologists, artists and residents, Ms. Miller among them, have been working hard to shift. Dr. Enkeshi El-Amin, an assistant professor professor of sociology at West Virginia University, University, doesn’t remember exactly when or how she met Ms. Miller, but she does recall hearing about her since her earliest earliest days of living in Knoxville in 2013. “Margo’s name was one of those names that you just knew,” said Dr. ElAmin, ElAmin, whose academic work focuses on how “racial practices shape Black places and how Black people are, in turn, involved involved in practices that define, contest and reimagine places.” Ms. Miller, she said, “is sort of like an O.G.” She added, “Her name was always there, which tells you a lot.” Ms. Miller, in fact, has always been a natural leader, whether she realized it or not. As a child growing up among the mountains and hollows, or hollers as the valleys are colloquially called, of Roane County, Tenn., and later in North Knoxville, she said, she was “the bossy one who wanted to play the teacher.” In her mostly white elementary school, she was student of the year (the first Black student to receive the title), and in high school she was class president (the first Black student to hold the position). She is a self-professed nerd. “Being a nerd is kind of trendy now, but back then it wasn’t the case,” she said in a recent interview from her office, surrounded surrounded by crafting supplies. She’s a big crafter too. “I definitely was a kid who had my nose buried in a book. Standing nearly 5 feet 10 inches, Ms. Miller today knows how to command a room, whether she is speaking or not. But she recalled that the earliest days of her career as an administrator were more challenging, in part, because she is a Black woman. She talks of going on job interviews in the 1990s and white men being surprised when she entered the room. Some would start to say, “I wasn’t expecting you....” and she would have a ready comeback. “Back then, I would laugh and say: T know. You weren’t expecting me to be so tall,” she said. “I would really try to make them feel more comfortable and they’d EBONY BLEVINS Ms. Miller presenting a plan to bring more resources to disenfranchised communities of color in Appalachia in 2014.

I’m waiting waiting for a white Margo Miller.’ ” Those experiences experiences were demoralizing, but she found joy, support and opportunities to grow in Knoxville’s theater community, where she was surrounded by other Black people. She had immersed herself in theater while in college there and became became a performer and stage manager. Ms. Miller said her experiences with racism were not the same today. “I’m currently surrounded by a community of social justice folks who are all about equity equity and inclusion and anti-racist practice,” she said. “I’m fortunate and do not have the same experience of other sisters who work for mostly white boards and trustees. Many of them have uphill battles.” battles.” African Americans make up about 10 percent of Appalachia’s population while those identifying as Hispanic or Latino account for 5.6 percent of the population, a number that is growing, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission. Still, sociologists and historians said, Black and Latino people with roots in Appalachia Appalachia have a deep connection to the area and their rich history should be studied and appreciated. People like Ms. JESSICA TEZAK FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Ms. Miller’s fabric shelves in her craft room at her home in East Knoxville, Tenn. She said she had been an avid crafter since childhood. Miller, who are connected to the region’s history, help with this effort, they said. “You get coal mining stories or you’ll hear of good race relations here because there weren’t many Black folks here, but those stories distort,” Dr. El-Amin, of West Virginia University, said. “Black folks have always been in the region. From slavery on up.” The fund that Ms. Miller heads supports supports all Appalachians, regardless of race, gender, sexuality or other identities, identities, but under her leadership, which started in 2011, minority Appalachians say they have felt more included. For them, merely seeing a Black woman who is committed to the growth and development development of the area is a comfort and source of encouragement. Richard Graves, an artist in Abingdon, Va, a 2021 recipient of $5,000 from the community fund’s fellowship program said that the money made it possible for him to find stability during the first year he worked as an artist full-time. The foundation gave a total of $80,000 to fellows fellows like Mr. Graves. But even more valuable than the financial support, he said, was the community support that came with being in the fund’s network. “Because of how sectioned and pocketed pocketed off these rural communities are, doing doing community work together can be hard,” he said. “It gave me faces and names of people across the region. We met on Zoom every two weeks and continue continue to keep in touch.” Strengthening community and bringing bringing people together is one of Ms. Miller’s strongest qualities, according to several organizers and beneficiaries of the organization’s organization’s fund. “Margo has been a field builder making making space for nonwhite voices, nonwhite leadership in the region, in central Appalachia,” Appalachia,” Lora Smith, the chief strategy officer for the Foundation for Appalachian Appalachian Kentucky, said. “She is as unapologetically unapologetically Appalachian as she is unapologetically unapologetically a Black woman leading a community fund.” Ms. Smith, who took over Ms. Miller’s seat as the co-chair of the Appalachian Funders Network, a nonprofit, said that beyond her professional qualifications, Ms. Miller leads with care, openness and vulnerability. She recalled a meeting in which Ms. Miller unexpectedly took words participants had written and combined combined them into a powerful poem and Ms. Miller said she relished having access to the natural beauty that abounds in Appalachia, which she celebrates as an artist and social and environmental justice activist. read it aloud. Ms. Miller has been writing poetry and been an avid crafter since childhood. She’s also a D.J. “It was amazing to then see how people people responded to that in a very humanistic humanistic way and the vulnerability and openness openness that her openness brings out in others,” others,” Ms. Smith said. “She leads from a place of courageous joy. The Appalachian Appalachian Community Fund resources some of the most forward-thinking and radical work in Appalachia and has done so for decades. That takes a courageous leader who is rooted in her values and can take critique and blowback when it comes.” Ms. Miller’s generosity extends beyond beyond the workplace, according to stories from Black activists, organizers and scholars. Dr. El-Amin recalled sharing in early 2021 that she was concerned about whether The Bottom, a space she had created for Black people to gather, study and experience culture together, would survive amid the gentrification of East Knoxville. She worried that they would not be able to afford to keep the space. “Margo said, T will take the equity out of my house for you all to buy the building,”’ building,”’ Dr. El-Amin recalled. “This is something I will forever remember and she did it.” To Dr. El-Amin, this was yet another example of Ms. Miller’s commitment commitment to fostering Black history, voices and safety in the community. “I’m grateful that I was in a position to make the purchase happen,” Ms. Miller said, adding that the line of equity loan was repaid in less than a year, and that she then signed a deed to remove herself from ownership of the building. Ms. Smith said she judges how good executive directors are by how well-received well-received they are by their younger employees employees and collaborators. The best leaders, she said, engage with young people who may have different ways of thinking and may push them beyond their comfort zones. Ms. Miller, she said, is one of these leaders. “She embraces next-generation leadership leadership and is actively standing with and supporting younger people,” Ms. Smith said, “especially Black, Brown and queer folks, in stepping into their power and leading the region forward.” For her part, Ms. Miller said she anticipated anticipated that she would stay in her role for another year or so, but felt that she was ready to seek out new challenges. “I want to figure out who I want to be when I grow up,” she said. “I think in order order to serve in the next leg of whatever I do, I need to take the time to rest and welcome welcome the next generation of philanthropic philanthropic leaders.”",12/13/2022,"('survive', 'amid', 'the')","('east', 'knoxville', 'she')","[' El-Amin recalled sharing in early 2021 that she was concerned about whether The Bottom, a space she had created for Black people to gather, study and experience culture together, would survive amid the gentrification of East Knoxville.']", ElAmin recalled sharing in early 2021 that she was concerned about whether The Bottom a space she had created for Black people to gather study and experience culture together would survive amid the gentrification of East Knoxville,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
