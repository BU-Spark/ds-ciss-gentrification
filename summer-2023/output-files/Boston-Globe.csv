1441,1976110991,"Study finds US cities are becoming more racially integrated Authors caution against calling end of all segregation By Sam Roberts NEW YORK TIMES NEW YORK - More than 40 years after the federal government government enacted fair-housing legislation legislation and the Great Migration of blacks from the South began to ebb, residential segregation in metropolitan America has been significantly curtailed, according to a study released yesterday. The study of census results from thousands of neighborhoods neighborhoods by two economics professors professors who are fellows at the Manhattan Manhattan Institute, a conservative icsearch organization, found that the nation’s cities are more racially integrated than at any time since 1910; that all-white enclaves ?are effectively extinct”; and that while black urban ghettos ghettos still exist, they are shriveling. An influx of immigrants and the gentrification of black neighborhoods neighborhoods contributed to the change, the study said, but suburbanization suburbanization by blacks was even more instrumental. The progress was less pronounced pronounced between blacks and non-Hispanic whites, though, than it has been between blacks and other ethnicities, including Asians and Hispanics. The findings by Edward Glaeser of Harvard and Jacob L Yigdor of Duke were generally econded by a spectrum of other experts with several caveats and an admonition that the study should not be seen as declaring the end of all segregation. Also, barriers like exclusionary exclusionary zoning in the suburbs persist, and the decline in busing to achieve racial integration means that some public schools are more segregated than before. ?There is now very much more black-white neighborhood integration than 40 years ago,” said professor Reynolds Farley of the University of Michigan’s Population Population Studies Center. “Those of us who worked on segregation in the 1960s never anticipated such declines. Nevertheless, blacks remain remain considerably more segreFew segreFew customers willing to pay NStar more for wind energy ► ELECTRICITY Continued from Page AI their environmental ideals ml^ht be. For several years, the Boston University? biology professor has been going door to door in his neighborhood to plug the NStar program. When a door opened one night last week, he urged a young man to sign up. “This is the single, simplest way you could cut a lot of carbon dioxide from your household,” Loechler said. But after he explained that enrolling enrolling would add between 15 percent and 30 percent to his neighbor’s electric bill, the 22year-old 22year-old thanked him for promoting promoting what sounded like a good idea. ‘But it’s probably too much ?the man said. It was a response Loechler, who moonlights as coordinator of Climate Action Brookline, has heard over and over again. “I’m sympathetic to people who don’t want to spend money,” he said, ?but it can be discouraging.” When NStar announced the program in 2007, it launched a public relations campaign that included billboards, advertisements advertisements on their trucks and website, website, bill inserts, and significant media attention. Utility executives explained how their customers would be able to buy half or all their power from wind farms in Maine and upstate New York, for up to 7 percent percent more than they would pay for regular service that came from such energy sources as coal and natural gas. Generating electricity electricity from such fossil fuels releases releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, atmosphere, which scientists say contributes to global warming. NStar signed two 10-year contracts contracts to buy 60 megawatts of power, enough to power tens of thousands of homes and small businesses, or 2 percent of the utility?s overall demand. At the time, NStar chief executive Thomas J. May said he hoped the gated from whites than do Hispanics Hispanics or Asians.? Douglas Massey, a Princeton sociologist, said, ?In terms of trends in black-white segregation, segregation, w r e really see two trends: In metro areas with small black populations, we indeed observed sharp decreases in segregation; but in those with large black populations, populations, the declines are much slower and at times nonexistent. Although all white neighborhoods neighborhoods have largely disappeared, this is more due to the entry of Latinos and Asians into formerly all-white neighborhoods.” John R. I?ogan, a Brown sociologist, sociologist, said, ?If w r e want to understand understand the long-term trends in segregation, we have to be aware both of the progress and of the resistance to change. We are far from the ‘end of segregation.’ ” Still, Glaeser and Vigdor found that only 20 percent of blacks now live in “ghetto? neighborhoods neighborhoods where 80 percent of the population or more is black, compared with nearly 50 percent who lived in similar neighborhoods neighborhoods a half-century ago. The findings in the report, titled titled “The End of the Segregated Century,” for the Manhattan Institute’s Institute’s Center for State and Local Local Leadership did not denigrate decades of desegregation efforts. In fact, the authors said, ?there is every reason to relish the fact that there is more freedom in housing today than 50 years ago and to applaud those who fought to create the change.? But they concluded that housing desegregation desegregation was not a magic bullet in providing equal opportunity. “Residential segregation has declined pervasively, as ghettos depopulate and the nation’s population population center shifts toward the less segregated Sun Belt.” Glaeser and Vigdor wTote. ?At the same time, there has been only limited progress in closing achievement and employment gaps between blacks and whites.? While the decline in New York and St. Louis was ?not very profound,” profound,” Vigdor said, new neighborhoods neighborhoods like the Washington Navy Yard in the District of Columbia Columbia shifted to 31 percent black in 2010 from 95 percent black in 2000. program would be oversubscribed oversubscribed and that the company would have to buy more renewable renewable energy. What May and other executives executives didn’t expect, however, was that the price of dirtier fuels would plummet. The premium charged for the Green program also dropped, but not as much, making the wind energy relatively relatively more expensive. NStar eventually had to ask the state for permission to raise its rates for tle Green program to break even. ?As prices for traditional traditional power fell, leading to a corresponding corresponding drop in the basic service price, the Green premium had to be increased to continue to cover costs,” said Michael Durand, an NStar spokesman. The program met expectations expectations in the beginning, as about 8,000 customers signed up in little little more than a year, Durand said. The company had hoped to enroll 10,000 customers within the first two years, but enrollment enrollment fell. Today, with fewer than 6,800 customers in the program, a typical typical family buying all its power from the wind farms pays about $23.94 more per month than a basic service customer, or about 30 percent extra when delivery charges are included. Those rates will increase again in March by $8 for customers buying all their power from the Green program. ?We wouldn’t want to speculate speculate why participation hasn’t been more robust,? Durand said, noting they have enough wind farm capacity to support three times the number of customers now enrolled in the program. State officials say they saw the NStar program as a potential model for other utilities, many of which have allowed customers to buy so-called renewable energy credits that indirectly subsidize the cost of other companies building anything from solar stations stations to hydroelectric plants.

In Massachusetts, Commissioner Commissioner Mark Sylvia of the state Department of Energy Resources said he saw NStar’s program as a way to help the state increase the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy, now 8 JAVIER ZARRACINA/GI.OBE STAFF percent. His colleagues at the state Department of Public Utilities Utilities last week hosted a meeting with utility executives to discuss how to boost consumer interest and make their renewable energy programs more accessible and easier to understand. ?The fact that these options are even available is very important, important, but of course, we would love to see a higher utilization rate,” Sylvia said Some environmentalists argue argue that NStar hasn’t done enough to promote its Green program program and suggest the company was more interested the good publicity of appearing to care for the environment. ?I’m really disappointed they haven’t done better.” said Alan Nogee, a clean energy consultant and former director of the Union of Concern Scientists in Cambridge, Cambridge, who helped design NStar Green. “The biggest disappointment disappointment is that they didn’t really engage engage the community?. The key to making this kind of program work for a private utility is to have good marketing partners. We thought they would take that approach, but they didn’t.” State Representative Frank Smizik, a Brookline Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change, also criticized NStar. “They don’t publicize the program program enough, and therefore, consumers don’t really know about it,? he said. “I thought when NStar started this they would be a leader in green energy. energy. But that hasn’t happened.” NStar’s Durand said it was normal to scale back publicity after after the launch of a program. As Loechler knocked on doors last week to spread the word about the program - he has no affiliation with NStar other than being a customer and an advocate advocate for renewable energy — he met mainly blank stares and polite polite rejection. He blames NStar, calling language language about the Green program on the website ?baffling, loquacious, loquacious, and obtuse.? But he continues continues to promote the program. At the final home he visited last week, Loechler found a receptive receptive ear in Deborah and Archon Archon Fung, who said they had been discussing how to reduce their carbon footprint with their children. They were surprised at the cost of the program, but have decided to get half their power from wind energy. “I do care about global warming. warming. and it’s probably the right thing to do,?

Lawsuit says FDA monitored e-mails Agency workers filed complaints By Nedra Pickier ASSOCIATED PRESS WASHINGTON — Current and former Food and Drug Administration Administration officials say in a lawsuit lawsuit that the agency secretly monitored monitored their private e-mail after they raised concerns that approved approved medical devices might risk public safety. The doctors and scientists who researched the products approached approached members of Congress and the incoming Obama administration administration to express alarm that the devices were approved over their objections. Their lawsuit contends that the agency monitored e-mail sent from their personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts from work computers computers over tw?o years. It says those e-mails included messages to congressional staff and drafts of whistle-blow?er complaints. The staffers say they were legally legally protected whistle-blowers and the monitoring violated their constitutional rights to free speech and against illegal search and seizure, even though a waming waming on FDA computers said they had no expectation to privacy. The defendants say they were admonished admonished or lost their contracts with the FDA in retaliation. The FDA said yesterday it would not comment on ongoing litigation. The lawsuit says the plaintiffs were among those who complained in fall 2008 to members members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that senior senior managers at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health ‘‘ordered, intimidated, and coerced coerced FDA experts to modify their scientific reviews, conclusions, conclusions, and recommendations in violation of the law.’’ Then in January 2009, after President Obama’s election but before he was sworn into office, nine FDA employees sent a letter to the Obama transition team complaining of corruption within within the FDA device review process that they said was endangering public health. For example, the FDA scientists scientists alleged that the agency approved approved the use of computer-aided computer-aided detection devices with breast mammograms even though they had been determined not to be safe or effective, harming women and resulting in unnecessary public health costs. The suit says FDA officials began began secretly referring to the letter’s letter’s signatories as the “FDA 9” and began the secret monitoring. The suit says the agency used spyware on its governmentowned governmentowned computers that allowed it to take pictures of what was on their computer screens without their knowledge. The scientists’ complaints were the subject of a New York Times article on March 28, 2010, that said the FDA brushed aside its own experts’ warnings about the risks of radiation exposure from routinely using powerful CT scans to screen patients for colon cancer. The lawsuit says lawyers for General Electric Co., which applied applied for agency approval of CT scans for colon cancer screenings, screenings, complained that confidential confidential information may have been leaked to the Times. Agency officials used the letter to make a criminal referral to the Office of Inspector General and attempt to have the plaintiffs investigated investigated and potentially charged with serious crimes, the suit says. But the office found no evidence of criminal conduct and noted that disclosures relating to public safety to Congress and the media were protected whistleblower whistleblower activity. The lawyer who filed the suit, Stephen Kohn, National Whistleblowers Whistleblowers Center executive director, director, said spying on employees who raise health concerns stops others from coming forward in the interest of public safety. ?The FDA’s illegal spying program program is not just a problem for the six victims in this case,” Kohn said in a statement yesterday. ?The day we allow the government government to spy on employees based on their lawful whistle-blower activities activities is the day we give up privacy privacy for every honest public servant servant in America.? _ i.",1/31/2012,"('immigrants', 'and', 'the')","('black', 'neighborhoods', 'neighborhoods')","[' An influx of immigrants and the gentrification of black neighborhoods neighborhoods contributed to the change, the study said, but suburbanization suburbanization by blacks was even more instrumental.']", An influx of immigrants and the gentrification of black neighborhoods neighborhoods contributed to the change the study said but suburbanization suburbanization by blacks was even more instrumental,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1622,928777474,"Note: If you go  . . . Fiercely proud of its traditions, it still embraces tasteful newcomers along with hearty stalwarts South Boston may be in the throes of gentrification, but some things never change. It's an annual rite of spring, more reliable than the first robin at the bird feeder: When Sullivan's at Castle Island starts serving its ""trifecta"" of hot dog, fries, and an ice cream cone, it's time for all South Boston to return to Southie's shore. Opening day last month proved too blustery for the otherwise obligatory stroll around Pleasure Bay, but neighborhood residents descended on the food bar like seagulls on a french fry. Two hardy souls in the parking lot were donning wet suits, presumably for a scuba dive, but it was otherwise too chilly for anyone but an L Street Brownie to risk wading into the water. Southie is surrounded on three sides by Boston Harbor, and the beaches circle the rim of City Point like salt on a margarita glass. South Boston's residential portion all lies south of First Street in two grids set at a 45-degree angle to each other. ""No other area has so much open space,"" says Kevin McCarthy, proprietor of Vintage Southie on West Broadway. ""The beach  - it's an unusual gift to have something like that."" McCarthy's collectibles shop is not near the beaches at City Point, but sits instead on West Broadway in the part of Southie that old-timers call the Lower End. Real estate agents have repackaged the district as the ""West Side,"" or less frequently, the ""City Side."" From the shop's door you can look down Broadway straight to the South End, where McCarthy hails from originally. He married a girl from South Boston, he explains. ""I was married a month and I was over the bridge."" That was 27 years ago, but his wife still thinks of him as an outsider not really qualified to offer opinions on the neighborhood. Yet it would be hard to find someone more appreciative of South Boston than McCarthy, who sells framed reproductions of vintage South Boston postcard scenes in his shop. As a veteran of the South End, he is resigned to change, even as he laments that gentrification often displaces the elderly and low-income residents. ""You can't stop change. You have to change along with it,"" he muses. ""It's getting a lot funkier and fun than it used to be."" Certainly nothing can replace neighborhood stalwarts like Woody's L Street Tavern (now complete with ""Good Will Hunting"" memorabilia and stories of visits by Travel Channel star Anthony Bourdain and former celeb couple Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez) or Amrheins Restaurant (since 1890), with its shamrock-filled windows, hand-carved bar, and popular Sunday brunch. But in the last few years, the corned-beef-and-cabbage beer bar known as the Farragut House has been replaced by gastropub Local 149, which has Belgium's McChouffe on tap and Quebec's Le Fin du Monde in oversize bottles. The bartenders offer classes in mixology; the chef teaches pickling; and the menu features chorizo cassoulet and Arctic char with black pepper and dill dumplings. Food, it seems, is one of the surest indicators of change and has certainly kicked the ""fun"" level up a notch or two in South Boston. At the opposite end of the neighborhood, Sam Jackson opened KO Catering and Pies to introduce Australian-style savory pies to Boston about 18 months ago. His folding sign out front greets potential customers with a perky ""G'day."" Lovely short-crust-lined pie plates filled with various stews (beef, braised lamb shank and vegetables, even curried vegetables) and topped with puff pastry find a ready audience. ""I have a lot of South Boston born and bred customers who love the food,"" Jackson says. ""A lot of Irish customers love the food."" But they have to be taught to douse the pies in ketchup. ""That's very Australian,"" he says with a shrug. Jackson has lived in South Boston for five years. ""This end of Broadway has changed,"" he says. ""There's more going on  - you just have to look around. Finding a parking spot is still the same challenge."" Jackson may be a proponent of Aussie pies, but he's also a fan of the roast beef sandwiches at Liberty Bell, which come with a special mouth-warming barbecue sauce. The shop opened in 1976 and has been run by the same family since 1979. Employees of other area businesses also stop by Liberty for a bite. Not only does it serve great roast beef, it has a parking lot. Few places so spell out South Boston's changing lifestyle as American Provisions, the gourmet shop that opened in late 2010 just a crumpet's throw from Southie's mainstay grocer, Stop & Shop. True to its name, the preponderance of the provender is American and much is even closer to home. Linni Krall, who does a lot of the buying for the shop, makes a point of featuring products as local as Somerville's Taza chocolate or Narragansett Creamery's yogurt. The cheese case features an array of predominantly New England artisan cheeses, including Doug Erb's Caerphilly style from Landaff, N.H., the tomme from Robie Farm in Piermont, N.H., or Bailey Hazen Blue from Jasper Hill in Greensboro, Vt. Combine those scrumptious cheeses with the sausages, prosciutto, and pates in the adjoining cold case and you have the makings of a dinner party. For dessert? That's a few blocks west at Blue Tierra Chocolate Cafe, opened by Jen Turner in March 2010. She makes some astonishingly good chocolates, like her signature creme fraiche milk chocolate ganache enrobed in dark chocolate, or the very popular BLT, which consists of dark chocolate ganache with crispy bacon and maple syrup, also enrobed in dark chocolate. Turner also makes pastries and serves fancy coffees and teas, which perfectly complement another of her signature sweets: French macarons. She has lived in South Boston for seven years, and notes that the neighborhood is changing fast, citing a new wine shop and a new grocer that are poised to open soon. ""And a new sushi restaurant just opened days ago,"" Turner says with obvious enthusiasm. The little jewel box called Moko Japanese Cuisine seems to be the talk of the neighborhood. A polished bar lines one side of the restaurant, with tables set with white linens on the other. Chefs work at the sushi bar in back. The atmosphere is downright serene. Chef-owner Joy Lee also operates Samurai Boston in Back Bay, but she has chosen to live in South Boston. ""I love this neighborhood,"" Lee says. ""Compared to Back Bay, the customers are more relaxed and more calm."" Patricia Harris and David Lyon can be reached at harris.lyon@verizon.net.

192,928853935,"On a warm afternoon last week, Maura Gavaghan stood at Castle Island, a tripod sticking out from a bag on her shoulder, her eyes scanning the faces lined up for hot dogs at Sullivan's. She had come to South Boston to scout talent for a reality television show that she is hoping to develop for Viacom, which owns VH1 and MTV. She's calling it ""Dirty Water: The Real South Boston."" There has been a lot of talk about the ""real"" South Boston lately, and a lot of reality show producers combing the neighborhood claiming they are the ones that are going to reveal it. That is because Southie, Hollywood's favorite neighborhood, is the centerpiece of a full-scale reality show war. At least five potential shows have been snooping around in recent months, and despite a reception from the neighborhood that has ranged from cold to ""I'll tell you where you can go,"" a few of the shows have a real shot of getting on the air as early as this fall. Powderhouse Productions of Somerville has already cast an old Southie family to be the focal point of its show and were filming at the family's East Broadway home during Sunday's   St. Patrick's Day parade. The show will feature Leah Lentini Winters, a probation officer, her mother, Camille Niedzwiecki, who lives on the floor above with her husband, and other members of the extended family  in and around the neighborhood. Another production house is said to be working on a deal for a show centered around a boxing gym owned by famed local trainer, Peter Welch. And the producers of ""Jersey Shore"" reportedly have a deal with TLC for a show about Southie women. Hollywood, it seems, is not done with its Southie fascination. Instead, it appears as though it is about to go to another level. But the producers are running into problems, chief among them the fact that many in this famously insular neighborhood want nothing to do with reality TV. Gavaghan, who grew up in Quincy but has deep family ties in Southie, said many of her relatives think it is a horrible idea. ""Nobody wants their community to be portrayed in a negative way, and for the most part, that's what reality television is known for,"" said Nick Collins, a state representative from the neighborhood. ""It's driven by controversy. That's what sells. And that's what most people fear with this."" That feeling only intensified when 495 Productions, the makers of ""Jersey Shore,"" got in the game last month, bringing with it the fear that Southie was about to be New Jerseyed. Collins, like many in the neighborhood, thinks that Hollywood's does not have a clue about the ""real"" South Boston and is searching for a reality that does not exist anymore, or maybe never existed outside the fictional reality Hollywood created in movies like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""The Departed,"" or the satirical ""Real Housewives of South Boston"" videos that have become a YouTube sensation. Gavaghan's concept, to explore the gentrification that has swept the neighborhood over the last 15 years by focusing on the often-contentious relationship between natives and newcomers began as part of a class at New York University, where she is a senior. When news of all the other shows broke, the pitch quickly gained traction within the television industry and Gavaghan, 21,  was dispatched to town during her spring break to see if she could leverage her local connections to get people to agree to be on film. So far, she has had lots of interest from the newcomers  but little from the locals. Powderhouse Productions has been trying a similar approach, touting its local connection  - ""We're at the other end of the Red Line,"" Tug Yourgrau, the president of Powderhouse, likes to point out  - and track record for serious work, to gain the trust of locals. But their concept, to follow an extended family living in a three-decker, was met with raised eyebrows. ""They sent me the press release, and I said, `You're going to have a hard time casting that because it really doesn't exist anymore,' "" said Maureen Dahill, the editor of the local website Caught in Southie. Yourgrau admits his casting team struggled to find a family that fit its criteria  - the Winters-Niedzwiecki house has three stories, but is not a classic three-decker  - and sat down with lots of compelling families that ultimately chose not to participate. But, he said, his casting team was able to find a family they were happy with. But as news of the choice of the Winters-Niedzwiecki family spread through the neighborhood, there was considerable grumbling because Michael Lentini, a half-brother of Leah Lentini Winters, was a longtime drug addict who died in November. Winters said her brother  contracted a MRSA staph infection in a halfway house and died shortly after. Terrence Hayes, a Los Angeles  filmmaker who grew up in South Boston, said all of the shows are ""20 years late to the party,"" but  got involved with the Powderhouse project as a consultant when it was apparent  a Southie reality show was inevitable. ""I would rather somebody who was born and raised there be involved to serve as the moral compass, if you will, to dismiss the myths and stereotypes,"" Hayes said. ""I know what I'm doing. I care about the community. And this family is literally eight houses away from the house where I grew up. I'm not out to exploit Southie or portray it in a bad light; I want this to be an honest look at a family from Southie dealing with the gentrification of the neighborhood."" 495 Productions, the folks behind the controversial MTV series, ""Jersey Shore,"" did not respond to interview requests from the Globe. But their series, titled ""Southie Pride,"" has been met with the cold shoulder. Dahill, whose website has become a clearinghouse for all the reality show news and rumors, said the 495 producers have had to expand their search outside the neighborhood. It is something, Dahill points out, they did shamelessly when casting their ""New Jersey"" show; only two of the eight cast members are actually from the state. Another reality show concept that had the whiff of the popular ""Real Housewives"" franchise and was being scouted by Boston Casting appears to have faded. ""They wanted good-looking women who were still a little rough and outspoken,"" said Dahill, who interviewed for the show with friends and was glad it died when she got a sense of what they were looking for. But with 495 and Powderhouse closing in on production, and a third show  - centered around boxers at Peter Welch's Gym  - close to finalizing a deal, it appears that Southie is  going to have its reality show moment, whether people like it or not. ""Some people say, `Good for you,' "" Winters said of the reception she has been getting as news of her show spread in  the neighborhood. ""Other people say, `Why are you doing that?!'

A cross-shaped grid of floating platforms would carry hundreds of acres of soaring block-like buildings and public plazas. The site, stretching from Dorchester's Columbia Point out to one of the harbor islands, would first serve as a site for the 1976 World Expo, attracting visitors from around the world. Then it would become home to a brand-new neighborhood with housing for tens of thousands, public space designed to be a modern version of Boston Common, and a new subway line.             It was perhaps the most dramatic reimagining of Boston's landscape in the past half-century. It never happened, of course: The plan fell victim to local politics, and the very idea of a 1976 World Expo disintegrated as the country became caught up in the political and economic uncertainty of the era.             But now this all-but-forgotten plan has resurfaced at the center of a conversation about whether it's time for Boston to reclaim that sense of vision. The World Expo site was the heart of the inaugural exhibit at the Boston Society of Architects' new public space near the waterfront. The exhibit's curators--a group of young architects who also curate the pinkcomma gallery in the South End--and a handful of other thinkers citywide are taking a fresh look at the big planning era of the 1950s and '60s, an age when Boston still dared to dream big and offer sweeping visions of what the city's future might be.             Today that era of big planning is known chiefly for the damage it did, the high-handed urban renewal programs that scarred Boston with the memories of demolished neighborhoods and soulless rebuilding. The city and its residents have spent decades understandably wary of such ideas. But these critics point out that the city's 40-year turn away from that kind of broad vision has also cost us opportunities in developing Boston's neighborhoods. At a time when Boston seems hamstrung by a piecemeal planning process that leaves the city vulnerable to the whims and fortunes of individual building developers, it's worth asking if the city needs a different approach to shape its future. And that question has many people reexamining the expo plan--a bold and optimistic souvenir of a time when Boston wasn't afraid to look ahead.                         It might seemsurprising that something as dramatic as a floating neighborhood would ever be proposed in Boston, but the city had a long history of building outward to the water. Huge swaths of Boston--the Seaport, the South End, the Back Bay, and much of Dor-ches-ter--are land reclaimed from the ocean and from tidal flats.             In the late 1960s, planners started asking: Why stop there? The catalyst for the idea was a planned Bicentennial Exposition, a federally funded celebration of the nation's 200th birthday that Boston hoped to compete to host. At stake for the winning city was a huge pot of money from the federal government--more than $1 billion.             Gilbert H. Hood Jr., president of H. P. Hood & Sons, had launched a group in 1963 to advocate for Boston as the national site for the exhibition, and the group ramped up its efforts after seeing the success of Montreal's World Expo in 1967. Its members commissioned a graphic symbol by designers Herman and Lees Associates, and chose a theme: ""The Interdependence of Man.'' They initially wanted to build the site on landfill in the harbor. At that point, the Boston Redevelopment Authority created a group in 1968 to lead the design.             At the time, Jan Wampler was an idealistic architect just shy of 30. He had worked for the BRA for a few years before spending two years in Puerto Rico. He returned to the city in need of a job, and he inquired at his former employer. ""At the time, they wanted someone to draw a perspective of the proposed world's fair, based on Montreal,'' says Wampler, who is now an architecture professor at MIT. Instead, he asked for two weeks to come up with something different. ""I wanted to see the fair as a way to solve problems, urban problems at the time.''             He envisioned the fair as a living urban laboratory, in which countries and corporations would be invited to showcase research on ways to improve the city. He imagined that Japan might build a forward-thinking train system, General Motors could exhibit an electric car, and the construction industry could build innovative housing that would remain as a legacy for the city.             Although his plan went against a trend toward more overt commercialism at such expos, his bosses agreed. Wampler was put in charge of a small team of young architects under Charles Hilgenhurst, urban design director of the BRA.             By the 1960s, people had become worried about the ecological effects of massive landfills like the ones that built the Seaport District and other Boston neighborhoods, so Wampler offered a different approach: building on platforms tethered to the seafloor. The design was a geometric, Modernist vision, a grid extending out into the water all the way to Thompson Island. The grid was as a framework for various modular buildings, which would fill in the grid's squares. It was meant to be a flexible system, the contents of which could change over time.             The new section of the city would connect Columbia Point to Thompson Island. There would be a subway line from South Station, minitransit around the man-made island, space for a commuter campus of the University of Massachusetts--the current UMass Boston campus was still years away--and a climate-controlled geodesic dome for public use on Thompson Island. The total site including the island would span 690 acres, comparable to the size of Beacon Hill, with 351 acres of open space, including parks, exhibition areas, and museums, plus visitor housing that would later be transformed into housing for low-, middle-, and high-income residents--a new community of 45,000.             Although private businesspeople like Hood were instrumental in pushing for the project, seeing through a project of such scale required a powerful central planning authority, and Boston had one at the time. The Boston Redevelopment Authority had been created in the late 1950s because the city needed a powerful agency to get the federal dollars it sought for renewal projects. But it truly gained force in the 1960s, after Mayor John F. Collins brought in city planner Edward J. Logue as director. Logue pushed for an agency that combined planning and redevelopment under one roof, marrying a vision for the city's future with the power to make it happen. ""He felt that only that kind of concentrated authority would be able to turn around Boston, with its decades of decline and entrenched politics,'' says Lizabeth Cohen, a historian at Harvard and dean of the Radcliffe Institute.             By then, Boston's midcentury renewal efforts were well underway, a series of drastic projects designed to revive an ailing city whose upper- and middle-class residents had been fleeing to suburbs. ""The city was in really terrible shape by the late 1950s,'' Cohen says. In 1954, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works constructed the Central Artery that sliced through downtown. In the late 1950s, the newly formed BRA bulldozed the brick tenements and shops of Boston's West End to create the privately developed Charles River Park high-rise apartments. When Logue took charge, he wanted to differentiate his plans from the controversial West End project underway; he instead oversaw the razing of Scollay Square, the city's red-light district, to be replaced with a ""Government Center'' that would help revive downtown using the power and dollars of city, state, and federal government.             Despite the misgivings stirred by those previous projects, Bostonians apparently still had a taste for ambitious ideas. The expo proposal enjoyed wide support through the city--a 1969 poll found that 77 percent of Boston residents supported it. But it also attracted powerful opponents. At the forefront of the opposition was Louise Day Hicks, a South Boston politician who had just lost the mayoral race to Kevin White, and is most known for opposing desegregation of Boston's public schools. In May of 1969, she led a public meeting to protest the move.             The opposition came to focus on the argument that the construction--though designed to have minimal impact on the environment--would impede tidal flows in a harbor that had serious pollution issues at the time. Looking back, Michael Kubo, a codirector of pinkcomma gallery who led the research on the expo project for the BSA exhibit, believes that the project was also caught up in the racial politics of the time, since it would have included affordable housing on the site, and a T line that would connect mostly white South Boston to the nonwhite neighborhoods of Dorchester.             That September, Boston's City Council, whose power bases lay in the city's neighborhoods, voted to oppose the plan. The mayor's office still backed it, and a delegation led by White and Governor Francis W. Sargent traveled to Washington, D.C., to present the proposal formally to the federal commission. But so did an anti-expo contingent, including Hicks, then-State Senator Joe Moakley, and Representative Michael Flaherty of South Boston, to make a counter-presentation and discourage the government from picking Boston. With its host city so publicly divided, the expo proposal was effectively derailed.             In many ways, the demise of the expo plan heralded the end of an era. By the late 1960s, a burgeoning preservation movement had begun to promote the idea that Boston should protect its heritage rather than replace old with new. Neighborhoods were discovering that they could shape planning and even block plans they didn't like.In the early 1970s, for instance, grass-roots pressure helped to kill a planned Southwest Expressway connecting I-95 to South Boston, using the site instead for a new route for the Orange Line and the Southwest Corridor parks and bike path. Public funding for city projects began to dry up, and the idea that the BRA could make big decisions by fiat was gone.                         In many ways,the BRA today still develops plans and exerts control over Boston development, but it serves more as gatekeeper. Its planning director, Kairos Shen, argues that this negotiation process results in better design. ""It's not just about the boldness of the vision; there's also this issue of the quality and appropriateness of the vision,'' he says. ""We have a very different set of values now.''             But when some historians and architects look at those values, they also see a city that has closed itself off to the possibility of big plans for the long-term future--the kind of vision that the expo plan represented., those changes were undoubtedly positive. However promising they sounded at the time, Government Center and the demolition of the West End are now almost universally seen as miscalculations that damaged Boston's historic heart; such moves are now nearly impossible to imagine. Planning takes place through a process of negotiation between developers, community members, and Mayor Menino's City Hall.             ""I think that period offered a leadership that we're lacking now,'' says Mark Pasnik, codirector of pinkcomma and one of the exhibit's organizers. He acknowledges that today's small-bore, case-by-case approach has ""some healthy sides to it,'' but worries that without a larger picture of where the city is going it's not possible to make decisions that might benefit the collective good rather than simply reflecting the interests of affected neighborhoods.             ""Every city needs to have bold strokes in the city as well as individual strokes--I think they're harder to do now,'' says Wampler. ""I suspect Frederic Olmstead would have a terrible time designing the Emerald Necklace now,'' he adds.             Boston is an overwhelmingly healthier city than it was a half a century ago. But it still faces challenges and choices: how to deal with continued gentrification of the city center, how to develop its waterfront more fully, how to balance density with open space, how a coastal city should confront long-term environmental and climate risks. Although the BRA has plans for sections of the city, the last master plan for Boston development is one the agency produced in 1965, and revised in 1975. Shen says such comprehensive plans are too nonspecific and cumbersome, but Pasnik argues that they can be important in getting beyond ""medium scale'' strategies and thinking of the city as a whole.             Is it possible to regain the bold sense of Boston's future without the disasters of the previous era? ""We want communities to have a say, and we want developers to be rewarded,'' says Pasnik. ""I think we need to tip the balance back.''             Some thinkers go even further, and say it's time to acknowledge that effective planning means thinking beyond the city limits. George Thrush, head of Northeastern University's architecture school, has been pushing for a project called the Urban Ring, which would create public spaces that link together long-disconnected areas in Boston, Brook-line, Cambridge, Somerville, Chel-sea, and Everett. But such a plan would require an authority that can cross town lines. ""The notion of regional identity is something that Boston as a modern economic powerhouse has to deal with,'' he says. ""What we really need is a regional development agency.''             The recent Boston Society of Architects exhibition was intended to start the conversation, and Pasnik admits it's one largely fueled by academic thinkers now. But that's part of the process: We won't see the future differently until we can come to terms with the city's past and reexamine it with new eyes.             Keith Morgan, a historian of architecture at Boston University, says that first step is already happening. Younger historians and architects are ""not ac-cepting the standard text that urban re-newal was bad, evil, and everything that happened during that period was terrible,'' he says. ""That's all ridiculous, and entirely too easy a dismissal of a time when Boston completely remade itself.''

Presley died at his Memphis residence, Graceland, in 1977. Mr. Lansky picked out the white suit and blue tie that Presley wore when he was buried. buried. “I put his first suit on him and his last suit on him,” Mr. Unsky was fond of saying. By the early 1950s, Mr. Unsky’s Unsky’s shop was known as a place where a man with a taste for flash could find the styles Mr. Lansky referred to as ‘‘real sharp.” At the time, Beale Street was a hot spot for blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz, and drew a colorful colorful parade of musicians, gamblers, gamblers, and hustlers from the Mississippi Delta. Presley began hanging around Beale Street as a teenager teenager and picked up quickly on its music. One of Mr. Unsky’s favorite Elvis stories was how he first met the future King of Rock ‘n’ Roll. Presley was a teenager working as an usher at a nearby theater and liked to window shop at Unsky?s. ?He said, ‘When I get rich, I’m going to buy you out,’ ” Mr. Lansky said in a standard version version of the story. ‘‘1 said, ‘Don’t buy me out.

The first thing when they get here, they’ve got to come down to Lansky’s,” Mr. Unsky said. Entertainers like B.B. King, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash. ZZ Top, Kiss, and Hootie and the Blowfish also dropped by to shop and visit. Bernard and Guy Lansky parted ways in the 1980s, family family members said. In 1997, the Presley estate opened a nightclub called Elvis Presley’s Memphis at Unsky’s old store on Beale Street. It closed in 2003, and the building building was left unused once again.

Robert Castle; activist priest became movie actor By Margalit Fox NEW YORK TIMES NEW YORK - The Rev. Robert W. Castle Jr., an outspoken outspoken Episcopal priest in Harlem who was the subject of Jonathan Jonathan Demme’s acclaimed 1992 documentary, “Cousin Bobby” — and who went on to a film acting career as a result — died Oct. 27 at his home in Holland, Yt He was 83. The death, of natural causes, was confirmed by his family. Rev. Castle, who really was Demme’s cousin, was the rector of St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, a largely black and Hispanic congregation on West 126th Street, from 1987 until his retirement retirement in 2000. There, he ran an energetic ministry in which spirituality and social action were indissolubly indissolubly linked, relishing his role as ‘‘an obdurate whirligig fulminating fulminating against the establishment,? establishment,? as N.R. Kleinfield wrote in The New York Times in 1996. Demme, the Oscar-winning director of “The Silence of the Lambs” and other feature films, had been out of touch with his cousin for decades. In the late 1980s, he read a new-spaper article article describing Rev. Castle?s practice of plastering irate notices notices on the windshields of cars that were parked illegally on the church sidewalk, blocking congregants’ access.

Campaigning with him took her “from the tree-shaded houses houses of Jamaica Plain to the tenements tenements of Mission Hill,” she wrote in “Lost Boston,? and provided provided an “education of the eyes.” She graduated from what was then the Buckingham School for girls and went to Radcliffe College, from which she graduated magna cum laude in 1960, majoring in American history and writing a thesis on Lewis Mumford, a renowned renowned 20th century cultural critic and urban authority. his long-lost cousin Bobby Castle, Castle, a former star athlete 15 years his senior? ‘‘I thought: ‘Good Lord. I wonder — no, that couldn’t possibly possibly be cousin Bobby,’ ” Demme said on NPR in 1992. “The good Bobby Castle would never be trashing police cars, for heaven’s heaven’s sake.” But he was — and then some. Over his years in the pulpit, pulpit, first at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Jersey City, where he was the rector from 1960 to 1968, and later at St. Mary’s, Rev. Castle fought city hall in all its incarnations. In the 1960s, he marched in Mississippi with the Rev. Martin Martin Luther King Jr. He opened his church, and his home, to meetings of Students for a Democratic Society and the Black Panthers. He picketed banks and restaurants for failing failing to hire minorities. Later, at St. Mary’s, he brought in a priest to say Mass in Spanish. He marched against the Vietnam War, preached against the death penalty, and fought gentrification of the urban neighborhoods he served. In Jersey City, lobbying for cleaner, cleaner, safvr streets, he once dumped vanloads of garbage outside City Hall. In Harlem, to call attention to an unfilled pothole pothole or a much-needed traffic light, he sometimes preached in the middle of the street. Rev. Castle picketed other churches, including the Cathedral Cathedral of St. John the Divine, his neighbor in New York, to protest protest a service there honoring Mr. Duncan crooned, backed by close harmony vocals. Rolling Stone placed it on its list of the 500 greatest songs ever, and films like “Back to the Future? have used it to cottjure an era. “That probably started her down the road of thinking about city planning and art and architecture,? her sister said. Ms. Kay worked as a reporter reporter for the Patriot Ledger in Quincy, married, and had two daughters: Julie, who now lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Jacqueline Jacqueline Cessou, who lives in Paris. After the birth of her daughters, daughters, Ms. Kay worked mostly as a freelance writer and author. Her marriage ended in divorce. “I think everybody who knew Jane knew that she was wonderfully lively and funny and engaging, and at the same time really committed to her work,” her sister said. In the emotional architecture architecture of Ms. Kay’s life, the wall between work and home was thin. “So much of what my mother mother was professionally was what she was personally,” Julie said. That was particularly true with “Asphalt Nation: How the Automobile Took Over America and How We Can Take it Back,” the 1997 book Ms. Kay wrote in the years after she gave up her car. “This is not a proposal for nostalgia,” she wrote in the concluding concluding chapter. “It is a search for creative forward motion to shape the way we transport ourselves and hence live.” In an e-mail, Kenneth T. Jackson, a history professor at Columbia University, said “Asphalt “Asphalt Nation” was “a powerful and persuasive indictment of the car culture that came to General Colin L. Powell and other participants in Operation Desert Storm. In New Jersey, he picketed his own bishop for belonging belonging to segregated clubs. Hepicketed himself, joining ranks with workers seeking a better contract from St. Mary’s Episcopal Center, an AIDS hospice hospice he founded in Harlem. Rev. Castle was arrested so often that, as Demme’s film relates, relates, his children were entirely accustomed to asking, “How much is the bail, Mom?” “He was an angry white man, I’ll tell you,” Demme said by phone Tuesday. ?He really found fault with so many ways that people of color are treated in America; it infuriated him. That said, he was a lot of fun.” Rev. Castle’s crackling onscreen onscreen presence in “Cousin Bobby” led to roles in more than a dozen fiction films. Among them was ?Philadelphia” ?Philadelphia” (1993), directed by Demme, in which he played Bud Beckett, the father of the young lawyer Andrew Beckett, who is dying of AIDS. Andrew Beckett was played by Tom Hanks. While unfazed by civil disobedience disobedience and its consequences, consequences, Rev. Castle quailed at the prospect of kissing Joanne Woodward, who played his wife, Demme later said. His other films for Demme include ?Beloved” (1998) and “Rachel Getting Married” (2008). His films for other directors directors include “The Addiction? (1995), directed by Abel Ferrara, Ferrara, in which Rev.

Quite simply, Jane Holtz Kay called it as she saw it.” As she walked from her home on Marlborough Street to work and nearly every place else, Ms. Kay interacted with the city “in a much more visual and visceral way,? her daughter Julie said. “What she experienced, experienced, and what I learned from her, is that it really is a better lifestyle. You see more and you experience more.” At home, Ms. Kay had a “love of colors and crafts and things around her,” Julie said. “She also always had one or two cats hanging around.” Ms. Kay “had a very strong aesthetic sense,” said Dorothea Hass, who cofounded the pedestrian pedestrian advocacy group WalkBoston WalkBoston and for many years shared office space with Ms. Kay not far from Faneuil Hall. “Her apartment looked lovely. She put herself together in a very artful way in terms of her clothes and so forth.” Haas added that Ms. Kay “was intellectual, eccentric, loyal, loyal, and always very willing to help out. And she was full of fun.” A service has been held for Ms. Kay, who in addition to her sister and two daughters leaves four grandchildren. During her years as a critic and author, writing in an office with others around, Ms. Kay shared her precise editing talents talents and would just as easily give away a sweater she thought looked better on someone someone else. “It was a wonderful time, and I don’t think we appreciated appreciated it at the time, but that’s how life is,” Hass said. “You don’t think that eventually this is going going to end.” Ms. Kay was “very caught up in her identity as a writer,” Hass said, and “really believed she would never retire, that she’d be one of those little old ladies railing against the corporate world, and the tall buildings, and the hardening of the urban landscape.” Bryan Marquard can be reached at b m a r • quard@globe.com. MAURICE C CARROLI./N.Y. TIMES/19«4 ROBERT CASTLE cised his priestly prerogative by performing an exorcism on Lili Tkylor. Robert Wilkinson Castle Jr. was bom in Jersey City, N.J., on Aug. 29, 1929. He earned a bachelor’s degree from St. Lawrence Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., where he was an all-America all-America quarterback, followed by a degree from the Berkeley Divinity Divinity School in New Haven. As a divinity student, he was assigned to work in a black parish parish on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The experience, he later said, helped forge his commitment commitment to civil rights. In the late 1960s, after leaving leaving his pulpit in Jersey City — he had proved enough of a thorn in the diocesan side that no other parish was open to him — he moved with his family family to Vermont, where he ran a general store and did social service service work. pop chart.

530,1240799771,"""Southie Rules"" finally has an airdate. The reality TV show focused on a South Boston family battling the ""relentless gentrification of their neighborhood"" will premiere on A&E Jan. 29, the network announced. ""To yuppies, jumping in the frigid harbor on New Year's Day, housing three generations of a family under one roof, or never moving from the home you were born in may seem ridiculous, but to this family, it's . . . their way of life,"" says a blurb on the network's website. ""These 'Southies' are faithful to their legacy, and they're not budging, unless they kill each other first."" (The network hasn't ID'd the family, but it centers on Leah Lentini Winters, a probation officer, her mom, Camille Niedzwiecki, who lives on the top floor with Leah's dad, Walter, and  Leah's brother, Matty, who lives on the middle floor with Jen, the mother of his child.) Produced by Somerville-based Powderhouse Productions, the show is sure to include a few stereotypes that could rankle some Southie residents. Maureen Dahill, a lifelong resident of South Boston who writes the CaughtinSouthie.com blog, says some folks in the neighborhood are adamant about not watching the show while others plan to tune in ""to watch the trainwreck."" Either way, ""no one is thinking this will be a really great show,"" she says.

But he hopes people will reserve judgment at least until A&E airs the first episode Tuesday. The show, which the network has said is focused on a South Boston family battling the ""relentless gentrification of their neighborhood,"" follows Niedzwiecki's family, living in traditional Southie fashion all together in a triple-decker. ""I think the community is naturally split because of the speculation that this is like 'Jersey Shore,' "" he said, referring to the MTV show with Snooki and JWoww. ""But it's not. We live in this town. We don't vacation in South Boston like it's the Jersey shore, we live here."" (Newcomers to the neighborhood might take issue with the show's intro, which includes someone saying: ""Whoever said change is good isn't from Southie."") Niedzwiecki, who's 28 and the owner of a tattoo parlor in Framingham, credits the show's producer, Somerville-based Powderhouse Productions, for trying to capture the comedic quality of the family, not the crass. (Jon's brother Matt's a bit of a slacker, and his underemployment is a bone of contention.)

145,1974231135,"Metro Kevin Cullen Real-deal candidates i i It’s too bad campaigns aren’t trials, because we could just stipulate that Ed Markcy and Steve Lynch, the two Democrats who want to replace John Kerry in the Senate, arc self-made guys who grew up in neighborhoods neighborhoods where nobody was born on third base. This would save a lot of breath and countless trees. As one of approximately nine people who have lived large chunks of their lives in both Malden and South Boston, I feel somewhat qualified to say that the places where the two congressmen grew up were similar. When they came of age, the richest people people in town tended to be gangsters, doctors, and lawyers. Both places had plenty of public public housing, which was a sign of political influence, not extreme poverty. Being poor, meanwhile, was not seen as a personal failing failing but an accident of birth and a way station. station. There were plenty of examples of neighbors who studied or worked their way up and sometimes out. The biggest difference difference between the two places is that if you moved out, you drove north on 1-93 from Malden and headed south on 1-93 from Southie. North Shore, South Shore. As politicians increasingly need to suck up to millionaires to ran for high office, or be millionaires themselves, it has become de rigueur to emphasize one’s ordinary roots. This is meant to show that, despite the trappings of power and wealth, politicians politicians know what it’s like for voters just trying trying to get by. This often ends up being unintentionally hilarious or sublimely ridiculous. Who can forget the Romneys roughing it on tuna fish or, horror of horrors, horrors, having to sell off some stock to make ends meet in their early years. But Markey and Lynch are the real deal. Lynch was an ironworker like his father. They got laid off on the same day once. Lynch’s mother worked the night shift at the post office so the family could move out of the Old Colony projects. They moved two blocks, to East Eighth Street. Lynch walked across steel beams high above the ground and put himself through law school. Markey’s roots arc equally humble, his parents equally inspirational, his ambition equally admirable. Markey’s father drove a milk truck, and Markcy drove an ice cream track to put himself through Boston College. And that was when BC was a commuter commuter school, long before Doug Mutie threw that pass and Father Monan raised all that money. Lynch says he is not interested in trying to out-Regular Joe his opponent. With one caveat. “Strapping on bools for 18 years and doing a dangerous job, and having to travel all over the country to find work, is not the same thing as driving an ice cream track to put yourself through college,” he said. Markey, for his part, told me he secs a lot of similarities between Malden and Southie, and his and Lynch’s upbringings. “I think,” Markey said, “we come from a very similar place.” Good. That means they can talk about other things. Lynch intends to campaign as a Washington outsider and portray his opponent opponent as a Beltway insider. But Lynch isn’t obsessed with how many days Markey spends in the district. “I’m not taking attendance,? he said. “There are some very effective reps who don’t come back to their districts.” Some of Lynch’s constituents, especially neightvirs on G Street, prefer that he wasn’t in the district as much. “My neighbors wish I was in Washington more so they could take my parking space,? he said. Markey laughs at the thought of reporters reporters trying to figure out how many nights he sleeps in his house on Townsend Street, the house he grew up in. “In 36 years, I’ve been at T.ogan | airport] or | Reagan 1 National about 1,400 limes,?

With the premiere of “Southie Rules” on A?E, the neighborhood?s reality show era had officially begun.

676,1974508097,"It l-A I. K S T A I K NOW Boston is a hot spot for gentrification Highlights from the Boston Real Estate Now blog. The Hub is undergoing the most rapid gentrification of any city in the country, a new study by the Cleveland Fed finds. More than a quarter of all Bostonians now live in formerly low-income neighborhoods neighborhoods that have since been gentrified, gentrified, many over the bubble years of the early and mid-2000s. And that number is likely higher now — the study doesn’t go past 2007, with prices once again back or having blown past previous peaks in a number of neighborhoods. I spotted the item on John Ford’s Boston Real Estate Blog, which offers an interesting take. As Ford’s blog points out, the study offers up a somewhat controversial assessment, seeming to argue that gentrification gentrification isn’t all that bad for longtime neighborhood residents. “A look at the data suggests that gentrification gentrification is actually beneficial to the financial health of the original residents,” residents,” the Cleveland Fed study finds.

Seattle? Just 9 percent. Rising rents costly now and later Not only are rising rents bad for apartment dwellers, it is making the dream of home ownership increasingly unattainable for millions of Americans. That is one of several findings in a new study released by the nonprofit Demand Group, a joint venture of the Conference Board and Nielsen. As many as 31 percent of renters are forking over 30 to 50 percent of their pay on rent. And a quarter find themselves signing over more than half of their paychecks paychecks to their landlords. Yet while large numbers of renters still hope to buy some day, they may wind up finding themselves locked out of the market at a time when housing prices have yet to fully recover in some communities, the report finds. More than 74 percent of those surveyed surveyed argued that home ownership should be “an important long-term goal” while an even higher number, 77 percent, percent, agreed with the statement that housing is “an excellent investment.? Yet nearly half of would-be homeowners homeowners who say they hope to buy in the next five years have not saved enough to make that a reality. “Many still have aspirations beyond their means,” the study notes.

The survey zeroed in on towns with high homeownership rates and a comfortable comfortable fit between home prices and what residents are actually earning. Topping the list was Wilmington, a town of 22,350 of 17 miles north of Boston Boston that hardly ever pops up on anyone’s list. The median home price in Wilmington Wilmington is $378,900. The town boasts a home ownership rate of nearly 90 percent, tops in Massachusetts. Massachusetts. Moreover, median housing costs in Wilmington are $2,228 a month, a relatively affordable 27 percent of median median monthly income ($8,252). The rest of the top five, in order, are: Franklin, ownership rate of just under 80 percent and housing costs just under 30 percent of median income; Reading, ownership rate of 82 percent and housing housing costs just over 30 percent; Burlington, Burlington, ownership rate of over 71 percent and one of the lowest residential taxes in the area; and Hudson, which boasts a relatively affordable median home price of just over $290,000.

A I. l-SIA?l K NOW Boston is a hot spot for gentrification Highlights from the Boston Reed Estate Now blog The Hub is undergoing the most rapid gentrification of any city in the country, a new study by the Cleveland Fed finds. More than a quarter of all Bostonians now live in formerly low-income neighborhoods neighborhoods that have since been gentrified, gentrified, many over the bubble years of the early and mid-2000s. And that number is likely higher now — the study doesn’t go past 2007, with prices once again back or having blown past previous peaks in a number of neighborhoods. I spotted the item on John Ford’s Boston Real Estate Blog, which offers an interesting take. As Ford’s blog points out, the study offers up a somewhat controversial assessment, seeming to argue that gentrification gentrification isn’t all that bad for longtime neighborhood residents. “A look at the data suggests that gentrification gentrification is actually beneficial to the financial health of the original residents,’’ residents,’’ the Cleveland Fed study finds.

In the scene, which was shot in Lynn because the gentrification of the South Boston waterfront has rendered the place virtually unrecognizable, Johnny Depp, who plays Bulger, is seen with a rifle as he stalks past the bodies of Halloran and Donahue.

872,1544931552,"Trains can make neighborhoods, by connecting residents to jobs and enabling an intensity of development that isn't possible in places where residents are handcuffed to their cars. But trains can also break neighborhoods, because gentrification often comes hitched to the back of a rail car. If a city greets new transit with indifference, the most vulnerable residents around a new station don't stand a chance of remaining in their neighborhood.              Boston is facing that dynamic because subway-like rail service will soon come to the Fairmount Line. The city is scrambling to find a way to harness the Fairmount's economic potential without triggering runaway gentrification.              Boston's dance with the Fairmount hinges on a pair of vacant, city-owned industrial properties, which hit the market this summer. They are the first of hundreds of publicly owned development parcels that should be sold, and redeveloped, in a big anti-gentrification effort along the line. But the properties will only really matter if the city, neighborhood residents, and outside developers can all agree to go big enough to make a real difference.              The city owns the old Cote Ford site in Mattapan and the former Maxwell box warehouse in Dorchester. Cote Ford, an old car dealership surrounded by Jersey barriers and cracked asphalt, sprawls on Cummins Highway, just up the street from Blue Hill Avenue and Mattapan Square. The Maxwell property is three acres of derelict industrial buildings north of Uphams Corner in Dorchester. Both sites should be crying out for redevelopment. But both slid into city ownership, and have sat idle, because there haven't been many developers willing to build something of consequence on the outskirts of Uphams Corner or Mattapan Square.             The Fairmount Line, which runs directly behind both sites, changes everything. The line connects Hyde Park, Mattapan, and Dorchester with South Station. It puts neighborhoods that rank among the city's poorest, and that have been saddled with some of the city's worst commutes, a quick ride away from both downtown Boston and the emerging Newmarket industrial hub.              Several refurbished stations opened along the Fairmount Line over the past two years, but the real revolution will come over the next few years, when the MBTA begins replacing existing commuter rail trains with new self-propelled diesel-powered coaches. The new diesel coaches are essentially subway cars that run on commuter rail tracks. And when the Cote Ford and Maxwell sites are suddenly steps away from rapid transit stations, their value, and potential, will soar.              The whole idea behind the Fairmount Line is to bring economic activity to the streets that surround the train tracks. Rising property prices should be an indication that the rail line has created something people want to be a part of. But that's only if the trains are helping to create wealth in neighborhoods instead of just importing it and pushing aside existing residents in the process. And, as research from Northeastern University's Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy has shown, gentrification and displacement tend to follow closely behind transit expansion projects.              More than any other local transit expansion, the Fairmount has the potential to be uniquely gentrification-proof. That's because the city owns an enormous amount of real estate along the line. That real estate will soon be unloaded rapidly. The city hopes to turn 200 small vacant parcels into one-, two-, and three-family homes containing roughly 400 housing units. So even without releasing any sizable parcels, the city can make a big push on affordable homeownership along the Fairmount.              If done right, Cote Ford and Maxwell have the potential to amplify these smaller efforts. They could become large wells of mixed-income housing, perched atop vibrant new storefronts. They should be new hubs of activity, and affordability, at stations that are poised suddenly to become main streets. The city is doing its part by selling the parcels at a time when they can do some good. Now it's up to residents to line up behind projects big enough to blunt the gentrification that the Fairmount Line enables.              Paul McMorrow is an associate editor at Commonwealth Magazine.

CHINI.UND Managing Editor/News Worcester should push ahead in testing police body cameras A PTER THE outcry in Ferguson, Mo. — where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer last month — police departments departments across the country are engaging in some much-needed soul-searching to explore explore ways in which they can serve communities communities better. Requests for police officers to wear video cameras, for example, have intensified intensified after the Brown shooting. An online online petition drive calls for a “Mike Brown Law,” which would require all state, county, and local police to wear them. Indeed, Ferguson Ferguson police announced recently that 50 of its officers are now wearing body cameras, which were donated by two companies that manufacture the devices. And the largest police force in the country, the New York Police Department, soon followed with its own pilot program that will outfit 60 officers officers with cameras. Among the largest law enforcement agencies in Massachusetts, the Worcester Police Department is leading the way as it considers doing the same. It’s not yet clear how cameras will affect police work, but that’s exactly why pilot initiatives initiatives should proceed. Police-worn body cameras have long been controversial due to concerns about the privacy of officers and the public alike, but the availability of video evidence of police interactions with Kill switch law: Phones can take care of themselves A first-of-its-kind law signed in California last week requires all smartphones to have “kill switch” technology enabled, which allows the owner to remotely lock the device in the event of theft. But the law seems excessive and almost completely unnecessary, as those features already exist in most smartphones. I .aw enforcement officials point to kill switch software as the biggest deterrent of smartphone smartphone theft. About a year ago, Apple introduced its own kill switch feature in all iPhones. Because of that, iPhone theft went down 38 percent in San Francisco, with other cities also reporting significant decreases. Microsoft and Google recently committed to introducing a similar kill switch in phones using their operating systems. Apple, Google, and Microsoft dominate the mobile market, as 97 percent of US smartphones are powered by those operating operating systems. In other words, the California law just isn’t needed to ward off theft. It could, however, have some significant unintended consequences. For example, the law states that the kill switch may be activated by the government, raising the possibility that police or other officials could deactivate phones in some scenarios. In general, government government bodies should be wary of micromanaging the tech market. California’s kill switch law is overkill, a piece of consumer protection legislation that doesn’t protect, and could, in some circumstances, do the opposite. TALL SHIPS RETURN IN 2017 No hesitation this time T HE TALL SHIPS are returning, and this time in their full glory. Sail Boston 2017 will be a five-day event in June of that year, and is expected to bring the largest fleet of the historical historical vessels to the city’s waterfront since 2000. This next event, the fleet’s only US stop in 2017, will make even better use of Boston Harbor than in the past. There will be new viewing areas on the Charlestown and East Boston waterfronts. The scope of the 2017 plan marks a major major shift from the last tall ships visit in 2009, which was clipped by political acrimony. Despite the success of the visits in 1992 and 2000, Mayor Menino opposed the 2009 event because the city had been stuck with some expenses. It was only the intervention of Governor Patrick and $1 million in state money to rover security costs that allowed the ships to set sail to Boston. All the same, it was downgraded to a smaller affair, without without fireworks or the popular “Parade of Sail,” which typically draws the most visitors. visitors. Mayor Walsh has a different mindset about the ships and their potential economic economic impact. The 2000 event drew about 7 million people, who spent an estimated $120 million in the city.

A 2012 pilot program program in Rialto, Calif., yielded impressive results: results: Each officer in the city of about 100,000 residents was given a body camera. In the first year after the program started, the use of force by officers declined 60 percent. percent. Citizen complaints fell 88 percent. Worcester police chief Gary Gemme says cost is a big obstacle in his department of 440 officers. The devices cost anywhere between between $300 and $700 each, and then there’s the question of where and for how long to store hours and hours of video. According to a spokesman, the Boston police currently have no plans to fit officers with cameras. The Amherst Police Department has been experimenting with only a few body cameras cameras for its officers. As more and more US police police departments weigh the pros and cons, the Justice Department is expected to release release federal guidelines soon.

600,1664388723,"Development projects in Boston are routinely subjected to a withering barrage of criticism from community groups and neighbors, but, even by Hub standards, redeveloping the site of the Gate of Heaven school in South Boston has been difficult. Regardless, the decision to build condos on the parcel is the right one -- even if some wrinkles in the process by which the city negotiated with the community need to be ironed out.              Dorchester developer Oranmore Enterprises LLC's plan for the Gate of Heaven site on East Fourth Street, confirmed by the Boston Redevelopment Authority last week, is relatively modest, calling for 26 units and 40 parking spots. But it still provoked furious opposition from neighbors, who see the development as a symbol of the gentrification of the neighborhood. An informal door-to-door poll conducted for Mayor Martin Walsh last year found that 85 percent of neighbors disapproved of Oranmore's plan. In the face of that opposition, Walsh placed the project on an eight-month ""cooling off"" period to give the neighborhood association a chance to find a new tenant. When they weren't able to, the mayor allowed the project to proceed.             Putting the project on hiatus and then ultimately allowing it to move ahead were smart moves by the mayor. Allowing neighbors a chance to find another use for the parcel signaled to them that City Hall is serious about moving away from the top-down development style of Mayor Tom Menino -- an especially contentious issue in South Boston, which is seeing faster redevelopment than perhaps any other neighborhood in the city. But Walsh was also right to insist that something be done with the site. Gate of Heaven is in the middle of a residential district and just a short walk away from East Broadway, which is quickly turning into one of the city's most vibrant main streets. Allowing a major parcel to fester -- the site has begun to attract vandals and drug dealers -- would only drag down the community.             The cooling off period might also have given residents a chance to come around to the project. ""We didn't want to see it sit idle any longer -- it's an accident waiting to happen,"" says Joe Casper, a fire captain who lives near the site. Casper also said that the neighborhood isn't nearly as united in opposition to the project as the informal poll made it seem.              But opponents remain concerned, in part because of the way the process unfolded. Kevin Lally, the president of the Gate of Heaven Neighborhood Association, has accused Walsh of being disingenuous during the negotiations, saying that the mayor had assured the association that the condo project was dead. Community groups need to feel that they can take both the mayor and the BRA at face value, and Walsh shouldn't be doing anything that jeopardizes the goodwill he has been able to foster with neighborhood groups. That said, the fracas around the Gate of Heaven site is coming to the right conclusion for South Boston.",3/19/2015,"('symbol', 'of', 'the')","('the', 'neighborhood', 'an')","[' But it still provoked furious opposition from neighbors, who see the development as a symbol of the gentrification of the neighborhood.']", But it still provoked furious opposition from neighbors who see the development as a symbol of the gentrification of the neighborhood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
314,1693497365,"For Bostonians, the recent Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage arrived with a wave of jubilation -- and a splash of deja vu. A week later, the whole thing still seems kind of surreal.             So long has the slog toward equal rights been that many LGBT folks like myself have, over the decades, cultivated something resembling comfort on the margins. What we couldn't bring to the surface, we took underground. We found our own places and made them livable. We spoke our own language, forged our own rules of engagement, and queered exclusion into something exclusive.              This we called gay culture. And for some folks ""in the life,"" as they'd once say, marriage equality (i.e., what happens when ""gay marriage"" becomes just ""marriage"") spells the bittersweet beginning of the end.              One recent New York Times piece points to a ""twinge of loss for an outside culture"" in its headline, laments the loss of gay-specific spaces (""sanctuaries,"" ""retreats""), and goes on to quote Lisa Kron, who wrote the book and lyrics for the musical ""Fun Home,"" who mourns ""the specialness of being gay."" My own Facebook feed was also liberally peppered with acquaintances acknowledging the ""victory"" with a set of scare quotes, as though it were more of a surrender than a coup. These are familiar grumblings.              Ten years before the Supreme Court ruling, and just one year after marriage equality arrived in Massachusetts, Andrew Sullivan famously lamented ""The End of Gay Culture"" (or, more specifically, the gentrification of Provincetown) in The New Republic, bemoaning the erosion of ""distinctive gayness"" in the wake of a fresh wave of acceptance. He borrowed a metaphor from philosopher Michael Walzer to suggest that gays had ""gilded a cage of exclusion with magnificent ornament"" for themselves, and that ""the thing that kept gay people together, that unified them into one homogeneous unit, and that defined the parameters of their culture and the limits of their dreams, were the bars on that cage.""             But the supposed collapse of gay culture hasn't strictly been the byproduct of mainstream acceptance. Gay life has spent decades making a migration to the virtual realm.             When I moved to Boston in the early '90s, the literal bars that formed Sullivan's figurative cage were all shutting down in rapid succession: I watched the 119, the Napoleon Club, Chaps, Buddies, Sporters, Playland (eek), and Quest all board themselves up within a few years of my ID turning valid. The once cruisy aisles of such bookstores as Glad Day and We Think the World of You were all but empty (and Amazon was still a year or two away).              Even before the squealing modems of the Internet started arriving in higher-end households, gay life was shifting toward the intangible. I ""met"" my first boyfriend on an anonymous chat line, where I'd cycle through short-lived connections with disembodied strangers until I heard a deep enough voice (an early ancestor of the Tinder swipe). Meanwhile, the weekly ""alternative lifestyle"" personals in the Boston Phoenix read like a map of desire's boundaries, or a census of a lost population. Sometimes I'd call up the voicemail boxes just to hear what the rest of us sounded like.             And once the Internet did land, it brought with it the bulletin boards and newsgroups, the chat rooms and LiveJournal accounts, the dating sites and choppy ICUII video chats, the social media networks, Grindrs, Growlrs, Tumblrs, and endless other platforms for LGBT folks to connect. At no time in our history has it ever been easier for gay people to find, support, and organize one another. Far from dissolving or diluting gay culture, the Internet has done nothing but expand, empower, and enhance it on almost every front: It's more open and accessible, more galvanized and diverse, more subculturally rich and more culturally present than ever before.              This virtual visibility doesn't just serve LGBT folks as a minority struggling to be seen, but as a community that could benefit from a clearer view of itself.              Marriage equality isn't a cultural finish line; it's more like the starting blocks. In too many states, being gay or transgender can get you fired or evicted; in too many countries it can get you imprisoned or killed. Getting gauzy over our diminishing ""specialness"" while members of our community (especially trans women of color) are still routinely beaten for it is gallingly shortsighted. Romanticizing oppression through a lens of chic nostalgia feels cheap and tacky, and assuming that our precious ""edge"" -- sharpened over decades pressed against an unforgiving grindstone -- will go dull simply because we've secured some basic entitlements is numbingly naive. (We may be equal, but we're still outnumbered.)             Gay culture hasn't withered due to marriage or waned because of the Internet; if anything, it's grown and developed into something that can't be tidily contained or neatly described. Despite the 26 million Facebook users who rainbow-tinted their profile pics in celebration this past week, you'd be hard pressed to find a gay among them who would reduce the LGBT population to Sullivan's imagined ""one homogenizing unit.""              The fact is we've always been too big and too various for the space we've been given. The Internet just grants us enough room to fully realize it. In the dark bars of the good old days, we forged new societies from our sameness, but online and out in the open, our real power awaits in the full spectrum of our difference. It's possible we don't yet know our own strength.             Michael Andor Brodeur can be reached at mbrodeur@globe.com.

1404,1974660897,"Inbox Living in the shadow of a building boom Value of one’s view should not be measured from a rarefied height RE “ THEY took my sky’ ” (Page Al, Jan. 10): While in graduate graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, 1 participated participated in a study to evaluate the importance of views to people living in Berkeley. We selected two study areas: one atop Grizzly Grizzly Peak Boulevard, where homes provided sweeping views of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge, and one in the Berkeley Flats, a neighborhood of small bungalows between the hills and the bay. We interviewed residents in each area about their views. Those living on Grizzly Peak all described their view as the bridge and the skyline. Those living in the Flats provided a much wider list: the stars through a skylight, a postage stamp garden, neighborhood kids playing outside. The richness with which residents of the Flats experienced their surroundings, and how this translated into more awareness awareness of and appreciation for their neighborhood, captivated us. These people valued their views, whether grand or ordinary, ordinary, while many of those in the hills took their views for granted. We concluded that the visual surroundings of those without the pricey views may actually play a more important role in residents’ happiness and community engagement than those of people who can pay for a “view.” We cannot undervalue the importance of the appreciated visual urban landscapes identified by those quoted in Beth Teitell’s article. These views help make Boston’s neighborhoods neighborhoods work. SUSAN JONES MOSES Hudson As they build their towers, developers indifferent to plight of abutters 1 FELT as if Beth Teitell’s report on Boston’s building boom, though well-intentioned, made it sound as if abutters to highrise highrise developments were unreasonable NIMBYs whining when they feel dispossessed of light, air, and sight lines — in other words, those things that give them a sense of connection with nature and the rest of the urban landscape (“ ‘’Hiey took my sky* ”). In fact, developers participating in the gentrification of neighborhoods are not unaware of the consequences of overbuilding overbuilding and density. They are not ignorant. They are indifferent indifferent and arrogant in their dismissal of legitimate reservations. And they are abetted by city officials who look the other way on variances and permitting. None of this bodes well for the sustainability of Boston’s storied neighborhoods, which make our city such a livable place. THOMAS F.

D emocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is either a hopeless throwback to the 1960s or way ahead of his time. The same was true when he was mayor of Vermont’s largest largest city. The self-proclaimed socialist ran Burlington from 1981 to 1989; his intellectual heirs in the local Progressive movement were in charge for most of the next quarter century. Long before today’s millennial voters ever started “feeling the Bern,” Sanders and his corps of idealistic aides were transforming a then-fading city via the unapologetic application of government power. That approach synchs with his stances on national issues. But it also highlights a question that supporters of activist government face on issues big and small: When there’s a wrong to be righted or a market failure to be fixed, how hard should the public sector push? At least in some cases, the Sanders Sanders era in Burlington suggests, the answer is: Don’t be timid. Today’s Burlington, a city of about 42,000, lacks certain key features on 21st-century urban planners’ standard standard wish list: It’s low-slung; it’s carcentric; carcentric; especially on a cold January day, its sloping downtown would be livelier with more density. Yet the storefronts are filled, and the Church Street pedestrian mall in the heart of town still bustles. An old strip of mill buildings to the south abounds with incubators and art spaces. Because the city opened its arms to refugees and other immigrants, North Street — the main drag through a traditional workingclass workingclass area — has taken on an international flavor. A twoblock twoblock stretch boasts the Himalayan Food Market, the Nepali Nepali Dumpling House, and a halal food store with a sign evoking the Somali flag. The so-called Sanderistas were prescient in important ways. Renewable energy and locally sourced food, once mere hippie fixations, have become mainstream priorities in the age of global warming. Economic inequality, Sanders’ Sanders’ marquee issue then and now, has emerged as a matter of overriding national concern. In his presidential bid, Sanders goes big. His plan for debt-free college isn’t subtle; he wants the federal government government to plow money into state universities so they can slash tuition. His response to the withering of private pensions pensions isn’t to nudge Americans to save more; he wants to expand Social Security. Similarly, as mayor, Sanders wasn’t one for modest tweaks. Under Sanders, Burlington promoted below-market-rate below-market-rate housing by creating community land trusts that gained ownership of property and guaranteed that the privately-owned privately-owned homes built on top of it would be permanently permanently price-restricted. ?Ute Sanderistas asserted the public’s public’s right to the Lake Champlain waterfront and oversaw a transition from industrial to recreational uses. The powerful powerful Community and Economic Development Office, or CEDO, that Sanders established in 1983 helped launch neighborhood business associations, an energy investment investment corporation, and more. More fundamentally, Sanders and his team worked to reshape the local economy. They promoted locally owned businesses and employee-ownership corporate structures. After a downtown supermarket moved out, the city spent 17 years — well past the end of Sanders’ tenure — trying Bernie Sanders in Burlington City Hall in 1981, six months after he was elected mayor. ASSOCIATED PRESS to cultivate a replacement. “Some people said, ‘Why is the city developing a supermarket supermarket downtown? It’s not their responsibility. I^ave it to capitalism,’ ” recalls Bruce Seifer, who worked for decades in economic development at CEDO and took me on a driving driving tour of the office’s greatest hits. When city governments get deeply entangled in the details details of projects, the theoretical potential for favoritism or bureaucratic overreach is significant — especially if Sanders-era. Sanders-era. idealism peters out and an agency like CEDO falls under the sway of sullen political insiders. And while CEDO has excelled at stitching together outside grants to fund its initiatives, other government-led projects can exnation’s exnation’s first municipally funded community land trust,” according to Sanders. It forthrightly committed community community resources to community needs, and has produced hundreds of below-market-rate homes in Burlington. Meanwhile, in 1990, the year after Sanders left office, the city enacted an inclusionary zoning ordinance that required required multiunit housing developments to set aside a certain certain percentage of below-market units. In theory, this is a more hands-off approach than creating and funding a community housing trust. But the law is so stringent, argues argues developer Erik Hoekstra, that suburbs without such requirements are building more new multifamily housing than Burlington is. (In contrast, he lavishly praises the housing trust’s work.) When Sanders came to the Globe for an interview late last year, I asked him what a 21st-century urban policy should look like. In the ’80s, cities were hemorrhaging residents and capital; today, progressives in Boston and San Francisco fret over the onslaught of rich people. Sanders wasn’t buying the idea that the underlying issues issues had changed. “Let us talk about for a moment what so many people do not talk about,” he said. “We’ve got 47 million people living in poverty.? He went on to appeal for better child care, more affordable housing, and job creation creation through infrastructure repair. His call for common action on demonstrated community community needs doesn’t surprise longtime acolytes. “He talked about it when he first became mayor,” Seifer says. “He talks about it now.

In Burlington, the most recent Progressive Progressive mayor. Bob Kiss, decided not to run for reelection in 2011 after officials officials quietly sought to cover a shortfall shortfall at the municipally owned telecom company with $17 million in city money. Overall, though, it’s fair to say Sanders-era interventionism tided Burlington over, through an era of suburbanization and shopping mall construction, until the free market once again came to appreciate shops, restaurants, bars, and residences downtown. Plus, some of Sanders’ more overtly overtly socialistic policies have paid off in ways that superficially more moderate moderate efforts have not.

179,1771063821,"Flip through the channels (if you're the kind of person who still does that) and you may find yourself wandering into an unfamiliar neighborhood, somewhere between Animal Planet and the safety of your ""Fixer Upper"" marathon. First thing you notice: Everyone is stoned, even the toddlers, who run in ecstatic slow motion across verdant lawns. Down the street, gangster rappers and Japanese transvestites bump up against crooning Pentecostal preachers and salty sea-captains. And everywhere you look, there are beards. There are so many beards.   Bienvenue a Viceland! Vice -- once just a bratty little Montreal-based alt-weekly, today a massive multimillion-dollar multimedia empire (and now with 5 percent more Disney!) -- has launched its very own TV channel, a little blast of Brooklyn in the deep end of basic cable.  Thus began the gentrification of cable.   While your requisite mixed feelings triggered by the G-word come to a simmer, some background: Through the mid-to-late '90s, Vice was the second most popular paper product in middle-class collegiate skatepunk bathrooms across North America. For those of a certain attitude within a certain subset of a certain generation, Vice served as both almanac of taste and bible of cynicism. It came across a lot like your friends at the time: eagerly into things and effortlessly over them, a little drug hungry and a lot rude, but oddly endearing all the same. And its savage, candid takedowns of wannabe fashionistas in the wild of Brooklyn became its most popular party trick (they still do them). As such, they also became stubbornly emblematic of Vice's chronically misdirected energy.   These days, the Vice brand is all grown-up (valued at ohhh around $2.5 billion) and a little more complicated. It owns a whole block of Web properties (Motherboard, Munchies, Noisey, and Broadly among them) and publishes city guides for the self-conscious traveler; it's got an eponymous documentary series and a forthcoming daily newscast on HBO; and with Viceland, it's now got an A&E-partnered network that will be left largely in the hands of visionary director Spike Jonze.  Suddenly, there's a place on TV where Ellen Page visits Japan with her (bearded) BFF to meet a man who hires friends through an agency so he won't be alone when he comes out to his mother (""Gaycation""); where reliably baked (bearded) rapper and erstwhile chef Action Bronson sucks down malts and blunts and swoons over platters of grilled meat (""[Expletive] That's Delicious""); where (bearded) host Krishna Andavolu doses himself with powerful THC oil to experience a 10th of the high of a toddler taking cannabis to fight cancer (""Weediquette""); and where Compton opens its doors (one in the back of a barbershop) to reveal the thriving hip-hop ecosystem that launched Kendrick Lamar (""Noisey"").   There are shows exploring the circuit of hovels holding the underground stand-up scene together (""Flophouse""), travelogues that check into Provincetown Bear Week (""Balls Deep""), and extended tributes to Werner Herzog. (Beards, beards, beards!)  That is, Viceland is actually quite good -- really good, considering the iffy location. Many of Viceland's shows are direct extensions of its many Web series. Those soft-focus cinematics so common to web video feel fancier on the bigger screen. The woozy, gauzy feel of ""Weediquette,"" for instance, doesn't just make the show feel stoned, it puts you on the level of its subjects, softening the blow dealt by its often brutal storytelling.  Even coming from an unknowably huge yet somehow still alt-media monolith, there's something kind of charming and disarming about an old-timey brick-and-mortar cable TV storefront. Of course, that may be part of the point.   On one hand, Viceland feels like an investment in a dead end -- a benevolent expression of market optimism: corporations being people being cool!   On the other, it feels kind of like a Starbucks or an Apple Store -- a telltale sign that cable's sleepy storefronts will soon just be remodeled as outlets for the online catalogs of whatever massive corporations snap them up.   An hour spent watching Vice is like an hour passed at a Gap: At all times, you are aware you are at the Gap. Everything is white space and black Helvetica, and the untested airtime is so heavy with house ads, they take winking jabs at themselves: ""(BLACK LOGO ON WHITE BACKGROUND),"" reads one. Gauzy teases for Viceland shows are interspersed with surveillance-style clips of the Vice newsroom -- a kind of veal pen of bored bloggers, tweeting hard and hardly working. Vice, you are reminded over and over, is a thing.   Whether the boutique feel of Viceland (somewhere between precious and too cool for cable) ultimately proves to be a selling point or a turnoff, we have yet to see. For now, Viceland makes for an intriguing case study of what happens when the Internet starts playing fixer-upper with old media. If the goal of Viceland is to make the network feel like a hermetically sealed, immersive experience of the brand (that might be the Disney talking), it's working. When, once or twice an hour, an ad for Bosley hair replacement barges in, it feels like an embarrassing breach of vibe -- like a drunk storming into his old haunt, only to find it's a Starbucks.

3,1811958975,"MYSTIC -- This one-time shipbuilding center has had a long tradition of giving people a reason to visit, long past the heyday -- first the Seaport, a kind of maritime Sturbridge Village, then the world-class aquarium, with its celebrity beluga whales. A Cheers-like parlor called Mystic Pizza provided an extra boost, inspiring the 1988 film starring Julia Roberts.  Now comes the white-hot power of the team behind the Ocean House in Watch Hill, R.I., to add a dimension of luxury to a place that still has a functioning Howard Johnson's. With Spicer Mansion, a restored 1853 estate of a sea captain, Mystic is taking things decidedly upscale.  Conjuring a Gilded Age vibe -- the one before the turn of the 20th century -- the boutique hotel is up on a hill overlooking downtown and the Mystic River, offering eight high thread-count, impeccably appointed guestrooms, each named for a vessel in Elihu Spicer's fleet.  Captain Spicer is described as a ""master entertainer,"" suggesting he liked to party. He built the big house for his family to escape the hot summer in New York City, but welcomed family and friends, often putting out pineapples, a symbol of hospitality, to make his guests feel welcome. The place fell on hard times after World War II, getting divided up into apartments, before the Gates family of Stonington, Conn., stepped in to purchase the property.  The restoration salvaged many of the mansion's original architectural details, including intricate parquet floors, plaster moldings, hand-painted ceilings, carved mahogany doors and balustrades, and a view-rich widow's walk. The interior design, a collaboration with the Ocean House Design Group, blends original marine art, the classic feel of Victorian interiors, and contemporary furniture design. Pewter, blue, and gray tones are both regal and soothing.  With the building refurbished, Daniel A. Hostettler and Ocean House Management LLC -- the folks who run the wildly successful Ocean House, Weekapaug Inn and Watch Hill Inn -- pumped in the luxury programming. Guests know they are going to be pampered from the moment they check in. All the rooms are equipped with iPads, Molton Brown toiletries (including the nicest disposable razor I've ever seen), knotted rope paperweights and fresh flowers; the turn-down service includes coiling laptop and phone charger cords in a gray Velcro strap. Somehow that just makes one's life seem so tidy and organized.  Chess, backgammon, and coffee-table books await in the sitting rooms, where guests enjoy handcrafted cocktails and canapes before being escorted to dinner. The daily six-course farm- and sea-to-table culinary experience, choreographed by chef Jennifer Backman, is clearly the main event of any stay here. Our degustation included lobster ravioli and sea foam, Narangensett Bay sea bass, Hopkins Farm lamb, scrumptious desserts -- and six different kinds of foraged sea salt -- all expertly paired with a wines by the glass. Couples sit side-by-each on white quilted banquettes, as the food and drink is lovingly explicated. The printed menu is customized to display the names of the dining guests.  At breakfast, a simple repast served with Dave's coffee from Charlestown, R.I., it's time to plot the day, and the hotel staff is eager to facilitate, with what Spicer Mansion calls ""bespoke moments,"" (spicermansion.com/experiences/bespoke-moments) like a nicely curated picnic in an elegant basket; our treat was to get driven to the Seaport for the Wooden Boat Show in the BMW 7-series sedan, which is made available to guests to drive themselves. (Earlier in the morning we took it out to Noank, and noticed among the many high-tech features was a speedometer appearing hologram-like right at the windscreen, moderating the temptation to punch it).  Other coming attractions include a spacious outdoor deck and The Speakeasy, a subterranean cigar and martini bar behind a bookshelf that opens up to a secret passage.  Spicer Mansion is perfect for a romantic weekend getaway. Frazzled couples have no choice but to leave the kids with their grandparents; only guests over the age of 16 are welcome. Oh well, sorry -- rules are rules!  Polishing gems in the rough has been a forte of investor Charles M. Royce, who transformed Ocean House and is helping redevelop post-industrial downtown Westerly, R.I.; though he is not directly involved in Spicer Mansion, the foray into the easternmost part of Connecticut seems a natural next step for the Ocean House empire. Indeed, there seem to be several canaries in this coal mine. The gentrification of Mystic is marked by the eateries Red 36 (red36ct.com/), the M/Bar (www.mbarct.com/) and Oyster Club (www.oysterclubct.com/). The wait is about to get a lot shorter at the Sea Swirl, let alone the Steak Loft.   And if Mystic starts to feel the least bit finite, the good news is, guests of Spicer Mansion have privileges at the Ocean House and Weekapaug Inn. Take a drive right down Route 1 past Stonington Borough and take a right at downtown Westerly for Watch Hill, and before you know it you'll be at the mother-ship property's gorgeous white sand beach. Just make sure to be back in time for cocktails in Captain Spicer's parlors.

1405,1974693208,"TV CRITIC S CORNER BY MATTHEW GILBERT Debates between William F. Buckley Jr. (leftl and Gore Vidal are explored in the documentary ?Best of Enemies.” Best of Enemies 9 p.m., WGBH 2 Back in the summer of 1968. with the presidential election coming, ratings-starved ABC set up debates between William F. Buckley Jr. and Gore Vidal. The former was a prominent figure in the conservative movement, the latter was a leftist. Both were articulate articulate and fierce. The debates, during the Republican convention in Miami and then three weeks later during the Democratic convention in Chicago. Chicago. turned into shouting matches, and personal attacks were part of the anununition. Vidal called Buckley a “crypto-Nazi.” Buckley called Vidal a ?queer.” each with their antique aristocratic accents at the forefront. At points the debate threatened to get physical. “Now listen, you queer.” Buckley said, “stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I?ll sock you in the goddamn face and you?ll stay plastered. - Monday’s “Independent Lens” series features a look back at those debates with the documentary “Best of Enemies.” directed by Morgan Neville and Robert Gordon. The debates were what we now call “great TV” because the ugliness ugliness was so compelling. They weren?t just theater: they were spectacle. spectacle. Watching two brilliant adults resort to name-calling? Ratings Ratings city. There?s a reason reality shows now work to create conflict among the players. We like to watch. Those debates were harbingers of what is now. alas, fairly common common in political dialogue on TV — uncivil confnmtations between pundits and even, at this particular point, between the candidates themselves. Shouty conflict isn?t an exception these days: it is w hat drives coverage. One step forward, two steps backward.

Q. 1 was sexually assaulted by a man at a party when I was 17. I didn?t report the assault because of the circumstances (underage drinking, etc.). I am now 23. and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart. at a local restaurant, and he recently came through the drive-thru at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it?s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn?t eat at me every time I see him. My question for you is — should 1 confront him? If so. what do I say? If not. what do I do about running into him? STUCK AT 17 A. I can?t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do w hat is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a Tost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. .And although although you say you are “fine.” I don?t think you are fine. I think you?re unsure, hurting, and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson spokesperson at the Rape. Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN.org). the nation?s largest anti-sexual anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. Y?ou can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (+673): they can listen listen to your story, review your options now, and jlso connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN has an online “chat” feature available. 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened. Q. My son recently got married, and although I hosted a nice reception dinner and w as appropriately appropriately dressed for the w edding. I was not invited to participate in any of the wedding photos. Not a single one. I was herded away to the reception room with the rest of the guests and it was only afterward afterward that I realized the photos had been taken without me. My son claims he was so nervous he never noticed I wasn?t there. My new daughter-in-law seems indifferent about the whole thing and acts like I am making making a big deal out of nothing. Recently they delivered a big fat wedding album to my house full of photos of the bride, groom, and all of her parents and family, which I politely declined to accept. I had not met the bride?s family prior to the w edding, but this just seems an incredibly cruel thing to do to me. Am 1 wrong? MOTHER OF THE GROOM A. Whether your son and his wife were deliberately deliberately exclusionary, or merely incredibly thoughtless w hen it came to photos, your reaction reaction — to feel hurt and angry — is completely completely justified. They ow e you a sincere apology. I assume if you received one. you w ould accept it and do your best to move on. Your son’s explanation is almost — but not quite — believable. This is also a rough way for your daughter-in-law to kick off a relationship with her new mother-in-law. After outright refusing refusing to receive this album (an understandable. understandable. but not really generous reaction), a gentle gentle conversation where you honestly describe your feelings is called for. I hope they find a way to flip this script. 0. “Protective Daughter? described her concern concern over her mother?s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. cancer.

Meanwhile, species such as black sea bass, longfin inshore squid, and summer flounder, once rare this far north, have arrived in abundance. Commercial and recreational fishermen alike say that more and more often they see tropical oddities. In 2013, an amateur angler cast a line into the Cape Cod Canal and reeled in a sailfish. The unmistakable smell of food hot from the fryer greets you in the parking lot. Picnic tables, pump dispensers unleashing slicks of ketchup and tartar sauce, a line to order stretching out onto the gravel: This is the familiar summer afternoon scene at Cobies clam shack, right on the Cape Cod Rail Trail in Brewster. But it could be almost anywhere on the Cape.  A late lunch here is one of the purest joys of a summer day off, and a rite of vacationers. Built and popularized around the notion that the nearby sea's bounty was best enjoyed fresh, places like Cobies still make an effort to keep things local when they can, seeking nearby fresh seafood at a price customers will tolerate. But that is increasingly impossible. At clam shacks all over the Cape, the clams come in buckets from Maryland or even all the way from Washington state. If the fish-and-chips fillet is cod or haddock, it could have come from as far north as Canada. And depending on the season, a lot of the lobster consumed on the Cape has made its way down from Maine.  That familiar menu is almost an anachronism now, and the fishing fleet that once caught it is changing and shrinking.  One of the dwindling number of commercial fishermen who remain, Eric Hesse, was out on the water in Wychmere Harbor one recent day, troubleshooting a balky autopilot on one of his fishing boats, the Tenacious II.  Long ago, when this perfect circle of seawater in Harwich Port, on the Cape's southern coast, was called Salt Pond, people held horse races around it. When a channel was finally cut and dredged through to Nantucket Sound in 1887, commercial fishing began to take hold.  Today, the working fish pier is flanked by sprawling manses packed in like herring, their dark green lawns mowed into patterns of diamonds or stripes.  Thirty-five years ago, Hesse would have had an expert nearby to diagnose and repair a problem with the ship's hydraulics. Now, many in those specialty trades have moved off the Cape or into new careers, just like so many of the fishermen Hesse knew. Hesse, like the other captains, used to spend winters reeling in great hauls of cod. Hundreds of years ago, the fish were so abundant that fishermen told tall tales of walking across the Atlantic on their backs. But their populations were pummeled by overfishing. By the time regulators strictly limited cod fishing, climate change had made recovery much harder. The water around the Cape — already at the southern limit of the cod's range — was getting warmer. Particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and oxygen levels in their early lives, the cod have been slow to rebound.  With the fish went the fishermen.  “There's just a handful of commercial guys left — people that actually fish for their whole living, Hesse said. Fishing was less a job than a lifestyle then, passed between generations like an inheritance. But Hesse's two sons are in their early 20s, and one is working for a big software company, the other is in school, pre-med. Hesse keeps at it, though now he fishes for haddock and harpoons tuna. He fills in some of the gaps in both time and income working with scientific research organizations studying sharks, or deploying gear for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution researchers monitoring climate change. Many other former fishermen have ended up in trades serving another industry, one that's thriving on the Cape — construction of houses. Few fishermen, if any, would suggest climate change alone upended their livelihood. But warming seas and resultant change in fish populations have undeniably changed the course of the Cape's fleets, not always in expected ways. Jared Bennett, a 29-year-old Chatham fisherman, is as rare as a blue lobster on the Cape: a young commercial fisherman on his own boat, at the start of what he hopes will be a long career. Bennett is bringing in big catches of something that Cape fishermen once tossed back in disgust: a species of small shark called spiny dogfish. Dogfish, common around the world, have always lived near the Cape. But, uncommonly resilient and adaptable to changes in their habitat, their populations have soared in recent years. Swimming in aggressive packs of thousands, they're a bane of haddock fishermen like Hesse. Leave your long lines in too long, and you'll haul up the lips and skeletal remains of hooked haddock ravaged by dogfish. Dogfish fetch a fraction of the price that more prized fish would bring — paying fisherman something closer to 20 cents a pound than $2 or more for cod. But at Chatham's famous fish pier, commercial boats returning from sea now line up with huge catches. Last month alone, Massachusetts fisherman landed over a million pounds of dogfish.  Cape fishing marketers have tried to sell restaurants and a skeptical public on the unfamiliar and unfortunately named species that people devour overseas. One effort included a possible rebranding — a new name to appeal to consumers, perhaps especially visitors to these shores: Cape shark. “They're here, Bennett said," matter-of-factly. “So we're going to catch them."""" There is one oceanic delicacy that you can be sure emerged from local waters: raw oysters. A dozen Wellfleets is still a dozen Wellfleets. But if you've ordered a dozen raw oysters on the Cape in recent years", it's quite likely that they were hatched and nursed in a low-slung cluster of buildings and tidal pools at the end of a dirt road on the shore in Dennis.  For about 50 years, this has been the home of the Aquacultural Research Corporation's hatchery. Digging a pail full of quahogs from the shallows might feel like unearthing nature's bounty, but these days it's a near certainty that those clams, too, came from A.R.C. Towns purchase them from the organization in mesh bags and seed the sand with shells not much bigger than a pea.  A.R.C. is critical to the present and future of the shellfish industry here. It supplies about 80 percent of the seed for clam and oyster farmers on the Cape. But the steady flow of briny bivalves emerging from the facility behind Chapin Beach belies the reality for this vulnerable species.  In the wild, “shellfish populations are at 1 percent of historic levels along Cape Cod, said Rob Doane, the former chief executive of A.R.C. who left the company this month.  “Commercial fishing boats used to be able to steam out for half an hour and get a full boat of wild quahogs. Now it's to the point that it's not even economical to go out and try to find them, said Rick Sawyer, A.R.C.'s president. Some of their disappearance is due to overfishing, but because of the changing climate, native shellfish cannot replenish themselves.  “Once they're gone, they're gone, Doane said," “no different than what we've done to the cod or the lobster.""""  Warmer water", shifting seasons, dangerous algae blooms caused by storm runoff: All pose serious risks to shellfish, even here. On rare occasions, problems in water quality can slip past A.R.C.'s testing. In March, an algae bloom clogged filters, resulting in the death of 20 to 30 percent of an oyster spawn.   One morning in early June, A.R.C.'s staff went to their farm in Barnstable to retrieve 200,000 quahogs about as big around as a dime, ready to sell as seed to another farm. But more than two-thirds were gone, likely the result of changing seasonal patterns.  “When a quahog goes dormant, it's set for the winter. But what we've been seeing the last few winters is that it will go dormant, and then we'll get a spike in temperature and they'll wake up, Doane said. Once they awaken in water that isn't warm enough to support the algae they eat, the clams can't sustain themselves. Their tiny shells open and drift away.  “In the fall, they were beautiful, healthy quahogs, Doane said. “Three or four months later," here we are."""" That makes the future of the shellfish industry a little murky on Cape Cod", where Dave Fontaine and the other shuckers at the Beachcomber in Wellfleet will bang through 1,200 or so oysters a day.  For now, Doane said, most of the oysters on raw bars on the Cape are local; shellfish destined for the fryer are usually trucked in from the Chesapeake Bay.  When A.R.C. was founded 60 years ago, aquaculture was envisioned as a way to create cheap protein to help solve world hunger.  Today, Massachusetts shellfish — what's left of them — are too valuable to shuck and fry. Fortify and retreat On a summer afternoon, vacationers fill the parking lot nestled between the dunes at Chapin Beach in Dennis. They unload beach chairs and plunge umbrellas into powdery sand, their children splashing across acres of bayside shallows and sandbars exposed by low tide.  Unless they've seen what winter brings, they would not realize that the road they traveled to get here was so close to ruin. The only clues along Dr. Bottero Road are a handful of highway-orange construction barrels and a web of cracks in the asphalt — remnants of winter storms that erode the earth right out from under the roadway, the blacktop cracking and collapsing.  “It just sticks right out there and says, 'Erode me. Hit me with your waves,' said Karen Johnson, natural resources director for the town of Dennis. “We go into every winter saying," 'Is Dr. Bottero going to make it?""""' Often", it doesn't. Over the course of Johnson's nine years on the job, Chapin Beach has lost about 30 feet to erosion.  There are places like this all over the Cape — homes, streets, whole neighborhoods — that exist perilously close to catastrophe. And in every town, there are people like Johnson working to save them.  Confoundingly, the threats are not just the storms and rising seas and increased rates of erosion brought by climate change, but the human reaction to it. Along the bay west of Chapin Beach, each new stone sea wall or rocky protrusion jutting into the ocean helps to preserve one piece of property by collecting eroding sand. But each one also prevents that sand from traveling to the beach downstream. The solution in one place exacerbates the problem in another. The projects proceed, property by property, pushing the problem downstream, each preserving a small part of the Cape by ruining it, just a little bit, until there's no beach left.  “I don't know what Cape Cod is without beaches, said Andrew Gottlieb," director of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod. “Living on a Cape without beaches is kind of an unimaginable thing. Why would you do that?"""" This shortsightedness about climate change is hardly unique to the Cape. It is a global failing of unmistakable consequence", here and almost everywhere.  Nothing about preserving the essence of the Cape will be easy. The sandy shores of the Cape's coastline are inherently malleable, shifting in response to storms and sea level rise. The roads and neighborhoods and buildings? Not so much.  In all, about 20 percent of the Cape is now within the special flood hazard area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That represents more than $29 billion in property, including over 1,500 historic structures.  The state, local Cape governments, and conservation groups have all poured time and money into protecting the coastline and the environment from the effects of climate change. Millions of dollars in grants, working groups packed with national experts, and voluminous, detailed reports have made Massachusetts a national leader in the field.  One recent example: Through its Resilient Cape Cod project, funded by a $780,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Cape Cod Commission, the regional planning and regulatory agency on the Cape, has identified dozens of strategies to protect the Cape's coasts from the rising seas and major storms. These include open space requirements that allow natural land to migrate inland; building dunes and marshes and something called living shorelines, which combine such minor hard barriers as low rock walls with natural wetlands; incentives to help homeowners move their houses out of harm's way — a process known as retreat. But getting through to the public and persuading property owners to take heed has proved to be difficult.  “People are resistant to that 'retreat' word, said Kristy Senatori," the commission's executive director. “They prefer to fortify instead. They prefer the short-term solutions like putting sand on a beach.""""  So much is threatened here that some 8",000 homes were added to the flood plain in 2014, the last time the federal government updated its maps. Flood-proofing homes can be both complicated and expensive, said Shannon Jarbeau, a flood plain manager who works with communities all over the Cape to enforce building codes that help drive down flood insurance rates, which now average about $2,000 a year. Such costs are sure to accelerate a trend which already threatens something that makes the Cape special, compared to its island neighbors — economic diversity, the working class and the well-to-do mingling where sand meets sea. “There's a significant potential, Jarbeau said," “for gentrification of the coast."""" One day in June", a cement mixer rolled into the parking lot at Herring Cove Beach in Provincetown, preparing to pour a pad for a new emergency phone: Dial in case of sharks.  The presence of great white sharks in the waters around the Cape, lured by a booming seal population, has fundamentally changed the way people interact with the beaches here. Walk onto any public beach on the Cape and you'll pass a menacing sign warning that something deadly could be lurking not too far off shore.  But the more existential danger is the water itself.  Along Herring Cove, a patchwork of flimsy wooden fencing bigger than a football field extends down the beach here, designed to catch sand and encourage a dune system to rebuild. Native grasses are planted in perfect rows like crops. A new, freshly paved parking lot is behind the fledgling dunes.  As the sea rises and erosion does its steady work, this is what retreat looks like: A new parking lot, built about 200 feet inland from the old. A bath house built on pilings so it can be scooped up and moved again in a few decades.  Dunes were coaxed back to life. The effort cost about $3 million and is decidedly temporary, said Mark Adams, a coastal geographer at the National Seashore.  There were other options, none of them perfect. A rock wall might have lasted a bit longer, but pretty soon you'd lose the beach. The ocean does not negotiate. A few feet out in the shallows, a cockeyed concrete piling protrudes from the water: This used to be a road. A seal bobbed by as if out for a stroll.  The strategic retreat at Herring Cove is a model for how things could go elsewhere on the Cape and around the world, said Adams. It does minimal damage to the surrounding area, preserves public access to a place people love. It also leaves decisions about what to do when the water threatens the parking lot again to the next generation of residents.  Like so much around here, it won't last. When the big one comes To lay eyes upon what happened in Provincetown two winters ago — and to glimpse what will surely happen again — begin in the basement of Jerry Swartz's Commercial Street liquor store, where the water crashed through a bulkhead door and filled the basement.  Today, the dried detritus of January 2018's storm still lines the pipes that criss-cross overhead in the darkened stockroom. A single sea gull feather the length of a toddler's finger is wedged in a fitting at the bottom of the stairs.  “I was in the Coast Guard. I've seen what water can do to the hull of a ship. But this was something else," Swartz said. “We've had trickles . . .  but never enough that the water came down the stairwell.""""  The water rushed down Commercial Street", crashing into the art galleries and bars, bed & breakfasts that are packed densely into the town's tourist center.  The January storm badly damaged Julie Heller's art gallery on the beach, her iconic sign — the word ART spelled out with seaweed — protruding incongruously from the flood waters. The handmade windows and doors buckled.  “It had never flooded there, ever, Heller said. “I didn't have business insurance because it had never flooded," and it was off season."""" More than a year later", weeds grew up and through her husband's old sports car, still parked in the sand. And all those paintings were still in storage.  Nearby, the old Unitarian Universalist Meeting House, built in 1826 on the far side of Commercial Street from the ocean had seemed secure. But flood pathways can be counter-intuitive: When the water arrived, it came first from the back door, which faces away from the beach.  Even after the storm, the water stubbornly refused to recede. When someone hoisted up the bulkhead in the boiler room behind the downstairs hall, they found tiny fish swimming just below the floor. The problems didn't stop when the water receded. One day, the pastor, Kate Wilkinson, spotted tiny hills of sawdust under the old wooden benches in the lobby. Powder post beetles that had been dormant in the wood for years or decades had begun gnawing their way out.  “My entire job changed," said the Rev. Wilkinson. “I was still a minister but I was also a project manager."""" Some days she wore a respirator mask to church. The town had spent years preparing for flooding like this", using a state grant to study risks and mapping vulnerable areas. And it has redoubled its efforts in the two years since. To shore up the path that flood waters followed in 2018, the town is planning to build a large dune at the end of Gosnold Street, where Heller's gallery still sits. The necessary preparations are physical, but they're also psychological and financial: Plan, protect, and insure.  But the reality is that there's only so much to be done. In the case of the grand old meeting house, there's nowhere to move: Downtown Provincetown is densely packed. Elevating a massive, nearly 200-year-old building listed in the National Register of Historic Places — one of more than 500 such structures in the flood plain in Provincetown — would be an iffy undertaking, and a very costly one.  And then Wilkinson asked an unpleasant question — one that the next storm, or the one after that," may make impossible to ignore.  “How important is it to raise a building if the town is not going to be here?"""" she said.  This is the notion that some on the Cape are not quite ready to confront.  “If there is a hurricane that takes out a lot of the Cape"," what does that mean for Cape Cod?"""" wondered Heather McElroy", natural resources program manager at the Cape Cod Commission. “Maybe it means elevating structures. It means building more densely in more appropriate areas that are actually out of the flood plain. That's all longer term," and the community isn't there yet."""" The 2018 storms in January and March were in some ways an unwelcome reminder of that reality. They flooded homes in the Little Beach neighborhood in Chatham and trapped drivers on Route 6A in West Barnstable. The Bass Hole boardwalk in Yarmouth Port was destroyed. In Sandwich", deep water pooled in front of the police and fire stations and slashed away the foundation of homes on Salt Marsh Road that still are uninhabitable.  But those storms? The ones that claimed Liam's and soaked Provincetown? That destroyed houses on the bay and on Ballston Beach? That flooded out coastal roads all over the Cape and stranded low-lying homeowners for days?  By historical standards, those nor'easters would be nothing compared to an honest-to-God hurricane. In 1991, Hurricane Bob brought a storm surge of nearly 12 feet to Buzzards Bay and knocked out power to the whole Cape.  And even Bob does not compare to the Great New England Hurricane of 1938.  That pushed 15 feet of storm surge into Bourne and Wareham. Much of the western edge of the Cape was under several feet of water.  The devastation a storm like that would bring today is difficult to picture. But from a cluttered office at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Jeff Donnelly and his team of researchers are using a computer simulation to help us see it. In the 81 years since the 1938 storm, the sea level here has risen about a foot, Donnelly said, and is now rising faster than it has in thousands of years. And the land has changed at least as much. The Cape was a different place then — the canal bridges had opened just three years earlier. The population was a fifth of what it is now. Thousands of homes and other buildings have been erected in the intervening decades, many perilously close to the coast.  Donnelly and his team are working to turn their storm surge calculations into images of today's Cape. When complete, we will be able to see what would happen here if one of the major weather events of the last 400 years were to strike again, the water flowing over and through today's landscape, following complex and sometimes counter-intuitive pathways inland. If the storm of 1938 churned north toward the Cape today, its strong right arm pummeling Buzzards Bay, evacuations would be ordered. The 11-mile backup at the Sagamore Bridge that preceded Bob would be at least that bad. Those who waited too long to abandon the Outer Cape would find the Orleans Rotary and dozens of other evacuation routes flooded as the eye of the storm passed over Long Island.  The 1938 storm arrived as a Category 3 hurricane, pummeling the Cape with powerful winds. It killed 564 people, injured three times that many, and destroyed almost 9,000 homes. And today, there is much more at risk.  Buzzards Bay would act like a funnel, driving storm surge higher until the sea swallowed such places as New Silver Beach and the houses that line its streets. Surf Drive in Falmouth, where runners stampede during the famous Falmouth Road Race every August, would be submerged, the underground sewer line spilling into the open ocean. The Woods Hole dock, which hundreds of scientists like Donnelly use to study precisely this problem," would be obliterated. When the Cape Cod Commission prepared what it called a “Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan"""" in 2010", the dozens of state and local officials and scientists studying the impact of a potential major hurricane dared not even guess at the scope of what might be destroyed. The plan found some 20 percent of the Cape, 70 square miles, could be inundated during a hurricane. That includes dozens of critical facilities, including hospitals, utilities, government facilities.  And the storm itself would just be the beginning. Its surge would affect the shoreline after the storm passed, washing roads and leaving streets impassable. Wells from which people draw drinking water would be inundated, brackish water pouring into kitchen sinks. Electricity could be out for weeks or months.  Recovery would take years and the cost in dollars and time would be incalculable. The Cape would never be the same. Donnelly's calculus relies on data from the storms the Cape has known. But climate change is changing storms themselves, potentially increasing their frequency and intensity and even changing the patterns of their movement, said Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth.  A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, providing more fuel for storms like those that hit in 2018.  “That really is the battery that storms draw their energy from, Francis said. A storm that started its northward journey under the same meteorological conditions as the great hurricane of 1938 would likely arrive even more powerful and destructive. And such devastating events will likely happen more often.  Meanwhile, the rapid warming of the arctic has caused a considerable slowing trend in the jetstream, Francis explained, causing weather that would have otherwise moved more rapidly north to get stuck in place, its destructive power lingering. Jutting out into this corner of the North Atlantic, built on a pile of sand and rock, the Cape was vulnerable long before people began walking its beaches. Still, something is different now. The last hundred or so years of human activity have ratcheted up that risk, fueling storms even as we build more and more in this perfect place in their path. It is not hypothetical. It has happened before and it will happen again.  But that is difficult to see, and harder to believe, until the water arrives at the back door.  Thousands of years To see what is happening on this bit of sand sticking out into the ocean, you have to know where to look. But that's not all. You also have to know how to look. When to look. You have to see past and present, thousands of years all at once.  “I've been here all my life, and I've seen pristine and that's not what we have now, said Chuckie Green, the natural resources director for the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe.  Green grew up swimming in Santuit Pond, back before cyanobacteria turned it murky and green, unsafe for people and their pets. He used to fish here, then eat the fish. Popponesset Bay was overflowing with oysters. Sweet grass that the tribe used for ceremonial and medicinal purposes still grew thick in the high marsh.  “It was a great place to live, I'll tell you what, Green said.  Today, storms and sea tear up the marsh and the shore and the sweetgrass. The winter moths feast on the white oaks from which the tribe once picked acorns to supplement the corn harvest. The red cedars down by the ocean are disappearing.  “The worst thing is I get to see it right out my window, Green said.  But seeing it — really seeing it, the way Green can — is the only way to save it.  “That's why I do what I do, said Green," 65. “I have grandchildren. I would like to preserve a little portion of what I had. I can't preserve it all.""""  Maybe we can't", either. All those cars keep coming across those grand old bridges, trailing plumes of climate-warming emissions and transporting visitors eager for the wonders of the Cape but reluctant to confront what is happening. But for so many of the people who live here — the people who've learned how to see what's being lost — this is an occasion for fear, but not for fatalism. It is not an excuse to do nothing; it is a reason to do more.  The waves crash like they always do, but they are not the same. They come from the open ocean now. Families play on beaches that look like they always have, but the sand is not the same, either. The birds, the bugs, the marsh; the forest, the fish, the food: They're still here, and worth saving, even if they're different.  If we can still see it, we can still save it. But only if we look.

1006,1867262665,"Sometimes the most acrimonious divisions can be bridged by having people just talk to each other civilly and face-to-face. That is the simple philosophy behind Daryl Davis's project. Best known as a blues musician who has played with the likes of Chuck Berry and Little Richard, Davis spends his spare time socializing and befriending members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis -- an odd and potentially dangerous hobby because Davis is black. For many of these people, Davis is the first African American they have ever spoken to, and in some cases he has so impressed them that Klansman have dropped out of the organization, giving Davis their discarded robes and hoods, of which he now has a large collection. In Matt Ornstein's documentary ""Accidental Courtesy,"" Davis roams the United States meeting both alt-right individuals and young civil rights activists -- and some of the latter have reservations about his tactics. The film shows what can be accomplished if we expand our range of communication beyond soundbites, slogans, social media. ""Accidental Courtesy"" premieres on PBS's ""Independent Lens"" at 10 p.m. on Monday. www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/accidental-courtesy   Person of color  As a child, Edythe ""Edy"" Boone dreamed of inventing a color that no one had ever seen before. She hasn't accomplished that yet, but the San Francisco-based African American septuagenarian has for decades created lush expansive art. She has inspired and directed communities in creating murals that have become more urgent in political and social content after the killings of unarmed black men such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner -- her nephew. Marlene ""Mo"" Morris's documentary ""A New Color -- The Art of Being Edythe Boone"" examines the fascinating life and vivid work of this muralist, activist, and educator. Born in East Harlem and self-taught, Boone first became fascinated with the visual arts as a child visiting her grandmother, a seamstress whose home was filled with a wealth of fabrics of different colors, patterns, and textures -- an influence that can be seen in Boone's artwork. She spent her early years raised by an Orthodox Jewish family that encouraged her interest in different cultures. In the 1960s, influenced by the Black Panthers and civil rights movement generally, her work became more political. Over the decades, as her work evolved, her determination to transform the world through art and activism has only grown stronger.  ""A New Color -- The Art of Being Edythe Boone"" can be seen on Tuesday at 8 p.m. on ""America Reframed"" on PBS's WORLD channel. It will stream for free starting Wednesday at worldchannel.org/programs/episode/arf-s5-501-new-color-edythe-boone/.   Home wreckers I  A favorite vacation spot for the rich and famous, Martha's Vineyard is also the home of residents who aren't so rich and famous. Some are concerned watching these newcomers build bigger and bigger mansions, consuming resources, taking over land, and destroying older homes. Thomas Bena once made a living as a carpenter working on this new construction. But after a while something didn't seem right about it, and he decided to make a documentary. His film, ""One Big Home,"" investigates the wave of gentrification sweeping the island and turning it into a collection of virtual fiefdoms. He riles up home owners and contractors as he tries to find out who's benefiting and who's losing out. ""One Big Home"" will be screened by newportFILM on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Casino Theatre, 9 Freebody St., Newport, R.I. After the screening there will be a conversation between the filmmaker and Aquidneck Land Trust spokesman Chuck Allot. bit.ly/BigHomeDoc   Home wreckers II  In Ted Roach's ""120 Days,"" Miguel Cortes, a husband and the father of two daughters, has the title length of time to settle his affairs and leave the United States for his native Mexico. When his illegal status was discovered after a routine traffic stop, Cortes was presented with this harsh order by a North Carolina judge, leaving him with the choice of obeying the law and abandoning his family or ignoring it and disappearing into the underground as a wanted man. Roach puts a human face on the numbers and issues involved in the country's debate over immigration.

Frederick Wiseman's documentary ""Meat"" (1976) is as raw as the title suggests and as well prepared as a beef bourguignon. The institute subjected to Wiseman's unblinking eye is the Monfort plant in Greeley, Colo., a vast factory that transforms warm-blooded animals into tasty cuts ready for the broiler. It's bad enough watching a steer get gradually reduced to various parts, with severed tongues hanging from hooks and ranks of disembodied heads staring into the void. But then they bring on the lambs. The real subjects to pity here, however, are the workers who keep the factory running. Regimented as in any assembly line, they perform their meticulous carnage with the precision of an auto factory. Their faces are as numb as their white aprons are bloody. These are the real victims of mass consumption, Wiseman suggests in what might not be his best film but is probably his most horrifying.

166,2431186244,"When Las Cafeteras, one of the leading bands in the vibrant Chicano roots scene, got together 12 years ago, they were a bunch of young Mexican-American activists in Los Angeles, bonding over political commitments at an arts center inspired by Zapatista revolutionaries on the city's east side. Back then, George W. Bush was president, immigration reform was still on the table, the gentrification of Los Angeles was still in low gear. In Boyle Heights, City Terrace, and East LA, Chicano activists and artists clustered in cafes and community spaces. At the East Side Café, they studied son jarocho, Afro-Mexican folk music from Veracruz, with its fast rhythms — tapped out on a platform called a tarima — and its culture of festive gatherings, full of audience participation, called fandangos. “It was a bunch of movement kids who wanted to learn how to play,"" says band member Hector Flores, who sings and plays jarana, a compact guitar-like instrument. “We'd play in coffee shops, at protests and marches. Then a group of us wanted to play together, as an experiment, and that's the group you see today."" Today, Las Cafeteras — with a core group of Flores, his brother David Flores, Leah Gallegos, Daniel French, Denise Carlos, and Jose Cano — have become a major act on both the activist circuit and the booming alt-Latino and new-roots scenes. Their big, bright second album, “Tastes Like L.A.,"" came out in April; they play the Museum of Fine Arts on July 26, as part of the museum's summer outdoor series. Much has changed over the years, including their sound. “We wanted to move away from son jarocho,"" says Flores. “It's our foundation, but it's a real musical form and culture from southern Veracruz, and we wanted to create music that was real for us here in LA. We wanted to break free, even if that meant a really eclectic album."" Indeed, “Tastes Like L.A."" careens happily across themes and styles, tossing in reggae-like grooves on “Paletero,"" an ode to the ice-cream vendors who push carts in the street, a frenetic norteño Spanish cover of “This Land Is Your Land,"" midtempo romance on “Apache,"" and a very California celebration of the ocean in “Vamos to the Beach."" There's rapping, too, on “If I Was President,"" a song Flores wrote based on conversations with the Mexican employees at his local supermarket. At the same time, the instruments — the fretted jaranas and requinto, the cajon percussion, the strong-heeled shoes for the zapateado dance — remain the core set used in son jarocho, and on at least one track, “La Morena,"" the band shows it hasn't abandoned the style that brought them together. Their politics, too, have held firm. “Paletero,"" the ice-cream song, is also a nod to the long campaigns in Los Angeles to legalize street vending, which has been working its way through the city council after years of pushing by activist groups. And “Morena,"" a tribute to dark-skinned women, is also an environmental song. “The lyrics talk about how we mistreat Mother Earth, yet we need her,"" Flores says, citing the Standing Rock protests over the Dakota Access pipeline project. “It's an homage not only to brown-skinned women but to brown-skinned Earth."" “Tastes Like L.A."" is also a document of change in its namesake city. Flores says gentrification and the rise in housing costs have disturbed the community life of the early days. The group has scattered: Once all on the East Side, now they live spread out from South Central to distant Ventura. “We're a microcosm of what's happened to our city,"" Flores says. The arts network has frayed in the process. “Organizations and spaces that have been home to the arts are fighting to stay alive,"" Flores says. “The need to support local spaces that still exist is much more now."" At the same time, a new generation keen to explore its roots is driving a creative boom. “There's a powerful scene now,"" Flores says. In LA, acts like Chicano Batman and Santa Cecilia have joined pioneers Ozomatli and Quetzal, with peers around the country. They cross-fertilize with like-minded projects coming out of other immigrant communities: For instance, Las Cafeteras recently shared a bill and good vibes with Brooklyn neo-Punjabi brass band Red Baraat. “There's a connection of people who are remixing their roots but growing up in the States,"" Flores says. “I call it future folk."" Las Cafeteras are moving into this future through some personal loss. In 2015, original member Annette Torres left the group, accusing bandmates of sexism and callous behavior. The episode caused a stir on the local scene and forced the band, which considers itself leaderless and consensus-driven, into introspection and healing work. “The anger and fight that exists in us can create animosity and be unhealthy,"" Flores says now. “But the work has been powerful, and we understand that we really love each other. We want to make music together because we love each other, and this is what we need to do.""

815,1914746554,"Joanne Lumpkins was trimming the roses in front of her house on Fuller Street when the fire broke out on the roof of the Treadmark, the soon-to-open condo and apartment building that used to be the old Ashmont Tire. You can hit a sand wedge from Lumpkins's front yard and hit the Treadmark on the corner of Fuller and Dorchester Avenue. While tens of thousands watched the conflagration via helicopter video shots, Lumpkins retired to the comfort of her front porch and watched the whole thing from a chair. “What surprised me most,"" she said, “is that the whole damn thing is made of wood."" Well, at least the top four floors are.  Lumpkins was shaking her head. “I grew up in the Lenox Street projects,"" she said, “and the way they built them, if a fire broke out it was contained to a single apartment. If they could do it back then, why can't they do it now?"" The Treadmark cost about $45 million, but it would have cost a lot more if it were built like one of those ubiquitous steel and concrete million-dollar condos in the Seaport. But the wood makes the condos and the apartments in Dorchester more affordable, and the bottom line is the bottom line: Boston needs more affordable condos and apartments. Lumpkins is 73 years old. She and her husband have lived on Fuller Street for 36 years. They have watched their neighborhood rise and rise and become desirable to people who wouldn't have considered moving there just a few years ago. The Treadmark, and before that the Carruth building just across Dot Ave, are monuments to the ongoing gentrification of Ashmont. The six-alarm blaze that left the Treadmark's roof collapsed showed that fire can do nothing to gentrification except slow it down. And that's fine with Lumpkins and Selena Penix, 55, who has lived on Fuller Street with her husband for 25 years. They appreciate the new stores and amenities. While some bemoan the rising property values, they've turned away speculators who've shown up at their doors, offering cash to buy their houses. They're not going anywhere. “When the Carruth opened, I thought, 'Should we sell our house and move in there?' But we decided against it,"" Penix said. Penix was putting groceries away when she noticed the TV station had broken away from scheduled programming to show a big building on fire. “I said, 'That's my street.' So I went down Fuller and looked up and I could see the fire on the roof,"" she said. “I kept going back home, but I kept coming back because the fire wouldn't go out."" It was one of those fires they call stubborn. Deputy Fire Chief Mike Doherty and District Chief Jim Greene had to prioritize the safety of their firefighters, and when the roof, loaded with heavy ventilation and air conditioning units, began to sag, they got those firefighters off the roof. They contained the fire by throwing water, then foam, on it. Fire Commissioner Joe Finn, who struck a sixth alarm not long after arriving at the scene, said the Treadmark's sprinkler system was inoperable. It's not yet known whether the system malfunctioned or simply wasn't turned on. He said the construction adhered to state and federal regulations. “These [types of] buildings are safe as long as the sprinkler system is functional,"" Finn said. The building burned less than 24 hours before it was due for its fire safety inspection. Residents were expected to move in July 15. One of those residents, a Boston firefighter, was supposed to sign papers on his place Thursday. Trinity Financial, the developer behind the Treadmark, vowed to rebuild. People from Trinity, including cofounder Jim Keefe, live in the neighborhood. Fire happens, wood or no wood. The fire that ruined the Treadmark could have been worse. “I'm just glad no one was living there yet,"" Selena Penix said. “You can replace anything but a life.""  Kevin Cullen is a Globe columnist.

75,2082131653,"What are Dunkin’s new treats like? We decided to bite the donut (fries). By Janelle Nanos GLOBE STAFF A s the Globe’s resident retail retail reporter, I can expect to receive a breathless email email about Dunkin’ Donuts’ Donuts’ latest menu offerings offerings about once a week. This past month alone, I’ve gotten missives from its public relations team about Girl Scout cookie-flavored coffee drinks, mint brownie doughnuts, and something about a brown sugar chipotle chipotle bacon breakfast sandwich. Rarely do these e-mails make me bat an eye.. . until last week, when I saw Dunkin’ was experimenting with a completely “new” product, donut fries. These “fries” are part of Dunkin’s new “Gotta Have $2 Snacks” afternoon menu, which is being tested in a few select locations in Boston. As someone who appreciates a delicious delicious churro — the cinnamon-and-sugar-dusted cinnamon-and-sugar-dusted fried dough treat native to Spain and now found across Latin America — I was intrigued. It turns out, so was the rest of the Internet. “Dunkin’ Donuts ‘inventing’ donut fries is the gentrification of the churro,” wrote one Twitter user. “You dorks just made a churro and pretended you didn't just steal the idea from Spanish-speakers,” wrote another. another. Could a retail chain come close to recreating the sublime crunchy-sweet confection I first sampled in the latenight latenight churrerias of Madrid? I had to find out. And since my editors wanted to know how the rest of the menu stacked up, I decided to test it too. Which is how I came to spend $42 on an armful of $2 treats on Monday afternoon. afternoon. I recruited some colleagues, who represented a full range in terms of their declared degree of Dunkin’ apA apA return to classic elegance and old-school dining ► DINING OUT Continued from Page G1 quats. This could be a clever take on Peking duck, with kumquats standing in for hoisin sauce and spelt crepes for the usual pancakes. That dish would feel very 2018. Instead what we get reminisces about the reign of New American bistro fare: rosy slices of duck arrayed over puffy pancakes, topped with hazelnuts and jammy bites of kumquat. It isn’t retro enough to be retro — yet. Chef Carolyn Johnson’s menu takes us back to a time when restaurants were restaurants, not small-plates free-for-alls where “everyone shares family-style,” triggering the survival mechanisms of anyone who grew up in a household with more than two siblings. siblings. There is no need to gobble here. Everything comes in order, not “as it is ready.” Honestly, it’s a relief. Anyone who spends time on social media will welcome an experience with clear personal personal boundaries. First there is bread — a thick slice of sourdough, a puffy roll — placed on your plate by someone bearing a tray and tongs. (Later, someone else will appear to sweep away the crumbs.) It comes with a little crock of very good, softened butter, and the bread itself is very good too. It’s not a knock on the rest of the food to say that this is one of preciation. The full snack menu attempts attempts to cover your cravings from savory savory to sweet, and so we worked our way through the menu with that in mind. Ham and cheese wrap If you’ve ever rolled up a slice of ham and American cheese in a flour tortilla, and then microwaved it for 20 seconds, then congratulations! — you’re now qualified to sell them to America for $2 a pop. The wraps were “underwhelming” according to testers. “It is simply a wake-up wrap without the egg that has been rolled into a cigar-like shape,” said one Dunkin’ aficionado, “there is nothing new in the taste or components other than the shape.” Pretzel bites with honey mustard dipping sauce The small pretzel nubs are about the size of a Munchkin, but don’t deliver deliver nearly the same degree of pleasure. The consensus was they were too dry and doughy. “It's very dense, it’s like somebody compacted a dinner roll,” one tester said. Another pretzel expert opined: “The whole point of a pretzel is to maximize the surface area — the brown coating that you put salt on — relative to the amount of dough used. These are spheres, so you get the least amount of brown surface that’s mathematically mathematically possible for a given lump of dough. Literally any other shape would produce a better pretzel.” Waffle breaded chicken tenders The manager of the Dunkin’ Donuts Donuts store at 265 Franklin St., Fahima Jahan, said the tenders became a bestthe bestthe meal’s most-pleasurable moments. There are plenty: a mackerel crudo with slices of bracingly fresh fish arrayed arrayed in an arc around the plate, crimson crimson edges aligned, striped with sprinkled sprinkled chives, Meyer lemon rind, and smoked chile, all in balance. Tima tartare tartare is pretty gorgeous, too, with its sprinkle of pistachios and underlying funk of just enough foie gras. Again, balance. Soup’s not on menus much these days: too hard to share. Here we get two. The Mooncusser chowder is an elegant elegant version, a thin broth stocked with clams, smoked scallops, and skate. The soup crackers are shaped like crescent moons, a charming touch that makes everyone smile. There’s also also turnip soup with poached oysters and pear cream. Again, elegance. Much of Mooncusser’s success derives derives from the simple-yet-not-so-simple simple-yet-not-so-simple thing of a good piece of fish cooked well. Halibut is seared golden, the mild, flaky flesh accented with flavor from nasturtium butter and segments of grapefruit, served with parsley-root puree, root-vegetable hash, and springy circles of halibut mousseline. Whole scup comes striped black with grill marks, over celeriac puree and wild rice, salsa verde draped across its middle like a sash. The foundation is always in place.

We managed to score the last two orders, and among the savory savory selections, these were a clear favorite favorite among the test group. “The chicken was moist, and the coating tasted like frozen waffles, and not in a bad way. I’d eat these as a guilty pleasure,” pleasure,” said one tester. Munchkin dippers Have you ever eaten a Munchkin and thought: Hmm, I wish I had a way to add more calories to this snack? You’re now in luck. The half-dozen dough balls come with their own chocolate chocolate dipping sauce, Which is really the only thing that distinguishes them from other Munchkins. Unfortunately, the sauce was underwhelming and PHOTOS BY JOHN TLUMACKI/GLOBE STAFF Top (from left): Squid ink chitarra and baba au rhum at Mooncusser Fish House.

Dishes that sound lavish, thrilling watery. “The chocolate sauce is too runny and doesn’t enhance the Munchkins,” was a common complaint. complaint. Warm chocolate chip cookies Dunkin’ has rolled out cookies in the past, and these were totally serviceable serviceable for an afternoon pick-me-up. The chocolate was still melty, while the cookie itself was crunchier than it looked. “I dipped a half a cookie in the chocolate dipping sauce and am still having a sugar rush,” said one tester. Gluten-free brownies Amid the sugar binge, the glutenfree glutenfree brownies were a bit of an afterthought, afterthought, but they shouldn’t be. Moist and chewy, they were satisfying, though a teeny bit oily. They’re also the only new snack item that is in the — fennel custard with uni and truffles; monkfish with caviar, kohlrabi, and tarragon bourride — don’t always taste that way. The uni is so fresh it’s practically practically quivering, but the custard lacks flavor, stiff rather than silky. The monkfish needs seasoning; the flavors don’t pop. Order creme fraiche panna cotta for dessert and you get a few gelatinous blobs strewn across the plate. Espresso semifreddo is intense, encased in a hard shell of dark chocolate; the pistachio-dusted pistachio-dusted fragments of meringue are my favorite part. But the clear winner is pastry chef Katie Hamilburg’s baba au rhum, a boozy little cake that arrives arrives in a pool of caramel with bananas and a granola-esque crisp. It’s tomorrow’s tomorrow’s trend today. Yesterday’s, too. Mooncusser Fish House is one of those maddening restaurants that can serve you your best meal in months on one visit, a merely middling one the next. But it was so good last time! Will it be so good next time? There’s only one way to find out. The dining room’s setup is slightly awkward — the two-top banquettes in the middle of the room are so extremely extremely comfortable, but they put you headto-head headto-head with the diner behind you. It’s a great setup for passing intelligence, a bad one for private conversation. So take a table beside those winTAYLOR winTAYLOR DELENCH/GLOBE STAFF grab-and-go section of the stores and come pre-wrapped for freshness. Donut fries As we worked our way through the taste-test, morale was lagging, as too few snacks were stacking up to expectations. expectations. Then we got to the donut fries and recruited Brian McGrory, the Globe’s editor and a certified foodie, to step in. His reaction upon the first bite was immediate: “Holy s*&% these are good.” The consensus among the testers testers was that the fries were a worthy snack, though those who have experienced experienced the true beauty of a deeply fried churro said they don’t come close to what you’ll find in Spain.

378,2130647051,"A fifth of all housing units in Boston have some type of income restriction placed on them, according to a new city study that officials are calling a crucial part of their efforts to create more affordable units in neighborhoods where they're needed most.  The study found that of the city's 54,247 income-restricted housing units — 20 percent of the total housing stock — 66 percent were restricted to households that earn less than 50 percent of the area median income, or $43,150 for a two-person household.  Of that 66 percent, 20,746 units, or 38 percent, are restricted for households making 31 to 50 percent of the area median income, or $25,900 to $43,000 for a two-person household.  The study does not address non-restricted units that are being rented at or sold at market-rate prices, which has led in many cases to increased rents, gentrification of neighborhoods, and a citywide affordable housing crisis.  But officials said the review, the first of its kind, provides a analysis of the city's housing stock and provides insight as they seek to develop more income-restricted housing.  The study found that Boston has the highest percentage of income-restricted housing of any major city in the country, officials said.  “This report helps us understand how many income-restricted units there are, where they are, and to whom they are affordable, all important information as we work to increase affordable housing opportunities in our neighborhoods,"" Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement.  South End and Lower Roxbury had the highest percentage of income-restricted housing, at 48 percent of the total housing stock, while Roxbury had 45 percent, and Charlestown and Jamaica Plain each had 25 percent.  The review, called Income-Restricted Housing in Boston and conducted by the Department of Neighborhood Development, examined data from the Boston Housing Authority, as well as information on privately owned housing built with city funding or subsidies, or on city-owned land. The review was in response to Walsh's “Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030"" plan to develop tens of thousands of housing units over the next decade, as the city faces an anticipated population boom.  Walsh recently increased the overall 2030 target from 53,000 new units of housing to 69,000, including 15,820 income-restricted units.  The city defines a unit as being income-restricted when the restrictions are set out in a deed.

In total, 95 percent of all income-restricted housing are rental units.  Vanessa Calderon-Rosado, CEO of the South End community development corporation Inquilinos Boricuas En Accion, and co-chair of the Mayor's Housing Task Force, said in a statement that the report reflects the work to preserve income restricted housing in the city, specifically in the South End and Lower Roxbury.

Flying to N.Y. about to get a lot cooler ►CHESTO Continued from Page Cl sometime next summer. Service would be seasonal, with flights for about nine months a year — it’s tough to fly these planes in sub-freezing weather. The aircraft would be ninepassenger ninepassenger Cessna 208 Caravans; Cape Air still needs to buy or lease the two planes it needs. Wolf says the one-way price would be in the $300-to-$400 range because he wants to stay competitive competitive with the walk-up fares for LaGuardia LaGuardia shuttles at Logan. Of course, the real appeal is this: getting to Manhattan from the Seaport Seaport in 70 minutes or so, without the hassles of navigating airports or getting getting to and from them. Another company may be hot on Cape Air’s tail. Alan Ram, of Tailwind Air, says he expects to secure his company’s company’s FAA letter for Boston seaplanes by the end of the year, with a goal of starting flights next summer. He expects expects the pricing would be similar to Cape Air’s. There’s enough room in this market, he says, for both operators. operators. A number of business leaders in Boston have long wanted a way to get to NYC in a hurry, without the usual airport headaches. But the city has been without a general purpose helipad helipad for roughly two decades. Some had hoped that General Electric’s arrival in town two years ago would prompt movement on that front. But the idea kicked up an uproar uproar in South Boston, and GE quickly backed away. Seaplanes, Wolf is quick to point out, have a much smaller impact than choppers. There would probably be fewer flights, for example, and none at night. Wolf, a former state senator from Cape Cod, says his team has held more than 90 meetings in and around Boston to discuss the concept, address community concerns, and get feedback. feedback. Wolf started down this runway at least five years ago, first meeting with former mayor Tom Menino to sound out the idea. Now, Wolf hopes to complete complete the journey under Mayor Marty Walsh’s watch. There’s no rush for Cape Air, he says. Wolf is a trained pilot, pilot, as well as a CEO.

355,2161762248,"Violent crime in Boston was down in 2018 compared to the prior year, with the homicide rate essentially holding steady and the total number of fatal and non-fatal shooting victims decreasing by about 22 percent, according to police statistics released Monday. The numbers from the Boston Police Department show there were 56 murders in 2018, down from 57 in 2017 but more than the five-year average of 48.  Overall, significantly fewer people in the city were shot, with 202 victims of non-fatal and fatal shootings reported in 2018, down from 260 the prior year, according to the statistics. That mirrors a wider downward trend in violent crime, with 4,182 violent offenses logged in 2018, compared to 4,423 in 2017.  “I think it's important that we reflect on why the numbers are down,"" said Boston police Commissioner William G. Grossin a phone interview. “It's our policing model. Community policing is directly involved in reducing these stats.""  One community activist said the drop in crime is a positive sign.  When compared to American cities of a similar size, Boston “is doing well"" when it comes to public safety, said the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III, cofounder of the Boston TenPoint Coalition, an anti-violence group.  Still, more outreach and intervention is needed for the city's at-risk youth, particularly at the middle school level, he said. “The city doesn't have a clear picture at all in terms of what's going on in the middle schools,"" he said.  The dip in crime can also be attributed to socio-economic factors, Rivers said. Boston, he said, is morphing “into a boutique town,"" noting the gentrification of some city neighborhoods. “Crime will decline because numbers of the poor will decline,"" he said. The Rev. John Connolly, a Boston police chaplain said the dip in crime is “probably a result of a whole bunch of factors, not the least of which is the cooperation between the police department and awhole lot of groups,"" “Community policing is starting to pay off in Boston,"" said Connolly, who is also a parish priest at St. Theresa of Avila in West Roxbury. Among the other highlights in the report were a decrease in robberies, with 1,164 reported in 2018, down from 1,382 the year before. A 2018 total of 1,817 burglaries from commercial and residential properties compared favorably to the 2,129 burglary reports generated in 2017.  Reports for a couple types of crimes did increase slightly.  There were 854 reports of domestic aggravated assault in 2018, compared to 804 in 2017, amid a five-year average of 851. And while total larceny numbers were down, the 7,851 reports in 2018 of larceny from property other than a motor vehicle came in higher than the 2017 tally of 7,710 such reports.  Cops also locked up fewer suspects in 2018.  All told, city police made 9,425 arrests, compared to 10,687 in 2017. The five-year average is 12,626.  Gross said Monday that arrests and crime can decrease simultaneously “because of [city] programs and initiatives"" designed to help at-risk youth.  “As always, we want to knock down senseless youth violence, knock down the number of homicides,"" Gross said, adding that unsolved murders remain a priority for his department. “We don't say 'cold cases.'

868,2162945300,"EASTHAMPTON — Chris O'Leary saw David Bowie perform just the one time, at the Hartford Civic Center. It was the summer of 1990. O'Leary was a high school student in Connecticut. Bowie was in the middle of his international Sound+Vision tour, which was billed as a last hurrah for his vast catalog of hits.  It was a good show, but then again, so was the Rush concert O'Leary caught around the same time. To the future writer, Bowie was just another tile in the big mosaic of classic rock. A dazzling, prismatic tile, to be sure, but still. So it's as surprising to O'Leary as anyone that his life has come to revolve around Bowie's music. After graduating from Boston University (where he dabbled in film criticism), he began working as a writer and editor for trade journals. To indulge his art-appreciation side, for a few years he blogged about music, covering specific years in American pop history. Switching gears, he chose Bowie as his new subject not because he felt like an expert or a completist on the man, but because he didn't. That is no longer the case. With the determination of an ultra-marathoner, O'Leary has written essays for every recording Bowie ever made. In early February, he will publish the second of his two-volume opus. At more than 700 pages, “Ashes to Ashes: The Songs of David Bowie, 1976-2016"" (Repeater Books) is a jumbo sequel to 2015's “Rebel Rebel,"" which covered Bowie's arrival from his first recording in 1964 (as Davie Jones) to the “Golden Years"" of his mid-'70s breakthrough in America. “Ashes to Ashes"" spans the 40 years from “Low"" to “Blackstar."" At 46, living with Lucy, his aging terrier, in a modest home in Easthampton, still earning his living editing white papers and writing about the legal and financial worlds, O'Leary could call himself the world's foremost authority on the most enigmatic recording artist of our time. But he probably wouldn't.  “I guess that's always been my thing,"" he says, sitting under a strand of Christmas lights in the living room where he keeps his books and records. “I'm the person not quite of the scene I write about."" For O'Leary, Bowie fit a need. He wanted a research subject with longevity, an artist who'd explored various styles and muses. The Who's Pete Townshend was on his shortlist, he says. He briefly considered Neil Young. But Bowie, who would have turned 72 next Tuesday — he died on Jan. 10, 2016, two days after his birthday — was the ultimate transformer. Whether you're a fan of his glam-era Ziggy Stardust persona or the big '80s pop of “Let's Dance,"" or if you loved his take on “Nature Boy"" for the “Moulin Rouge"" soundtrack, over the eventful course of his half-century career Bowie gave the world total access to his creative mind. As it happens, he provided one of his admirers with the project of a lifetime.  What began as a “writing exercise,"" as O'Leary acknowledges at the outset of “Ashes to Ashes,"" soon grew into an epic amalgam of logbook details, liner-notes minutiae, contextual analysis, critical commentary, and, occasionally, pure poetry.  “David Bowie today is a language,"" O'Leary writes, “a set of precepts and responses, a code that anyone with requisite amounts of style, guts, shamelessness, and weirdness can access.""  Bowie's own insatiable appetite for ideas — if you haven't already, do seek out his list of 100 favorite books — supplied O'Leary with a bonanza of material. Musically, “Ashes to Ashes"" spans the artist's infatuations with the city of Berlin, the MTV era, electronic drum and bass, and art song. Lyrically, the range of his inspirations is astounding. A single page of O'Leary's book includes references to Walt Whitman, George Orwell, and “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."" Bowie had effectively retired from the public eye when O'Leary launched his blog in 2009. For a time, it appeared to O'Leary that his blog, which he'd named “Pushing Ahead of the Dame"" (a line from Bowie's song “Queen Bitch""), would have to end with a satirical song. Bowie had come out of reclusion to serenade Ricky Gervais as “the little fat man"" in an episode of the comedian's mid-2000s HBO series “Extras."" Then Bowie stunned the world with his unannounced pair of “comeback"" albums, “The Next Day"" (2013) and the masterful “Blackstar"" (released on his 69th birthday in 2016). These coincided with the world tour of the museum exhibit “David Bowie Is"" and the stage production of Bowie's musical “Lazarus,"" which starred Michael C. Hall. O'Leary saw the show twice.  Bowie was fighting cancer as he worked on his last songs, though only a few intimates knew. The cast album for “Lazarus"" was recorded a day after his death. “That's a story I'd love to read,"" says O'Leary. “They did 'Lazarus' every night for two weeks after he died. Those must have been incredibly emotional performances. They were just doing a job, and suddenly they're on the frontlines, consoling people.""  The collective grief over Bowie's death, he writes, “may be among the last unified moments in global civilization."" On the anniversaries of Bowie's birth and death, O'Leary's interpretations of Bowie give us another chance to pay tribute. For his next act, he's thinking about Talking Heads, and how that band's career arc aligned with the gentrification of New York. For now, though, he says, “I feel like this is my last word.""  Bowie reportedly left behind five unheard demos. O'Leary wraps his project by asking whether they should see the light of day. He says no.  “Let this be our gift to the future,"" he writes. “There will never be a last David Bowie song if there are always five more to come. The end of the David Bowie story is that it doesn't end . . . May he forever keep pushing ahead.""  James Sullivan can be reached at jamesgsullivan@gmail.com. Follow him on Twitter @sullivanjames.

28,2176522685,"CAMBRIDGE — For almost 40 years, Marcelle Harrison's family has lived in a three-story light-gray home near Central Square. For a time, four generations slept under the same roof.  But when Harrison's stepfather and mother — Barbadian immigrants Noel and Richlene Aimes — died, neither left a will. And on the day before Thanksgiving, Harrison learned she stood to lose her longtime home to a group of relatives she barely knew. A letter from a state-appointed lawyer delivered the devastating news: Harrison, 64, was not the rightful heir to the home that her mother and stepfather had bought for $23,000 in 1980, now valued at more than $1 million.  Noel Aimes, who never learned to read and write, wanted the house to stay in the family, and in the 1990s proudly built additions to accommodate its growing numbers, Harrison said. But because he died two years after his wife and didn't name a beneficiary, state law allows his blood relatives — specifically his nieces and nephews in Barbados — to claim the house over a stepchild. “Since you were not an heir-at-law, your appointment is in jeopardy of being set aside,"" wrote Gayle Stone-Turesky, a Boston lawyer who was appointed by the state as a public administrator, who is brought in to handle estates where there is no will and no blood heir living in the state. A lawyer for Harrison's relatives said they are likely to sell the property once they seize control, an outcome that could lead to further gentrification of a neighborhood once known for its rich community of immigrant, working-class families.  It is a predicament that has outraged Harrison's neighbors, who have helped her hire a lawyer, accompanied her to court, and are contacting elected officials in hopes of finding a way the family can keep their home.  “We are sick about it,"" said Jean Cummings, 59, one of Harrison's longtime neighbors. “It's just so unjust.""  State Representative Michael Connolly, who lives across the street from Harrison, has reached out to Attorney General Maura Healey's office for advice.  “It shocks the conscience to think that this low-income, Barbadian family could be displaced, really out of the blue,"" Connolly said.  Ashburton Place is a narrow, dead-end street where neighbors help shovel each other out, share neighborhood gossip, and hold cookouts in the summer. The Harrisons have lived there the longest.  “We even let our dogs poop in each other's yards,"" said Nancy Ryan, one of Harrison's neighbors.  Harrison, meanwhile, is terrified and unsure of where her family, which includes her husband, a daughter, three granddaughters (one of whom is 3), and a nephew and his young family will live if they lose the home. “There is no word to describe what I'm feeling or what they've put me through,"" Harrison said. “I'm not sleeping, not eating. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to die in my sleep because I'm so stressed out."" The case hinges on a centuries-old law known as intestate, which generally favors blood relatives over relationships formed through time and mutual affection. Had Richlene Aimes died after her husband, the house would unquestionably belong to Harrison, said James Gardner Long III, Harrison's lawyer. But without a will, Harrison's status as a stepdaughter makes her essentially a stranger to Noel Aimes, whom she bathed and fed as he became more and more infirm from diabetes, he said.  “There are no feelings, no empathy in [the law],"" Long said. “It doesn't say you've put all this time and energy into the home. It just looks at the kinship chart."" Ilana Hurwitz, who teaches trust and estate law at Boston University School of Law, said Harrison's case is all too common, pointing to celebrities such as Prince and Aretha Franklin who died without wills, leaving relatives scrambling to figure out how to divide their fortunes. “For the most part, intestate succession is predicated on blood ties and not relationship,"" she said. “That may have heartbreaking consequences."" The relatives in Barbados are planning to sell the property, according to Hyman Darling, a Springfield lawyer who was first contacted by them. Darling said they learned about the property through an heir finder, a sort of online sleuth who tracks “lost"" estates for possible heirs in exchange for a fee. Darling declined to say when the relatives in Barbados first reached out to him, but he said the law makes Harrison's situation clear.  “She doesn't have the right to be there legally,"" Darling said. “The bottom line is she's a stepdaughter. Until the Commonwealth changes the law, the stepdaughter doesn't have any rights."" Darling also works as a public administrator, but because he's in Hampden County he referred the case to Stone-Turesky, a lawyer at Sugarman Rogers in Boston and one of five public administrators in Middlesex County.  Stone-Turesky, the sister of state Senator Cynthia Stone Creem, also a lawyer at Sugarman Rogers, did not return several e-mails and messages left at her office seeking comment.  Aimes's relatives in Barbados could not be reached for comment. Harrison said Noel Aimes was not particularly close to his siblings, except for one sister. A photo of the couple's wedding in Barbados shows Richlene Aimes's family, including Harrison, flanking the couple. Except for the sister, no one from Noel Aimes's side of the family attended the wedding, Harrison said. When the pair moved to Boston, Noel Aimes occasionally sent money to his sister but had little to no contact with the rest of his siblings, Harrison said. One niece came to Boston about a decade ago on her way to New York to get some cash from Noel Aimes, Harrison said.  Noel Aimes's sister died in 2001. It is her daughter, the niece who visited Boston once, as well as his remaining siblings and their children who are laying claim to the house, Harrison said.  Harrison said this isn't what her stepfather, who died in 2011 from complications of diabetes, would have wanted.  “He would be rolling"" in his grave, Harrison said. “Rolling."" Ryan, the neighbor, recalled how excited Noel Aimes was when he built the additions on his house. “He was building a home for his family,"" Ryan said. “That's what he lived for."" For Harrison, staying in the home permanently appears to be unlikely unless she can work out an arrangement with her stepfather's relatives or raise enough money to buy the property from them. Her neighbors are urging her to start a GoFundMe page. She has a strong case to be reimbursed at least for the taxes she paid on the property, any improvements she made to the house, and even her care of Noel Aimes in his final days, said Mary Clements Pajak, a partner at Pierce Atwood in Boston who specializes in probate and family law. “Depending on what that amount adds up to, it may give her leverage to exchange her services for the value of the home and keep the home instead of cash,"" said Pajak, who is not connected to the case.  Ryan said Stone-Turesky has agreed to meet with Harrison on Feb. 11. The hope is to work out a resolution that keeps Harrison on Ashburton Place, Ryan said. “I just want to stay in the house where I was living for 39 years,"" Harrison said. “That's all I want.""

1395,2194190626,"If Rosa Parks rode a Boston bus, she’d see similar segregation ► RAMOS Continued from PageAl that de facto segregation, by race and by income, does a lot of the same dirty work. If Rosa Parks boarded a bus in Boston today, she wouldn’t see black and white sections; she’d see a dysfunctional system system that is disproportionately failing the low-income people — largely people of color and immigrants — whose livelihoods livelihoods depend on it. Black riders spend 64 hours a year longer on MBTA buses than their white counterparts, according to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, a public agency charged with managing growth around Greater Boston. Even though white and minority minority riders use the bus system in roughly equal numbers, differences differences in reliability and frequency frequency of service on routes that serve mostly black and mostly white riders effectively steal more than a week and a half of work — 3 percent of a person’s annual productivity, skimmed right off the top. Meanwhile, many who can afford to avoid the bus have simply opted out. Nearly half of bus riders surveyed between 2015 and 2017 by the Metropolitan Metropolitan Planning Organization reported household income below below $58,000 a year. Another 17 percent declined to answer the question. These are people for whom a long delay on the T’s least reliable reliable service means risking a job, or paying for a taxi or Uber that they can barely afford. “It’s almost like you’re asking for a civil rights lawsuit. It’s like you’re begging for it,” said Maria Belen Power, associate executive director of the Chelsea-based environmental justice group GreenRoots. If you want to see how racism has moved from signs and slurs to systems and structures, a slow ride across the Tobin Bridge on a 111 bus packed with minority riders is a pretty good place to start.

Agyeman said Boston ought to do something much more dramatic in Parks’s name: Enact Enact a congestion charge on private private vehicles traveling to or from Boston, with the revenue going to improve transit, and bus service in particular. “A sticker is placation, right? ‘Raising awareness of T inequities is one of the many reasons why I thought this would be important.’ NATALIE ORNELL Braintree woman who led drive to honor Rosa Parks A sticker is the minimum you could possibly do without losing losing face,” Agyeman said. “We in Boston have never been about minimums.” But even getting state approval approval of the stickers wasn’t exactly exactly easy. Natalie Ornell, a Braintree woman who spearheaded the idea to honor Parks on buses here after noticing a similar program in Miami, spent months pushing to make it a reality. Ornell’s efforts to honor a hero have understandably been received as a feel-good story. But the truth is a little more complicated. “Raising awareness of T inequities inequities is one of the many reasons reasons why I thought this would be important for Massachusetts,” Massachusetts,” Ornell said by e-mail. “I hoped this would be a conversation conversation starter for people on all bus routes and I hoped it could create more engagement on these issues as people ride the bus and see her name, which is now permanent on the buses.” Parks should not be a simple reminder of how far we’ve come, but a living reminder of how far we are from equity. Just 8 percent of the T’s roughly 8,000 bus stops have shelters, according to a recent MBTA report. report. Only 19 of the T’s 176 bus routes offer frequent, all-day service. And 63 percent of area residents are not served by any of those 19 routes, which mostly mostly run along major corridors and feed big job centers like Longwood or Kendall Square. “I think there are a lot of ways to build a more equitable system — state investment in public transit that doesn’t unfairly unfairly burden poor people, that’s one key way,” said Lee Matsueda, political director for the advocacy group Alternatives Alternatives for Community & Environment. Environment. “If they believe in Rosa’s Rosa’s legacy, they’ve got to be a part of solutions like that, and stickers aren’t enough.” But stickers are what we’re stuck with, as long as lawmakers lawmakers and the governor decline to properly fund public transit. “At the end of the day, the MBTA does not have enough revenue to run either the service service we have or the service we want,” Paul Regan, executive director of the MBTA advisory board, said last year. When Rosa Parks died in 2005, the front seats of city buses in Montgomery and Detroit Detroit were reserved with black ribbons.

330,2188851146,"Art Review  HOWARDENA PINDELL: WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN  At the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, 415 South St., Waltham, through May 19. 781-736-3434, www.brandeis.edu/rose/ WALTHAM — It was a severe head injury, finally, that did it. By 1979, Howardena Pindell had carved out her own corner of the New York art world — no small feat, being a young black woman in a field all but owned by older white men, many by then basking in their own canonization. Then it happened: a car off the road, the injury, and, after a time languishing with short-term amnesia, a rough awakening. Pindell had treaded too lightly for too long, she decided, with her brilliant but restrained, finely made works. Her fractures were not just of her head, but of her soul, and the light now blazing through them told her what she had to do.  “What Remains to Be Seen,"" Pindell's 50-year career survey now at the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, cleaves her career neatly in two: before and after, injury and not. The two halves stare at each other across an architectural divide: The Rose's clean Modernist box of a gallery, built in 1961, is filled with Pindell's earlier paintings and drawings, most of them abstract, nearly all of them brimming with a restrained joy and careful precision. Its new annex, built in 2001, contains a gush of Pindell's boiling rage, intense swirls of image and text exploding with political complaint. Just eight months after the accident, her mind still swimming in the fog of memory loss, she made “Free, White and 21,"" a video piece in which she stares down the camera, bluntly recounting her struggles with racism and sexism in the art world. Then, lacquered in white face, Pindell chides her various complaints as trivial or imagined (“You must be really paranoid,"" her white alter ego says. “I've never had an experience like that, but of course I'm free, white and 21."") Clearly, there would be no going back.  The show spans a half-decade, but with racial tensions at full boil and gender inequity wobbling established orders all over, it seems made for this moment. Pindell's career is ply marked by both, and a show of her work in the here and now is a stark reminder of battles won, but a war long from over. It can feel like a show by two different artists, but the connective tissue is Pindell's determination to claim her own ground in a world made expressly not for her.  On either side of the divide, she's nothing less than heroic. Early works are demure subversion — playful, knowing, sensual, elegant. They fall in line with the thinking of the day: gestural painting, reduced, step by step, into minimal abstraction. Look closely, and you'll see Pindell making her own mark.  A grid undergirds many of her paintings, though their final forms are a gleeful upending of its rigid form — a scattering of color like so many leaves across its unforgiving structure. Thousands of tiny dots pile up in pieces like “Untitled"" (1971-72), evoking ideas of cosmic infinity and slavish pointillism all at once. Pindell has you looking for things that aren't there — a playful bait and switch, as she claims old painting territory for her own. Pindell, now 75, was keenly aware of significant art-world movements. She worked from 1967 to '79 on the curatorial staff at the Museum of Modern Art, the first black woman ever to do so. But she was also determined not to be kept in line by their strictures. She would write anonymous letters to the museum's director, decrying the lack of women and people of color on the museum's walls. (She would sign them “The Black Hornet."") In her own work, she coopted dominant art-world strategies of the day and chipped away at their priorities. She coated the surfaces of her big abstract paintings with talcum and glitter. She borrowed conceptual-art ideas of ordering and counting, cataloguing and numbering, and inflected them with irreverence, wonder, glee. One “Untitled"" piece is a scattering of small paper discs created with a hole punch, littering a surface like snow. Some are numbered, but with no possible purpose — a playful tease, as she willfully abandons order for chaos. A selection of small works are dense clusters of those same discs, bunched together in exuberantly entropic mounds, color-filled and sparkling.  Pindell's quiet revolution, and her infatuation with the circle, might have been seeded early. She grew up in Philadelphia, and on a childhood trip with her father, a mathematician, she saw the ugly side of America firsthand. Finishing her drink at a roadside stand in the Deep South, Pindell saw a big red dot on the glass's bottom. It was her first brush with segregation — glasses with dots were for blacks, those without for whites — and it would tinge her life with both frustration and purpose.  Subversion became her driving force, and her 1979 near-death experience shifted it from canny to overt. The plaintive tone of “Free, White and 21"" lies past the threshold from old building to new, before to after, but it invades the serenity of the previous galleries nonetheless, Pindell's edgy tone echoing through both. Past the screen you'll find her big jagged canvases, cut coarse and angular along their edges; some are torn through the middle and sutured roughly back together. They carry violent ideas, subjected to violence themselves.  Many share the title “Autobiography,"" signaling that Pindell is done with her critique from a safe conceptual remove. “Autobiography: Water (Ancestors/Middle Passage/Family Ghosts),"" from 1988, is a chaotic bricolage of text and image, an obscure figure with Pindell's face laid prone in the middle. With a surface laid thick with swatches of blue paint — a roiling sea, which brought generations of slaves from Africa to America — the piece boils with unrest, though Pindell leaves nothing to chance. A patch of text swims in a field of brilliant blue: It's an excerpt from the North Carolina slave codes — what an owner was permitted, by law, to do to a slave who had defied him.  It's tempting to see Pindell's accident as a clean break — a departure point, a split. But the show does well to draw a continuum — ruptured, surely, but still intact. Pindell was never quietly following in line; her early works are quietly radical, cheeky, cooptive, a rigorous and playful tease. She declared herself softly, and the works have the subtle beauty of oblique defiance. The injury may have helped send Pindell into the most fractious debates of her time: Works here address the AIDS crisis of the '80s, the hellbent gentrification of New York and the resulting homelessness epidemic, police brutality, and the Gulf War. But her priorities hardly wavered. For all its dizzying breadth, her work is consistent: She was always chipping away at the abuse of power, by however radically different means.  Coming to the end, then, feels like arriving full circle, if you'll pardon the pun. Her latest works here are from 2016 — big, spiraling canvases cut and resewn in the form of a rough nautilus shell, shimmering with glitter and those hole-punched dots. The form suggests a continuum — a symbol of endurance, but also renewal and expansion, the creature at its core regenerating chamber after chamber in a widening gyre.  I think that's what Pindell would like for us to take away from the show — not that the world is a dark and desperate place, but that things evolve and change, in whatever small increments. Coming through her political screeds and furtive cries to arrive here, at beauty again, feels like something more radical. It feels, dare I say it, like hope.

73,2245723510,"At the national level, top-tier Democratic candidates for president have espoused some of the most liberal campaign platforms in decades. And in Boston, officials have pushed for unprecedented progressive initiatives — from charging fees for car usage to massive tax hikes on high-end real estate deals. And what of Martin J. Walsh, the second-term mayor? He's listening, he said. Things don't happen overnight. But he wants to collaborate. “We want to continue to push the agenda, and continue to have our agenda pushed by people,"" Walsh said in a recent interview. Roughly 19 months after voters gave him a commanding reelection win, though, the mayor has, in many ways, lingered in the quiet middle as members of his party and other city leaders have loudly moved left, according to a Globe review of Walsh's initiatives.  At a time when the City Council has been its most aggressive in recent history, Walsh has played catch-up in policy areas ranging from the environment to transportation and education. Amid a booming economy, the administration has the day-to-day operations of city government in check: Crime is historically low, parks are clean. On housing, Walsh is on track with his ambitious goal to build 70,000 new units to contain prices, one of the most pressing and intractable problems in Boston. And the mayor has taken some dramatic stands in response to President Trump, as in 2017, when he vowed to use City Hall as a shelter to protect immigrants who are “targeted unjustly"" by the administration. But Walsh has been slow to take bold steps, if he is willing to take them at all, when it comes to addressing other significant problems confronting the city. One of the mayor's top policy initiatives, for instance, funding universal high-quality pre-kindergarten, was announced in early April — six years after Walsh named it a priority in his first mayoral campaign. Meantime, New York City and Philadelphia have implemented universal pre-kindergarten; Walsh says it will take up to five years before the program goes into full effect in Boston. There have been hesitations on public safety, with the delay in implementing police body cameras. (About 200 officers started using them this month.) The mayor has pulled back on efforts for education reforms, such as changing school start times, and the city only recently named a new superintendent following a nine-month search that was criticized for its slow pace. On the environment, the mayor established a Green Ribbon Commission in 2016 that this year recommended initiatives for the city to meet its goals of going carbon-neutral by 2050. The mayor balked at some of the recommendations, such as imposing congestion fees. And on transportation, traffic has consumed parts of Greater Boston, with no urgent answer from the city.  One telling example: Councilor Michelle Wu recently called for the city to charge fees for residential parking stickers, as a means to tackle the traffic that paralyzes the city each day. Wu said paid permits could motivate residents to “think about their car usage and their parking decisions differently . . . it all has to be on the table."" Walsh quickly dismissed the idea, calling it an ineffective additional tax, and said city government has minimal power to control traffic, anyway. “How could a mayor have a plan, where would you find that? Seriously, tell me where?"" he asked the Globe editorial board in April. “People will have cars. What am I supposed to do, stop them? This is a tough issue, I know it is. We're in the midst of one of the best economic booms in the history of our city, and unfortunately one of the downfalls to that is traffic, and I don't know what the plan can be."" The mayor argued that he had already increased parking meter rates, which he said is a proven way to reduce congestion. Otherwise, he said, his efforts have been more focused on changing the culture of transportation in the city, by encouraging residents to ride bikes and pursuing efforts to improve transit safety.  But Boston has been behind Everett in looking at expanding the MBTA's rapid bus transit. And the mayor was among the last to speak out against controversial MBTA fare hikes that will take effect this summer.  Only this past week, after another MBTA train derailment brought the Red Line to a halt, did the mayor cite the “point of urgency"" for reforms and investments, including, potentially, raising revenue locally to improve train service. Meanwhile, councilors have spearheaded and passed some of the city's most ground-breaking initiatives, such as regulating short-term rentals, to help confront the housing crisis. The mayor's proposal for municipal lobbying reform went nowhere, and the council ultimately passed its own version; more than 200 lobbyists have since registered with the city.  While the council has always had at least one vocal member willing to push the mayor from the left, this group, at least compared to its predecessors, has been more successful in carrying out such an agenda. “We recognize we have the ability to step up a little bit more when it comes to leadership,"" said the council's president, Andrea Campbell, noting the council has been responding to voters' demands to be bold in light of the tumult in national politics. “You're seeing us being bold and courageous, even if we're the ones taking the first step."" Councilors were the first to propose the city's wetlands protection ordinance, which could become law this year, and they've pushed for programs such as curbside composting and carbon-neutral construction — initiatives the mayor said he will now consider. Walsh recently approved a community choice energy package, allowing local account-holders to purchase green energy. But the council had been pushing it since 2017. Last year, a ban on single-use plastic bags went into effect in Boston — an initiative led by Councilor Matt O'Malley — after the mayor begrudgingly signed it into law, citing concerns about its cost.  Following the legalization of marijuana, the city has yet to develop a comprehensive social-equity system in a burgeoning industry. And a recent review of $646 million in city contracts found that fewer than 1 percent went to minority or women-owned businesses. Again, it was the council that pushed to make that data public. In an interview, Walsh recognized the electorate's calls for leaders to be more bold, saying people are fed up with government in a time of national unrest. “I think there are people pushing us that we're not going far enough, and I agree and I appreciate that as well,"" he said. But he also stressed the complexity of running Boston's government, saying the city is hamstrung in what it can do in many ways: a lack of federal funding and policy support from the Trump administration; a state system that requires legislators to approve many local laws; no authority over the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Anyone can propose a policy. Effecting change as mayor is different, he said. “We all want instant gratification. . . . On anything we want, we want it today. I want it today,"" he said. “But you only have so much to expend upon it, and there are so many other aspects of government."" Some advocates said the mayor can still do more, arguing that the administration could capitalize on a pivotal movement in Boston politics in which people are calling for change, and lead the calls for reform. Jesse Mermell, president of the Alliance for Business Leadership, said the mayor has begun to make substantive progress on transportation, but added, “I dream of what could happen if he doubles down."" She said, for instance, that other places, such as Seattle and the Washington, D.C., region, have led the way in improving their transportation systems. “He has the bully pulpit of the mayor's office . . . he has a ton of influence with the [state] administration, the business community, with other stakeholders,"" she said. “We're all saying transportation is a crisis and we need to do something. Shame on all of us if we don't seize that moment and do something big and bold."" Others added that the administration could do more on environmental matters — an issue Walsh has called a priority in his second term. Deb Pasternak, chapter director for the Massachusetts Sierra Club, said the city has laid out plans, such as the Carbon Free Boston report, but officials need to start taking action on those plans. She called on the city to do more to promote carbon-neutral building. “It requires bold steps now, and the mayor is yet to start implementing them,"" she said. Walsh said his administration has pushed in areas where it can, setting realistic goals. The mayor has proposed a plan to protect the city's shores from the effects of climate change. That includes elevating roads in vulnerable neighborhoods, encouraging green development, and expanding parks so they can absorb rising waters; he pointed to the new Martin's Park and plans for Moakley Park as examples. But the plans also need outside funding and cooperation from the private sector. Affordable housing, the gentrification of neighborhoods, and the displacement of residents remain citywide concerns, even as Boston experiences its greatest building boom. Several advocates, such as Mermell, praised Walsh for his effort to address a crisis that preceded his administration, for instance by calling for a partnership with surrounding municipalities to create a regional approach to the housing shortage. The mayor has accelerated the development of nearly 70,000 housing units in Boston, including about 20,000 for low-income families. And still, councilors have gone further, pushing to tax high-end real estate deals and urging the city to demand more in mitigation payments from developers. The result is an administration that, analysts say, has failed to secure big, defining victories in any one policy arena but, by the mayor's own admission, has instead been built on fine-tuning the general mechanics of city government, while riding the tailwinds of a booming economy. Political observers say that Boston voters demand more, and they made their feelings known at the ballot box last year. In Jamaica Plain, Nika Elugardo ousted a veteran state representative, Jeffrey Sánchez, the highest-ranking Latino in the Legislature and a Walsh-backed candidate, by running to his left on issues such as immigration.  Most notably, Ayanna Pressley staged the state's political upset of the year by defeating longtime congressman Michael E. Capuano, who also had Walsh's support. Pressley, the first black woman from Massachusetts elected to Congress, ran under the slogan “Change can't wait."" Maurice Cunningham, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said the city's electorate has been moving to the left at a time that Walsh has been trying to build relations with Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican. That could backfire: Baker, for instance, has proposed significant changes to the education funding formula that sharply differ from Walsh's plans, and wouldn't really benefit the city at all. “I think it raises questions, maybe ones harmful to [Walsh's] ambitions,"" Cunningham said, noting questions about Walsh's aspirations for higher office, including governor. “He doesn't have to follow the left crowd, but he has to show leadership on these issues; these are issues that are concerning Democratic activists in the state."" Walsh welcomed the push from advocates and the councilors, saying he tries to work with them. He argued that his predecessors were equally criticized for not collaborating enough. “Legislative branches should work like that,"" he said. “We may not necessarily agree on all the things that are filed. . . . But that's good government. That's about conversations."" As mayor, Walsh said, his duty has been to build consensus in all corners of the city. He called Boston a leader in certain arenas, including addressing homelessness and promoting gender equality. He argued that what the city has been able to do so far to address climate change and the housing crisis has made Boston a national model, even if he acknowledges the city needs to do more. In the meantime, Walsh's other second-term proposals included building more schools (the Dearborn was completed, Boston Arts Academy is under construction, and the Eliot is being expanded); raising more funding to address homelessness and to help city students pay for college (a multiyear plan); and rebuilding the bridge to Long Island (it's been funded and set in motion, though it's been snagged in the permitting process amid opposition from Quincy). His initiatives may not always be “sexy, and don't get headlines,"" he said, but he described them as essential to good government. “Different people have different concerns and understanding on how we move forward,"" Walsh said, referring to disparate visions for the city's future. “But at the end of the day, it's one big visionary plan on how we move forward.""

404,2297178217,"Inbox Planned high-rise is an ill fit for Chinatown, Leather District The proposed office tower for 125 Lincoln St. is another example example of development that is not in synch with neighborhood neighborhood needs (“24-floor tower plan stirs protest,” Business, Aug. 13). The 340-foot tower will isolate two historical Boston Boston neighborhoods from each other and bring more workers workers seeking to live nearby, further accelerating the gentrification gentrification of Chinatown and the Leather District. TSNE Mission Works owns and operates the Nonprofit Center at 89 South St., around the corner from the proposed proposed tower. We bought this building in 2004 to serve as an anchor for nonprofits by providing below-market, accessible accessible downtown space for the nonprofit community. And, as recent Globe articles point out, real estate market pressures make it virtually impossible for nonprofits to stay in the Back Bay, South End, and downtown areas. This pushes nonprofits farther away from transportation hubs, is a barrier barrier for recruiting and retaining young, diverse talent into the sector, and forces constituents to travel longer to access services. It’s another consequence of gentrification, and another another indicator of the lack of equity in our city’s urban development development policies. Instead, Boston needs to honor its commitment to all its residents, and use this parcel to build affordable housing, community retail, and community-based programming space at 125 Lincoln St. ELAINE NG CEO TSNE MissionWorks Boston Splitting mental health from the rest of care is a costly policy mistake James W. Hunt Jr.’s Aug. 9 letter (“Community health centers centers offer a model of how to fix ailing US system”) is important, important, but it leaves out a major aspect of health care that is costing the taxpayer and government needless dollars. The history of separating mental health from the rest of health care (known as a carve-out) is responsible for the lack of integration integration of mind and body into a coherent approach to the health and illness of the population. About 50 percent of Americans will have a mental health problem during their lifetime, and by some estimates, estimates, half of primary care visits are related to mental health or substance use disorders. Our government splits mental health from medical care (with a separate Department of Mental Health and Department Department of Public Health), decreasing the effectiveness of care, and increasing costs. Pharmacy management companies and vendors for mental health that is paid for by Medicaid skim profits off the top of federal, state, and private insurance insurance dollars that could otherwise be spent on prevention and treatment. The same edition of the Globe depicts payment for a severe severe childhood disorder that costs millions (“Life-changing treatment, heartbreaking choices,” Page Al), while mental health care is the only industry in the United States expected expected to operate at a continual loss. Without significant changes, changes, we will fail to provide effective, cost-containing care over the long run. Yearly budgets do not address the total cost of care over a lifetime. Only early investment of prevention, prevention, assessment, and treatment, and a significant, functioning continuum of care, can reduce total medical expenses. expenses.

MARSHALL FORSTEIN Acting chair of psychiatry Cambridge Health Alliance Cambridge Argument against D.C. statehood is a vote for oppression Re “There is no good case for D.C. statehood” (Opinion, Aug. 11): As a resident of the District of Columbia who is living in Massachusetts, I found Jeff Jacoby’s column to be offensive and tone-deaf. First, the idea that people should simply leave the District if they are upset about disenfranchisement disenfranchisement ignores those low-income residents for whom moving is simply not an option. On top of that, why should those who are disenfranchised resort to uprooting their lives to appease the very system that oppresses them? Second, Jacoby apparently does not know the fraught history of the District, and how its abortion clinics, needle exchange programs, and gun laws have been eviscerated by Congress over the years. “Taxation Without Representation” Representation” isn’t just a catchy slogan; it’s a reminder that the values values we’ve fought for since the Revolution aren’t realized. The last time we checked, favorable Gallup polls, square mileage, and population density are not requirements for statehood. The truth is, arguments like these are just a glaring glaring reminder that there will always be those willing to justify justify injustice.

Yes, there will be the predictable wailing about paying a public official for doing nothing — something Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants anticipated in writing for the court’s majority. He called the court’s reversal on the pay issue “the best of the bad alternatives under these circumstances.” But most pointedly he also wrote, “A suspension without pay may do more than burden an individual judge. “In turbulent times, the risk of being stripped of a paycheck may have a chilling effect on a judge’s willingness to challenge the conduct of a prosecutor and thereby diminish the over-all independence of - the judiciary, even if the judge were confident that he or she ultimately would prevail at trial if the prosecutor were to bring criminal charges against him or her.” And these are indeed turbulent times. No doubt about it. Joseph was indicted on federal obstruction-of-justice charges in April for allegedly conspiring to allow a Dominican national to walk out a back door of the courthouse and thus avoid being detained by an ICE agent waiting in the courthouse with a civil order. Often judges who are suspended because of an internal disciplinary action don’t get paid, and following the usual playbook, the SJC ordered Shelley suspended without pay following her indictment. She remains suspended from the bench, but this week the court reinstated her $184,000 a year salary. If the high court seemed a The SJC saw that more than a judge’s financial security was at stake. SCOT LEHIGH Elizabeth Warren is a hit in N.H. H FRANCONIA, N.H. ollywood wag Oscar Levant, poking fan at what he considered her made-forpublic made-forpublic consumption image, once quipped that “I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin.” Levant’s impish line came to mind as I watched Elizabeth Warren campaign in the peaks of New Hampshire. Here’s why: I covered her before she was an Okie. By that, I mean before mothers became mommas, fathers became daddies, infants became babies, and dolls “dollies.” And before she asked her audience if there were other “Okies” in attendance. By the end of her open-air town hall meeting Wednesday, I half expected her to belt out “Oh What A Beautiful Mornin.’ ” That said, serving up country corn pone is a minor matter compared with falsely claiming to have made oneself a billionaire with the help of a small $1 million family loan, as a certain president whose father actually channeled him hundreds of millions of dollars has done. And though I winced at the hokey Okieness, Okieness, it didn’t seem to bother the crowd of 500 or more who came to the majestic mountains of Bode Miller country to hear the liberal populist. No indeed. Warren was a certified hit. She is corralling positive populist energy by running as pro-government but anti-Washington. That is, she is for more government services, but against a capital in the grips of big money, big oil, big pharma, big corporations, big finance, big shots, and big favors. And, based on my conversations, she is steadily assuaging doubts and gaining converts. Among its other race-shaping dynamics, the New Hampshire primary will be a key contest between dueling New England neighbors Warren and Bernie Sanders, the two high-profile same-lane lefties. The winner winner will leave with progressive bragging rights, the loser likely find him or herself stuck on, with apologies to nearby Cannon Mountain, a Hardscrabble downward trail. My sampling of opinions in this wellheeled wellheeled older crowd left me with the distinct, though anecdotal, impression that Warren is on the move, while Sanders is stuck. William Briggeman, a retired educator from nearby Twin Mountain, backed Bernie Bernie in 2016, but now thinks the Vermont senator “missed his moment” and that Donald Trump could launch devastating attacks on him because of his embrace of Democratic socialism. “I think she could handle Trump,” he said of Warren. “She is a first-class debater.” Jim Shuchman, a Democrat and retired attorney from Littleton who is torn between between Sanders and Warren, judged the Massachusetts senator “very impressive.” He left the event thinking that her legal experience experience — strange as it may seem to those who know her only as an Okie from well west of Muskogee, she has taught at Harvard Harvard — has made her better equipped to strengthen the rule of law, a concern sparked by the Trump years. His wife, Barb, said her group of friends had reluctantly supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, though their hearts were really little flummoxed, well, who could blame them? The case is — to the best of anyone’s knowledge — totally without precedent. This wasn’t the kind of indictment, after ah, that had anything to do with financial irregularities in office or even the hint of misconduct for personal gain — about which there is some case law, and for which an unpaid suspension makes more sense. Of course, had US Attorney Andrew Lehing not opted to handle the matter with a gross overreach of prosecutorial authority, the merits of the case might well have been decided by the state’s Judicial Conduct Commission, leaving the SJC to follow up with an appropriate punishment, if warranted. That’s exactly the course Justice Scott Kafker alluded to in his concurring opinion: “Because judges are held to the highest standards of conduct, especially in the court room, a Commission on Judicial Conduct investigation still may result in a recommendation for particular discipline, which could include sanctions from reprimand to indefinite suspension without pay.” But that’s a far different matter than bowing to the apparent need of a federal prosecutor to score political points and make an example of a rookie district court judge. The indictment of Joseph and the now retired chief court officer in Newton District Court was clearly designed to have a chilling effect on the state’s entire judiciary — something the SJC’s majority seems to have belatedly realized in this latest ruling. Justice Frank Gaziano noted in his dissent that the court was treating Joseph “more favorably than ah other employees of the Trial Court.” That’s true. But it’s also true the Massachusetts Constitution was among the first documents in this country to recognize that judges are different, that their independence is indeed “essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and character.” Andrew Lehing may be in denial about that, but this week the SJC showed it is not. with Sanders. This time around, however, her group wasn’t torn. They are Warrenites, Warrenites, she said. Similarly, Katharine Terrie, 75, of Littleton, Littleton, reported that friends of hers who were “rabid” for Sanders in 2016 aren’t there this time because of concerns about his age and electability. Elise Drake, 67, a financial analyst from Franconia and a moderate, said she liked both Warren and Pete Buttigieg. Still, she had gone to see Sanders recently in nearby Littleton. Her judgment: Warren was better better organized in New Hampshire, while Sanders’ campaign “is running out of gas.” Yet despite generally favorable impressions impressions of Warren, there were some concerns over her embrace of single-payer health care. Briggeman volunteered that he was “a little worried” about that because, though a Medicare recipient himself, “there are lots of people who don’t want to give up private insurance.” He had hoped to ask Warren what she would tell them to win their votes; though he didn’t have a chance on Wednesday, Wednesday, he has e-mailed her that question. “I think that is a mistake,” agreed Terrie, who, as a grant-writer, has expertise in expanding expanding access to health care in rural areas. Abetter approach, she said, would be to lower the age of Medicare eligibility to 50. When voters in your wheelhouse have those worries, it’s best to take heed, Senator Senator Warren.

1367,2312897382,"O n a summer afternoon, vacationers fill the parking lot nestled between the dunes at Chapin Beach in Dennis. They unload beach chairs and plunge umbrellas into powdery sand, their children splashing across acres of bayside shallows and sandbars sandbars exposed by low tide. Unless they’ve seen what winter brings, they would not realize that the road they traveled to get here was so close to ruin. The only clues along Dr. Bottero Road are a handful of highway-orange construction barrels and a web of cracks in the asphalt — remnants of winter storms that erode the earth right out from under the roadway, the blacktop cracking and collapsing. “It just sticks right out there and says, ‘Erode me. Hit me with your waves,’” said Karen Johnson, natural resources director for the town of Dennis. “We go into every winter saying, Ts Dr. Bottero going to make it?”’ Often, it doesn’t. Over the course of Johnson’s nine years on the job, Chapin Beach has lost about 30 feet to erosion. There are places like this all over the Cape — homes, streets, whole neighborhoods — that exist perilously close to catastrophe. And in every town, there are people like Johnson working to save them. Confoundingly, the threats are not just the storms and rising seas and increased rates of erosion brought by climate change, but the human reaction reaction to it. Along the bay west of Chapin Beach, each new stone sea wall or rocky protrusion jutting into the ocean helps to preserve one piece of property by collecting eroding sand. But each one also prevents that sand from traveling to the beach downstream. The solution in one place exacerbates the problem in another. The projects proceed, property by property, pushing the problem downstream, each preserving a small part of the Cape by ruining it, just a little bit, until there’s no beach left. “I don’t know what Cape Cod is without beaches,” said Andrew Gottlieb, Gottlieb, director of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod. “Living on a Cape without beaches is kind of an unimaginable thing. Why would you do that?” This shortsightedness about climate change is hardly unique to the Cape. It is a global failing of unmistakable consequence, here and almost everywhere. N othing about preserving the essence of the Cape will be easy. The sandy shores of the Cape’s coastline are inherently malleable, shifting in response to storms and sea level rise. The roads and neighborhoods and buildings? Not so much. In all, about 20 percent of the Cape is now within the special flood hazard area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That represents more than $29 billion in property, including over 1,500 historic structures. The state, local Cape governments, and conservation groups have all poured time and money into protecting the coastline and the environment environment from the effects of climate change. Millions of dollars in grants, working groups packed with national experts, and voluminous, detailed reports have made Massachusetts a national leader in the field. One recent example: Through its Resilient Cape Cod project, funded by a $780,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Administration, the Cape Cod Commission, the regional planning and regulatory regulatory agency on the Cape, has identified dozens of strategies to protect the Cape’s coasts from the rising seas and major storms. These include open space requirements that allow natural land to migrate inland; building dunes and marshes and something called living shorelines, which combine such minor hard barriers as low rock walls with natural wetlands; incentives to help homeowners move their houses out of harm’s way — a process known as retreat. But getting through to the public and persuading property owners to take heed has proved to be difficult. “People are resistant to that ‘retreat’ word,” said Kristy Senatori, the commission’s executive director. “They prefer to fortify instead. They prefer the short-term solutions like putting sand on a beach.” So much is threatened here that some 8,000 homes were added to the flood plain in 2014, the last time the federal government updated its maps. Flood-proofing homes can be both complicated and expensive, said Shannon Jarbeau, a flood plain manager who works with communities communities all over the Cape to enforce building codes that help drive down flood insurance rates, which now average about $2,000 a year. Such costs are sure to accelerate a trend which already threatens something that makes the Cape special, compared to its island neighbors neighbors — economic diversity, the working class and the well-to-do mingling mingling where sand meets sea. “There’s a significant potential,” Jarbeau said, “for gentrification of the coast.” the clams can’t sustain themselves. Their tiny shells open and drift away. “In the fall, they were beautiful, healthy quahogs,” Doane said. “Three or four months later, here we are.” That makes the future of the shellfish industry a little murky on Cape Cod, where Dave Fontaine and the other shuckers at the Beachcomber in Wellfleet will bang through 1,200 or so oysters a day. For now, Doane said, most of the oysters on raw bars on the Cape are local; shellfish destined for the fryer are usually trucked in from the Chesapeake Bay. When A.R.C. was founded 60 years ago, aquaculture was envisioned as a way to create cheap protein to help solve world hunger. Today, Massachusetts shellfish — what’s left of them — are too valuable valuable to shuck and fry. FORTIFY AND RETREAT O ne day in June, a cement mixer rolled into the parking lot at Herring Herring Cove Beach in Provincetown, preparing to pour a pad for a new emergency phone: Dial in case of sharks. The presence of great white sharks in the waters around the Cape, lured by a booming seal population, has fundamentally changed the way people interact with the beaches here. Walk onto any public beach on the Cape and you’ll pass a menacing sign warning that something deadly could be lurking not too far off shore. But the more existential danger is the water itself. Along Herring Cove, a patchwork of flimsy wooden fencing bigger than a football field extends down the beach here, designed to catch sand and encourage a dune system to rebuild. Native grasses are planted in perfect rows like crops. A new, freshly paved parking lot is behind the fledgling dunes. As the sea rises and erosion does its steady work, this is what retreat looks like: A new parking lot, built about 200 feet inland from the old. A bath house built on pilings so it can be scooped up and moved again in a few decades. Dunes were coaxed back to life. The effort cost about $3 million and is decidedly temporary, said Mark Adams, a coastal geographer at the National Seashore. There were other options, none of them perfect. A rock wall might have lasted a bit longer, but pretty soon you’d lose the beach. The ocean does not negotiate. A few feet out in the shallows, a cockeyed concrete piling protrudes from the water: This used to be a road. A seal bobbed by as if out for a stroll. The strategic retreat at Herring Cove is a model for how things could go elsewhere on the Cape and around the world, said Adams. It does minimal damage to the surrounding area, preserves public access to a place people love. It also leaves decisions about what to do when the water water threatens the parking lot again to the next generation of residents. Like so much around here, it won’t last. WHEN THE BIG ONE COMES T o lay eyes upon what happened in Provincetown two winters ago — and to glimpse what will surely happen again — begin in the basement of Jerry Swartz’s Commercial Street liquor store, where the water crashed through a bulkhead door and filled the basement. Today, the dried detritus of January 2018’s storm still lines the pipes that criss-cross overhead in the darkened stockroom. A single sea gull feather the length of a toddler’s finger is wedged in a fitting at the bottom of the stairs. “I was in the Coast Guard. I’ve seen what water can do to the hull of a ship. But this was something else,” Swartz said. “We’ve had trickles ... but never enough that the water came down the stairwell.” The water rushed down Commercial Street, crashing into the art galleries galleries and bars, bed & breakfasts that are packed densely into the town’s tourist center. The January storm badly damaged Julie Heller’s art gallery on the beach, her iconic sign — the word ART spelled out with seaweed — protruding protruding incongruously from the flood waters. The handmade windows and doors buckled. “It had never flooded there, ever,” Heller said. “I didn’t have business insurance because it had never flooded, and it was off season.” More than a year later, weeds grew up and through her husband’s old sports car, still parked in the sand. And all those paintings were still in storage. Nearby, the old Unitarian Universalist Meeting House, built in 1826 on the far side of Commercial Street from the ocean had seemed secure. But flood pathways can be counter-intuitive: When the water arrived, it came first from the back door, which faces away from the beach. Even after the storm, the water stubbornly refused to recede. When someone hoisted up the bulkhead in the boiler room behind the downstairs downstairs hall, they found tiny fish swimming just below the floor. The problems didn’t stop when the water receded. One day, the pasPeople pasPeople walked along the Sandwich Boardwalk. First built in the 19 th century, the boardwalk has been damaged and rebuilt multiple times.

Noe, as everyone calls him, has lost his faith and left the seminary where he was training for the priesthood. He can’t stay home in Dublin with his father, father, unreachable since the recent death of Noe’s mother, so he goes to visit his grandparents in Faha. Noe was sent there often during his mother’s mother’s grim 10-year decline. “Each time I came to Faha I found it smaller and poorer,” he says, but “the sense of it as a place of escape endured.” Ganga, Noe’s cheerfully dreamy grandfather, and Doady, his dour, pragmatic grandmother, grandmother, are among the vivid character sketches abounding in “This Is HappiSenate HappiSenate history as seen from ‘Desk 88’ ► “DESK 88” Continued from Page N12 “Progressives of all generations, and certainly those who sat at Desk 88, share a revulsion at injustice and wage inequality and wealth disparity” he writes, adding that “most progressives progressives are bound together by a deep respect respect for the dignity of work and ... typically share a common suspicion of concentrated power, especially private private power.” His seat predecessors are a pantheon pantheon of progressives, some (RFK, George McGovern) still well-known today; some (Albert Gore Sr., William Proxmire, Abraham Ribicoff) remembered remembered only by the most aged Americans, Americans, some (Hugo Black, Herbert Lehman) Lehman) formidable figures of history, and some (Theodore Francis Green, Glen Taylor) forgotten.

1247,2339525784,"The recent elections for the Boston City Council focused on the high price of housing in the city. The median price of a single-family home has risen more than 75 percent over a decade and now stands at $615,000. This is nearly triple the nationwide median price of $225,000. Median rents in Boston have also soared, going up 60 percent in 10 years. This has led to renewed focus on rent control as a solution to the housing crisis. A move to rent control in Boston would follow in the footsteps of recent rent control initiatives in California, Oregon, and New York City. While housing costs in Boston are a problem, rent control is not the answer. Economics research shows that rent control will benefit some renters already in place, but will lead to a reduced supply of housing that will ultimately make housing less available for Bostonians — and less fairly distributed. Perhaps the best example of the problems with rent control come from the experience of San Francisco. In 1994, the city expanded its rent control program to include a set of buildings that had been excluded based on size of the building and year of construction — but left other similar nearby buildings to be priced under the free market. This law had the intended effect of reducing the exit of existing tenants from the newly rent- controlled properties. But the unintended consequences were costly. Landlords of the newly rent-controlled properties responded by removing them in large numbers from the rental market through condo conversation and other redevelopment. Over time, the result was a dramatic 15 percent reduction in the rental supply of small multi-family housing — which led to higher rents over the entire city. Moreover, since many of the rental properties were converted to higher-end owner- occupied condos, the housing stock became more elitist — further creating barriers to a thriving middle class in the city. Taken together, rent control increased, rather than decreased, the gentrification of San Francisco.  Looking at the Bay Area today, it's clear rent control does little to help low- or middle-income families. The residents of these rent-controlled units had 8 percent higher income than those in noncontrolled housing. They were also 60 percent less likely to be a minority. So if rent control doesn't solve the problem, what does? The answer, unfortunately, is the one that economists have pointed to repeatedly for decades: reduce regulatory barriers to increasing the supply of housing and lowering prices. For example, a common restriction used in the Greater Boston area is minimum lot sizes — sometimes of an acre or more. One recent study found that imposing a minimum lot size of an acre per housing unit lowered new construction by 50 percent and increased housing prices by 12 percent. This is the effect of just a single type of regulation, of which there are many. Research collecting and aggregating all these complex policies into a single index to compare across cities shows that Greater Boston is the second most land-use regulated housing market in the country. Easing these restrictions to allow more new housing supply is the key solution to the housing affordability problem. If the solution is that simple, why hasn't it happened already? One possible answer is also quite simple: Existing residents of neighborhoods are usually opposed. A concern we often hear is that more supply will raise the prices that residents pay for housing through gentrification. Of course this is not consistent with economic theory or evidence. Indeed, most of the evidence shows that adding new developments lowers surrounding housing prices — and certainly lowers the total cost of housing in the city. But these concerns persist, and they place repeated barriers to new development. So we suggest not just relying on economic evidence but putting in place an explicit mechanism to protect existing renters from the risk of a “gentrification premium"": rental insurance. Under such a plan, neighbors around a new development would receive a monthly check from the government that compensates them partially for the rise in rents in their neighborhood above expectation. This check would be targeted to low- and middle-income families to ensure that housing policy changes aren't just furthering gentrification. Families could use this check to offset the higher neighborhood rents or could use it to compensate them for moving elsewhere. Either way, families are protected from the potentially higher costs of living in their neighborhood — without creating incentives for individuals to stay in place and for landlords to remove property from the rental pool. To solve the problem of high housing prices in Boston, we need more supply. But this means creative solutions that can help smooth the way to removing barriers to supply. Rental insurance could be part of the solution.  Rebecca Diamond is associate professor of economics at Stanford University.

356,2354603191,"The number of homeless students enrolled in Massachusetts has increased, according to a new report by the National Center for Homeless Education. The student homeless population in the state's public school districts rose by more than 3,000 between 2016 and 2018 to more than 23,000. The report defines homeless as students who lack a fixed and adequate home, including those living in shared housing, motels or trailers, and cars, public spaces, or abandoned buildings. “We're counting the real universe,"" said Kate Barrand, CEO of Horizons for Homeless Children, a nonprofit group. “We see about 3,000 children in Massachusetts right now, on any given night, in shelters. That's all that fits in the emergency assistance rooms. That doesn't mean that's all of the homeless."" Sarah Slautterback, state coordinator for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth program, said the increase stems in part from more accurate and consistent reporting but also reflects the scarcity and high cost of housing in Massachusetts. “It's a clear indicator that there's not enough housing around,"" she said. “Our families on low income and fixed income are not able to keep up."" Barrand also cited the area's high cost of living as a leading factor behind the increase. “We see gentrification of neighborhoods that used to be more affordable and suddenly we see million-dollar condos going in,"" she said, citing developments in traditionally lower-income neighborhoods such as Jamaica Plain and Roxbury. Slautterback said the increase also coincides with a surge of Puerto Rican students enrolling in Massachusetts schools after Hurricane Maria in 2017. Most of the students were counted as homeless, she said. The National Center for Homeless Education collects data on the demographics and academic performance of homeless students through state submissions to the US Department of Education. Nationally, more than 1.5 million students were reported as experiencing homelessness at some point during the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 school years. In those years, the number of students experiencing homelessness increased by 15 percent. In Massachusetts, Boston, Worcester, and Springfield have the most homeless students enrolled in their public schools. Slautterback said some school districts help families who are struggling to find stable housing, but the search can be difficult. “There are limitations to how far [these efforts] are going to go,"" Slautterback said. “Housing is just plain scarce in some of these places. We're here, we're working with families, but we can't find any housing to move them into.""

691,2476011700,"President-elect Joe Biden's selection of Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh for his Cabinet means that City Council President Kim Janey is poised to become the first Black person and first woman to serve as the city's mayor, making history amid a social justice movement sweeping the state and the nation.Under city rules, if Walsh resigns to become labor secretary, he would be replaced by the council president, the post Janey has held since January 2019. She would serve as acting mayor until a new election.The second-term councilor, who raised a daughter as a teenager in Roxbury, would bring to the mayor's office an unprecedented perspective of Boston, a city still struggling to heal its racial wounds.“Every mayor of this city has been a white male,'' said Michael Curry, president of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers. Curry noted that Janey comes from a Roxbury family steeped in community and activism. “She is no novice to politics and she's not new to the community.”Janey campaigned for City Council on the platform of bringing equity and wealth to Boston's neighborhoods, and “making sure everyone has a seat at the table.”In a statement Thursday, Janey, 56, congratulated Walsh and said, should his appointment be confirmed by the Senate, “I am ready to take the reins and lead our city through these difficult times.”She gave no indication of whether she would run for a full term as mayor later this year, though friends say they would be surprised if she does not give it strong consideration. Two of her colleagues on the City Council, Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell, are already in the race, and the field could expand.The elevation from district councilor to mayor would be a swift, life-changing turn of events for Janey, a direct and outspoken activist known to set up shop at the Dudley Cafe restaurant in her neighborhood. As acting mayor she will have a driver, her own elevator to a sprawling City Hall office, and, most significantly, the attention that comes with running the city and control over the vast bureaucracy.Wilnelia Rivera, a political strategist who befriended Janey during a campaign for another candidate several years ago, called her a “lifetime advocate” who has an opportunity to seize the moment and carry her Roxbury-based activism into the city's most powerful office.“I think this is a moment that represents a lot for that particular neighborhood,” she said. “I really look forward to seeing what it means to be a city led by Kim Janey.”Janey would serve in an acting role until a new election, which would be scheduled according to when Walsh officially leaves. If the mayor leaves after March 5, Janey would remain in office until the scheduled November general election. But if he leaves before then, the City Council could call for a special election within 120 to 140 days of his departure, City Clerk Maureen Feeney said.Feeney said her office had not been officially notified of Walsh's departure, which would start the process.The last time a sitting mayor left office in Boston, in 1993, then-district councilor Thomas M. Menino used the perch to steamroll a large field of candidates to win the job outright.As acting mayor, Janey would be a formidable opponent if she chose to run, said John Nucci, who ran for mayor in 1993 and is now senior vice president for external affairs at Suffolk University. In Boston, incumbent mayors have advantages that will be difficult for any candidate to overcome.”They have all the perks of incumbency but yet they can still run as an outsider,” he said.Janey would take over the city's top job amid significant challenges, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 1,000 lives in Boston, new rules meant to rein in police abuses, and a building boom that could sputter amid the economic slowdown caused by the virus.In her three years on the council, she has proven willing to confront some of the city's most important policy areas head-on, guiding the diverse council — with the greatest number of women and people of color in city history — to enact reforms in public safety, and health and education programs.She was often at odds with the mayor, moving to give the council more authority in developing housing and economic policies.Early in her tenure, she helped craft the city's first ordinance to overhaul the process of picking prospective marijuana operators, giving the City Council unprecedented power and pushing back against the mayor's own proposals.And after protesters took to city streets in the spring to demand reforms to the police department, she led the councilors to draft a bluntly worded “Black and Brown Agenda” for the city to explore new ways to build up neglected communities. The letter was delivered to the mayor on the Juneteenth holiday.She worked with Wu, who announced her candidacy for mayor in September, to expose the embarrassingly low percentage of city contracts for minority and women vendors; the work led to new initiatives to help support small businesses in Boston.In the last council election, she shared campaign headquarters with Wu in Roxbury, and Wu nominated Janey for council president in January 2019.Janey has also worked with Campbell, who also announced her mayoral campaign in September, on several police reforms.In past interviews with the Globe, Janey said that voters gave her and the council a mandate to take bolder action to boost equality and opportunities.She called her district “ground zero” for the issues confronting Boston: economic and racial inequity; an affordable housing crisis; an opioid epidemic; and a transportation mess that has clogged city streets. Janey said she is well aware of the community's plight: Growing up in Roxbury, she witnessed firsthand the struggles that families in the neighborhood face. The pandemic and difficulties with remote learning have only magnified those difficulties, she has said in council hearings.She said she learned from a young age to be an advocate, specifically on education. Her parents were both educators who fought for her to attend better schools. Before she was elected to the council, she worked as project director at Massachusetts Advocates for Children.As a councilor, Janey has faced criticism of what has been called the gentrification of Roxbury. And that pressure is likely to escalate when she serves as acting mayor.Priscilla Flint-Banks, cofounder of the Black Economic Justice Institute on the Roxbury border, knew Janey as a strong advocate in public education and had expected the same level of advocacy for economic development in Roxbury when Janey was elected to the council, and, later, council president. But she said Janey could have done more.Now with two other women already in the mayoral race, Flint said she will wait and see how Janey handles the role of acting mayor.“It's really a time for a change in our city,” said Flint, who also leads the Black Boston COVID-19 Coalition. “This is an opportunity for us to have a Black person sitting in the mayor's seat. . . . If I were her, I would do the best that I can while I'm acting mayor so that I can be mayor — if that's what she wants.”Meghan Irons of the Globe staff contributed to this report.",1/8/2021,"('been', 'called', 'the')","('roxbury', 'and', 'that')","['As a councilor, Janey has faced criticism of what has been called the gentrification of Roxbury.']",As a councilor Janey has faced criticism of what has been called the gentrification of Roxbury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
781,2522531284,"When Northeastern University filed plans in 2019 to build a massive dormitory at Columbus Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, Kim Janey was not a fan of the proposal. Janey, then a city councilor, sent a letter to the Boston Planning & Development Agency expressing her “deep concern"" about the project and Northeastern's relationship with its neighbors in her Roxbury district.Now Janey runs the city as acting mayor, and the school's plans for its dorm are about to land on her desk. With a key vote by the BPDA coming as soon as this spring, many in her neighborhood remain staunchly opposed to the dorm.The project is shaping up as an early test for the acting mayor and her approach to large-scale development. It also highlights how positions Janey took as a district city councilor might — or might not — evolve now that she represents the entire city.At issue is a 25-story tower — mostly dorm space, with classrooms on the lower floors — that Northeastern would co-develop with private student housing builder American Campus Communities. It would transform a parking lot on a key corner of Roxbury into another high-profile building in a neighborhood that has long eyed the university's southward expansion with suspicion.As part of the project, Northeastern is offering to set aside the ground floor as community space geared toward small business and economic development in Roxbury. But critics worry that the rest of the tower — with its 810 dorm beds expected to cost around $1,500 a month — will further accelerate mounting economic pressures on the largely Black and working-class neighborhood next door.“The issue here is they're creating this very high-cost housing, and they're placing it in Roxbury, facing the community,"" said former city councilor and mayoral candidate Tito Jackson, who has long been critical of Northeastern's dealings in the neighborhood. “I believe they're driving displacement and the gentrification of lower Roxbury on purpose.""When Janey succeeded Jackson on the City Council in 2017, she took a similar stance. And she was quick to blast Northeastern's plan when it was filed with the city in late 2019. She pointed to a new Northeastern engineering building just up Columbus Avenue and a high-rise dorm the university had opened that fall as projects that did little to help the community as the school promised.“This new development stands to be no different,"" she wrote in a letter to the BPDA, “and will certainly exacerbate the housing shortage and availability crisis to which Northeastern has heavily contributed.""But one way that previous mayors, especially Janey's predecessor, Martin J. Walsh, tried to address the citywide housing shortage was by urging universities to build more dorms, pulling their students out of apartments in campus-adjacent neighborhoods. Indeed, in a statement, Northeastern said the dorm project being debated now was launched “at the request of the city.""“In creating more opportunities for students to live on campus, this development will actually reduce gentrification in surrounding neighborhoods,"" the university said. It has agreed to vacate several apartment buildings it leases in the Fenway when the dorm opens, freeing them up for general use.That promise has won Northeastern the support of other neighborhood groups, including the Fenway Community Development Corp., which has long agitated for local colleges to house more of their own students to ease rents in that part of town.“We have an affordable housing crisis in this city,"" said Rich Giordano, Fenway Community Development's director of policy. “Building a dorm there will actually help address it.""How the Janey administration might address the conflicting priorities is not yet clear. The project is under BPDA review, with a community meeting being planned for later this month. Northeastern is pushing for a board vote by June, which it says is essential to starting construction in time to open the dorm for the 2024-25 school year. The acting mayor's office declined interview requests on the project, but in a statement signaled a willingness to keep negotiating.“The BPDA and Mayor Janey are working closely with Northeastern and the community to resolve the concerns the proposed dorm has raised, including how it will support the neighboring communities and benefit the residents of Roxbury,"" it read.Janey's position on building projects could be a key factor in her campaign to win election this fall. Scrutiny of her views on development started early in her tenure as acting mayor. In March, a week after she was sworn in, Janey drew fire over two matters before the city's Zoning Board of Appeals.First, a Janey representative said the mayor would not take a position on a proposed digital billboard on Causeway Street, but suggested the billboard could be appropriate — a declaration that upset the many opponents of the project, including the BPDA and several city councilors. The plan was ultimately voted down.Then, in the same meeting, she also offered support for a plan by short-term rental operator Sonder to convert 26 downtown apartments into executive suites — furnished apartments that can be rented out much like a hotel room. That tactic is seen by many people as a way to exploit a loophole in Boston's strict rules barring some short-term rentals.In 2018, as a councilor, Janey had backed those rules, which aim to prevent landlords from leasing apartments by the night on platforms such as Airbnb and instead keep them in the city's general housing stock. Several councilors said Sonder was trying to flout the regulations by seeking an exemption. But Janey supported the company, and its request was approved.“It was disappointing to see us, under the current administration, support the executive suites,"" said Councilor Lydia Edwards at a recent City Council hearing on the issue. “I would call on [us] to make sure that we're consistent, and that we look back on what we fought for as a council to make sure we don't undo it.""In her Roxbury backyard, several neighborhood activists said they hope Janey will hold a firm line with Northeastern. Angie Camacho, one of nine people running to succeed Janey on the City Council, said she understands that the acting mayor has a broader purview now, but she urged her to consider other options to address Northeastern's housing needs. The university, Camacho said, is “encroaching on the neighborhood.""“As mayor, I can see where she would be doing things differently,"" she said. “There's a balance there that we haven't found the right solution for.""Being well-versed in the long history of Northeastern and Roxbury, Janey should be able to strike that balance, said former state senator Dianne Wilkerson.The corner where Northeastern wants to build the dorm is the last chunk of a 6-acre site — known as Parcel 18 — that was cleared in the 1960s for the inner-belt highway project that Roxbury and Jamaica Plain residents eventually fought off. In the 1980s, former governor Michael Dukakis awarded Parcel 18 to a group of minority investors as part of the development of the One Lincoln tower downtown.In the mid '90s, a Registry of Motor Vehicles office was built there, quickly to be abandoned over concerns about poor air quality. Northeastern acquired the site and built its Renaissance Park garage and office building and the huge International Village dorm complex. Now it aims to finish the site with its dorm tower, though it faces a lawsuit, filed in December in Suffolk County, from the original investor group. Those investors say they're still entitled to a piece of anything that gets built on Parcel 18. Northeastern disagrees.The property has long been considered vital to bringing good jobs and economic development to Roxbury, Wilkerson said. Northeastern should be pushed to make that happen, she said, whether by Janey or whoever might follow her in the mayor's office. The university has had its way on the edge of Roxbury for too long, Wilkerson said.“The welcome mat they may have felt they had on the fifth floor of City Hall is not going to be extended to them much longer,"" said Wilkerson, who is leading an effort to unite support around a single Black candidate in the mayor's race but has not yet endorsed one. “Standing up to the university is going to be a requirement for whoever sits there.""Tim Logan can be reached at timothy.logan@globe.com.

120,2545306083,"FALMOUTH, Maine — One bright, brisk morning last month, Colleen Francke steered her skiff a mile off the coast of Falmouth and cut the gas. A few white buoys bobbed in straight lines on the water. Francke reached down and hoisted a rope.She has been lobstering for a decade and a half, she says, but as climate change warms local waters and forces lobsters northward, she's been finding it harder to envision a future in that industry.So, for the last two years, she's been developing a new source of income. Heaving the rope aloft, she showed off her bounty: ribbons of brown, curly sugar kelp, raised on her 10-acre undersea farm.Kelp, a seaweed more often thought of as a nuisance by fishermen, is emerging as a potentially lucrative crop, hailed for its many uses as a miracle food to an ingredient in bioplastics to a revolutionary way to feed beef cattle. And Maine officials, confronting a likely decline of the state's iconic lobster fishing industry in coming decades, are now looking to kelp farming as a possible economic and environmental savior.The state is working with local institutions to support training and grants for entrepreneurs such as Francke willing to move into kelp farming or other aquaculture ventures. It also labeled kelp a “natural climate solution"" in its recently released Climate Action plan. The goal, officials say, is to dramatically expand kelp farming as part of a reinvention of Maine's seafood industry — and imagining a future in which kelp from Maine is held in something akin to the esteem that Maine lobster is now.“We think kelp and other aquaculture offer … a connection to a next generation workforce and innovation for a heritage industry,"" said Heather Johnson, Maine's commissioner of economic and community development. “That is key to the longstanding sustainability of the existing supply chains.""Rich in nutrients and vitamins, kelp has long been consumed as a staple in Asian cultures. In the last several years, it's been increasingly incorporated into health, beauty, and food products in the United States. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations named seaweed farming the fastest growing sector in aquaculture, and the research firm Global Market Insights estimates the worldwide market for seaweed will grow to $85 billion by 2026.Now 35, Francke helped build the first kelp farm in Maine a decade ago. Today the industry has taken off in the state, with over 100 farming sites now dotting the coast. It's a relatively simple and remarkably sustainable process: There are no inputs like fresh water, fertilizer, or feed. Fishermen place spore-holding sorus tissue along lengths of rope and submerge them, letting Mother Nature do the rest. Just 4 pounds of sorus can seed 30,000 pounds of kelp for harvest.Maine kelp farms in 2020 produced 450,000 pounds, nearly double the harvest of just two years before. This year they're on track to bring in more than 800,000 pounds, and, in so doing, are leading the nation in this nascent industry, which is seeing some farms pop up in Alaska and on the West Coast.But that's a fraction of what the Island Institute, a community development corporation in Rockland, Maine, that has funded aquaculture business development programs in the state, estimates is possible. By its calculations, that figure could soar to nearly 6 million pounds by 2035. But even those numbers are dwarfed by China, which, according to the UN, produced more than 14 million tons of farmed seaweed in 2017.Climate change has warmed Maine's coastal waters by 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit a year over the past three decades, with the Gulf of Maine warming faster than 99 percent of the global ocean. It's made the lobster industry more volatile, and has decreased catches of groundfish, scallops, or soft shell crabs that lobstermen could rely on in an off year, said Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at the Island Institute.Kelp farming, she said, offers lobstermen additional off-season income, using equipment they already have on hand. There's also the added benefit of kelp's “halo effect"": it sucks up carbon dioxide in the water where it grows and reduces acidification and nutrient pollution in the state's coastal waters.“We have actually found that if you grow your shellfish in close proximity to a kelp farm, they can have thicker shells, denser shells, and they're harder to break,"" said Arnold.The challenge now, she said, is convincing US consumers that kelp is not just a way to diversify one's diet but also a way to help fight climate change.“Americans aren't necessarily used to eating seaweed. And in order to change hearts and minds about that, especially people who care about climate change, it's really important to sell the product in that way,"" said Arnold. “It's good for these local businesses. It's also — and I mean it — truly is good for the planet.""It may help that Maine's appetite for kelp farming comes as the country's food establishment has been questioning its relationship with meat. Citing the beef industry's contributions to climate change, Epicurious, the ubiquitous Condé Nast food blog, recently announced that it had ceased publishing recipes with beef, and the acclaimed New York restaurant Eleven Madison Park announced in May that it was switching to an all-vegan menu.Francke sells most of her harvest to a local startup called AKUA that makes kelp jerky and this summer released a kelp burger that was favorably reviewed by The New York Times and Bon Appétit.Advocates are hoping kelp can become another buzzy alternative protein with a sustainability aura that could bring in millions of venture funding, such as faux burger brands Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.But, that's “just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we can do with kelp,"" said Briana Warner, the CEO of Atlantic Sea Farms, the largest processor of kelp in Maine. “We're seeing innovation in bioplastics and kelp-made textiles, food additives, and animal feeds. Food is just the start ... the possibilities are really endless.""Bioplastics, which are typically made from renewable sources such as kelp, are just one way seaweed could have a huge impact on climate change. A subset of the industry is also looking at whether kelp farming could be used to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And researchers at the University of California Davis have found that feeding seaweed to beef cows can help reduce the amount of methane they produce by 82 percent.But to get to the point where Maine could actually produce enough kelp to sustain any of these big ideas means wading into some fraught territory.Maine's Department of Marine Resources oversees the distribution of aquaculture leases in the state, and there's been increasing pushback from local fishermen and wealthy waterfront landowners about plans for the rapid expansion of such farms along the coast. Most of that opposition has been directed at large fisheries where salmon or other species are grown in pens, but kelp farms, because they operate using the same aquaculture lease permitting system, have become ensnared in those debates.Francke, who has applied to the Maine Department of Marine Resources to expand her farm from 10 acres to 100, which would be the largest in the state, has become a target of critics. If her application succeeds, said Crystal Canney, executive director of Protect Maine's Fishing Heritage Foundation, a foundation opposing the expansion of aquaculture, you've “lost all that bottom to lobstering. You cannot put lobster traps in that area — you get tangled.""Canney says that over the past 15 years, Maine has haphazardly increased access to aquaculture leases and now allows farmers to lease more than 1,000 acres of water for up to 20 years. In April, a state lawmaker proposed legislation that would limit the size of aquaculture leases and change how leases are transferred in Maine.“Kelp has great potential for the state of Maine, no question about that,"" Canney said. But letting a kelp farmer such as Francke expand to 100 acres could end up displacing lobstermen in the process, she argues. Soon, she said, “10 more Colleen Franckes can do the same thing in the same area because lease approvals are at 97 percent.""Entangling things further is new statewide legislation passed in 2019 that allows homeowners with waterfront property in Maine to weigh in on the aquaculture permitting process — offering testimony and presenting witnesses at public hearings.Aquaculture advocates say that many wealthy homeowners are paying top dollar to hire lawyers to keep oyster, mussel, or kelp farms away from their waterfront views. “The landowners don't want to look at it or smell it,"" Sebastian Belle, the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. “They will often lawyer up and throw everything they can at the situation and see what sticks.""Belle says such wealthy backers are behind the Protect Maine's Fishing Heritage Foundation, which aligns itself with some lobsterman to oppose such farms. But he argues that such action could be the fishermen's own undoing.“A fundamental demographic shift is happening on the coast of Maine and COVID has accelerated that,"" he said. “The gentrification of the Maine coastline is really pushing working waterfront families out.""“Aquaculture is really the only way left open for a traditional working waterfront family to add to their income,"" he said.Should her expanded farm come to fruition, Francke says she's designed it with enough space between her lines that lobstermen could steer their boats through it.“Colleen is one of our newer farmers and she has some different approaches,"" said Belle. “She's more interested in going big than some of the other farms are.""And that's made her among the first to experience growing pains in the industry.“I think people look at that 100-acre number and they pass judgment before they even know what the design of the lease is,"" Francke said. But what concerns her more is that if she's thwarted in her effort to scale up, it means the industry won't grow, and she'll have less of an impact on climate change.“I look at growing this farm in one of these uber-rich communities, and look at these McMansions with these neon green lawns, and I know my farm is only going to do so much to combat what it's like to maintain and heat that home and the chemicals on that lawn,"" she said.She'd love to sustain herself financially through kelp farming, but her larger goal is to inspire others to do their part.“If one individual can actually make a positive change,"" she said, “there's something else everyone can be doing to make their own positive impact toward our climate problem.""Janelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com.

1071,2562735465,"If it's nighttime in Boston, neon signs are a sure source of beauty and light. Who can imagine the city without its Paramount Theatre marquee? Or the Boston Wharf Company banner, bathing the streetscape with its molten glow?Though the signs appear steadfast, the artisans at Somerville's Neon Williams — one of the last neon sign shops in New England — are devoted to preserving these dazzling displays in the Boston area.“If it's a neon sign, and it's around here, it's probably made by us,"" said Dave Waller, who co-owns Neon Williams with his wife, Lynn.In addition to servicing Boston's surviving signs, Neon Williams also bends tubes for the new ones that crop up. Business has dimmed considerably since the shop's 20th-century heyday; at one point, icons including the Citgo sign, the Shell “Spectacular,"" and the North End's Regina Pizzeria marquee were lit with the shop's handiwork. Now, all three run on LED lighting.Despite the darkness of the pandemic — “we thought we were going to close,"" Dave Waller said — this past June was the busiest month since the Wallers took over the shop in 2019. As people cleared out their attics, Neon Williams found itself swamped with repair jobs. Restaurants, including Donut Villa Diner in Central Square and Vera's in Somerville, spruced up with new signs as they anticipated the return of customers. A whopping 13 neon signs bent in the shop can be spotted in the new movie “Free Guy,"" which filmed in Massachusetts.Neon's timeless appeal was much of the reason for the Wallers taking over the shop. Waller remembers picking up a repair from Neon Williams in 2018 when one of the previous owners broke news of their plans to shutter the business. The owners offered to sell Waller their inventory, but he had a different idea.“I saw two people bringing in neon signs to be repaired, and I thought to myself, 'This is a going business,""' said Waller, who lives in Malden. “There's a well-worn path to the door — maybe we can try to do something with it.""That well-worn path began in 1934 when Wally Croft opened the “Long Life Neon Tubes"" company, which transformed into C.M. Williams & Sons in the 1960s when it changed hands to Charlie Williams. When his sons, Dana and Steven, took over in the '80s, it became Neon Williams.“It's really been a family business,"" said Waller, who took it upon himself to preserve the shop's history on its website, through interviews with the Williams brothers and Grace Williams, Steven's wife and the former business manager of the company. “Even though it's been three different families.""The shop bounced from location to location before finally landing in Somerville. In the 1980s, Neon Williams had 17 full-time employees. Today, it's down to just the Wallers and glass benders Nick McKnight and Tony Dowers.Neon began painting Boston red (and purple and green) in the 1920s, when the new advertising medium blazed its way to America from France. In neon's golden era, rhapsodies in ruby red and ocean blue beckoned atop buildings from downtown to Roxbury.“Back in the day, if you didn't have a neon sign, you didn't have a business,"" Waller said. “We have neon signs from funeral parlors to police stations to courthouses.""Creating the signs is no easy feat. Glass bending, the painstaking process of creating the bespoke signs, is an art form as mesmerizing as the finished product. McKnight and Dowers, the shop's glass benders, closely follow design patterns made by Dowers and Lynn Waller, holding slender glass tubes — in a variety of colors and sizes — over concentrated flames. The sign's final color, they say, depends on the combination of the tube's color and the gases. Neon has a natural crimson glow, while argon (with a drop of mercury) casts a steely blue.“What's happening inside the tube is a phenomenon,"" said Waller, who also owns the digital production studio Brickyard in Boston. “It's lightning, essentially.""It's an art that takes years to learn but results in a sign that can stay lit nonstop for eight to 15 years, according to McKnight.“If you had a time machine and you could bring somebody from the 1920s,"" Waller said, “they could just walk into the shop and start making neon. Not much has changed . . . they kind of got it right the first time.""While the craft itself hasn't changed much, neon's reputation has undergone radical transformations over the decades. Its appeal faded in the latter half of the 20th century, especially after the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 led to widespread anti-neon edicts. Even now, neon signs are heavily regulated in certain areas of Boston.Neon also became associated with a certain, ahem, tawdry business. In the Combat Zone, the name given in the 1960s to Boston's adult entertainment district, a place called Club 66 flaunted the neon silhouette of a naked woman in the 1970s.Neon partially overcame this notoriety in the mid-1970s and '80s as artists worked to reclaim the craft. At that point, Neon Williams was churning out more than 100 signs a week, according to a 1985 Globe article.Waller, 58, has been an avid neon sign collector since age 9. He grew up in Lynnfield, back when Route 1 teemed with sculptures of light. In the '80s, he started preserving these endangered relics, and he enlisted Lynn when they began dating in 1988. “It wasn't like, 'What are we going to do this weekend?""' Waller recalled. “It was more like, 'Which neon sign are we going to rescue before they go to the dump?""'Dozens of these recovered signs — from a “Kiddie Land"" arc that once welcomed patrons to Rhode Island's Crescent Park, to a candy-red Dunkin' Donuts sign circa 1955 — now hang in Neon Williams's cramped Joy Street workshop. Most are available for rent. Waller estimates that Neon Williams has inherited the inventory of 12 different neon shops as they shuttered, one by one, over the years.The shop's rescues can also be spotted all over the city. “I put [signs] into restaurants or venues semi-permanently and then rent them for a dollar a year, just to get them out and enjoyed by the public,"" said Waller, who displayed eight vintage signs from his collection on the Rose Kennedy Greenway in 2018. “The last thing I want to do is hoard them all.""So Neon Williams finds itself holding on, despite the proliferation in recent years of cheaper, more environmentally efficient LED lighting. But what will it take to keep the lights on in the years to come?Construction of the East Somerville station of the Green Line extension is adjacent to the shop, and the North River Company, which acquired the property and surrounding area in May of 2020, may relocate the shop to the nearby Joy Street Studios, said North River Company vice president Andy Dulac. Waller said he considered buying a piece of property for the shop but that nothing near Boston is in his price range.“We will not be able to afford wherever we go — to set up the neon plant and the electricity and get it permitted,"" Waller said, expressing concern about gentrification of the Somerville neighborhood.The one certainty? Neon Williams's signs will keep the city aglow for years.“That's kind of fun, to be part of the continuing legacy of neon in the city,"" Waller said. “Being the ones who are keeping these things lit.""Dana Gerber can be reached at dana.gerber@globe.comCredit: By Dana Gerber GLOBE CORRESPONDENT",8/20/2021,"('expressing', 'concern', 'about')","('the', 'somerville', 'neighborhoodthe')","['“We will not be able to afford wherever we go — to set up the neon plant and the electricity and get it permitted,"" Waller said, expressing concern about gentrification of the Somerville neighborhood.']",We will not be able to afford wherever we go  to set up the neon plant and the electricity and get it permitted Waller said expressing concern about gentrification of the Somerville neighborhood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
782,2570123490,"At Ula Cafe in Jamaica Plain, random acts of kindness just got a little more organized.A pay-it-forward wall, where customers can purchase an item, write it on a sticky note, and add it to a blackboard inside the Egleston Square coffeehouse for another patron to redeem, was put up in early June.“We want Ula to be known for more than just being a cafe — we want it to continue to be known as a place where people feel welcome and valued,” said Beth Santos, a co-owner of Ula. “I just hope that the pay-it-forward wall becomes something that's not special at all, because it's just such a regular part of your Ula experience.”Santos took over Ula with her husband, Marvin Mathelier, and Kelly Fernandes, who also serves as executive chef, in early June. Their menu is built around classic cafe fare like breakfast burritos, roast beef sandwiches, and plenty of coffee and pastry options. It was the CNN series “Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy” that inspired Santos to initiate the pay-it-forward wall.In the first episode, Tucci, the Academy Award-nominated actor and foodie, travels to Naples, where a policeman orders a “caffè sospeso” — a suspended coffee — a tradition in the region where a coffee is ordered and then later redeemed by a person in need.“I was like, 'That is such a JP thing,'” Santos said. “I think our neighborhood would really eat that up.”She hung the pay-it-forward display on an empty wall in the shop, and “it took off literally from day one,” Santos said. A popover, a small iced tea, and a lunch sandwich were all recent items up for grabs. Customers can redeem up to two items per person.“I knew in my bones that people would buy stuff, because our neighborhood is just such an amazing neighborhood,” Santos said, “but I honestly wasn't sure if people would redeem it.”Santos said she worried that people who didn't have the money to pay for items wouldn't come into the cafe at all, or that they might not be comfortable using the wall's gifts.“This is our way of helping each other,” she said. “Maybe you left your wallet at home, maybe your lights were turned off. Whatever the reason is … everyone should be able to eat at Ula regardless of your financial situation.”The sticky notes now rotate regularly, Santos said, and it's always filled with the generosity of strangers, some of whom include little notes, like “spread some joy today.” Customers ordering online through ChowNow can also purchase items to be added to the wall.“We hear stories of people being pushed out of the neighborhood and I feel like a lot of us really don't know what to do about it,” said Santos, pointing to the gentrification of the area. “At the same time, I think each of us has our own power to help our neighbors.”The pay-it-forward project isn't the only social justice undertaking from Ula, a Black-owned, women-owned, and veteran-owned business . A portion of proceeds from the monthly specialty drink goes to a different cause every month — in September, the drink is a spiced pear ginger beer sparkler, and the organization is Women for Afghan Women.“I'm so happy that at least within our cafe that's tucked away in JP, we're supporting as best as we can across the other side of the world,” said Mathelier, a veteran who served in Afghanistan.The cafe is also hosting a school supply drive through Sept. 15 for Schools on Wheels of Massachusetts. Sustainable food is also a priority in the eatery, which is aiming to eliminate all single-use plastics from the store by 2023.The next step for the wall, Mathelier and Santos said, is making sure as many people as possible know it's there. “We still surprise people when they come in our door sometimes,” Santos said. To increase foot traffic, they want to start doing community events, like open mics or story slams. “The more people that come in our doors, the more people that are participating in the wall and helping each other,” Santos said.",9/8/2021,"('pointing', 'to', 'the')","('the', 'area', 'at')","[""“We hear stories of people being pushed out of the neighborhood and I feel like a lot of us really don't know what to do about it,” said Santos, pointing to the gentrification of the area.""]",We hear stories of people being pushed out of the neighborhood and I feel like a lot of us really dont know what to do about it said Santos pointing to the gentrification of the area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1299,2666827789,"Anne Undeland may be a longtime resident of the Berkshires — a place she says is suffused with Edith Wharton's spirit and where the author's Lenox estate, The Mount, is located — but it wasn't until Undeland was 30 when she began reading Wharton's work. Besotted, she quickly devoured “The House of Mirth,” “The Age of Innocence,” and more. “I really couldn't get enough,” Undeland says by phone from her home in Lanesborough. “She's been one of my favorite writers for a long time.”Still, it was only when she read the passionate letters between Wharton and her lover Morton Fullerton that an idea for a play began to take shape. Those letters, which Fullerton kept despite Wharton asking him to burn them, were discovered after her death in 1937. “This sense of longing and yearning and ecstasy and pain — and all those feelings that go along with falling headlong in love with somebody — really touched a nerve in me,” Undeland says. “And that glorious but excruciating feeling is really quite universal.”Those letters, some erotically charged, others heartsick expressions of longing, provided the inspiration for Undeland's new play, “Mr. Fullerton, Between the Sheets,” that Gloucester Stage Company is mounting July 1-24, directed by Judy Braha. A work of historical fiction, the play is set in the early 20th century after the massive success of “The House of Mirth.” Stuck in a stultifying marriage, Wharton (Sarah Newhouse) is living in Paris for a spell when she falls for fellow writer Fullerton (Ryan Winkles), an itinerant bon vivant and correspondent for the Times of London.The affair with Fullerton, Undeland says, “really woke Edith Wharton up, and I think she comes to understand herself in a much deeper and fuller way. This sexual awakening had a cascading effect on her as an artist and as a person for the rest of her life.”As she becomes consumed with the affair, Wharton confabs with her close friend and fellow literary wit Henry James (Joshua Wolf Coleman) and saucy Irish maid Posy (Bridgette Hayes), who's been secretly reading Wharton's finished pages and later awakens the high-born author to the realities and lives of the working class.The Harvard-educated Fullerton was a mysterious figure, always on the move and often juggling multiple affairs. He “ghosts” Wharton at times and often doesn't write back. “He was a fascinating, immensely seductive person,” Undeland says. “But I think his power was really in the bedroom, and I think he really loved to wake that part of people up.”“I think all of us have been there where we've loved somebody more than they've loved us,” she adds, “or we've wanted more from them than they were giving back to us.”Wharton was 46 and at the height of her powers as an author when she met Fullerton. “She was formidable and terrifying and always the smartest person in the room and up on this forbidding pedestal,” Undeland says. And yet he still left her in a puddle of lovesick devotion and desperate heartbreak.Indeed, for a woman of profound intellect “who was so caught up in her mind,” Undeland says, “it's quite amazing and beautiful that she falls in love in such a full-bodied way and has this sexual awakening and this love awakening at an age where she thought all those doors were closed to her.”“Mr. Fullerton” is the second of five plays in Gloucester's mainstage season, overseen by Boston theater luminary Paula Plum, who took over as the theater's interim artistic director last winter. The season kicks off with Branden Jacobs-Jenkins's Pulitzer Prize finalist “Gloria,” running June 3-26. An office satire turned tragedy focuses on a group of ambitious young worker bees at a prestigious cultural magazine. When their ordinary day at the office turns horrific, how far will they go to avoid self-scrutiny and capitalize on their own trauma? Plum describes the play as “a commentary on the disintegration of our society and how compassion can be compromised for ambition.”Bess Wohl's Tony-nominated comedy about marital malaise, “Grand Horizons,” checks in July 29-Aug. 21. It centers on a retired couple's decision to divorce after 50 years and the unexpected effects of that split on their adult children. “When that mirror gets shattered,” Plum says, “the family doesn't have its own self-image anymore, and their kids become a mess.”“Paradise Blue,” the third play in Dominique Morisseau's Detroit cycle, runs Aug. 26-Sept. 18. In Detroit's Black Bottom neighborhood in 1949, trumpeter and bandleader Blue fields a lucrative offer for his jazz club and grapples with pressure from friends and neighbors not to sell, despite his desire to leave behind a traumatic past. “It's a historical look at the gentrification of Detroit in a neighborhood filled with people struggling to keep their community together as real estate developers move in,” Plum says.The final entry of the season, Lucas Hnath's “The Thin Place,” arrives just in time for spooky season, Sept. 30-Oct. 23. In this eerie ghost story, a woman befriends a medium in order to connect with the spirit of her beloved grandmother. “You question what you see before your own eyes,” Plum says. “There are moments of shock and surprise.”MR.

357,2675640865,"By Boston standards, it's a relatively bucolic setting to spark a political brawl.Crane Ledge Woods, as the contested property is known, is defined by a ridge that overlooks a quiet, leafy, residential neighborhood dotted with manicured lawns. Multiple side streets in this corner of Hyde Park end in cul-de-sacs because of the steep incline, with walls of green and rocky-topped bluffs rising to act as a natural border for some backyards.But make no mistake: Here, at the edge of these dappled woods, an old-school spat seethes, powered by concerns that strike at the heart of questions about the city's future. Amid an intractable housing crisis and a steadily warming planet, in a city rife with inequality, what should take priority: housing development or environmental conservation?On one side of the beef are residents and advocates, “Save Crane Ledge Woods” signs bristling from their lawns, who want to see the 14-acre wood preserved as open green space. They say this patch of forest prevents flooding and acts as a coolant for nearby neighborhoods, which they fear will become hotter should a developer turn part of it into asphalt and buildings. Boston only has so much open space left, they argue, and this particular parcel is “a gem.”“If Crane Ledge Woods is eliminated, the whole city loses,” said Barbara Hamilton, an East River Neighborhood Association Leader and lifelong Hyde Park resident.On the other side is Lincoln Property Company, represented by a well-connected son of Hyde Park, and the current property owner, a church that touts itself as the largest predominantly Black non-denominational Christian congregation in New England. Jubilee Christian Church has reached a purchase and sale agreement with Lincoln, which wants to invest $100 million to develop 270 residential units, including 41 affordable units, on the land here. The backers hope that it will help alleviate the housing crisis while giving the church a much-needed capital injection. The church has declined to say how much money it stands to make from its deal with Lincoln. The proposal is currently before the Boston Planning and Development Agency.For Dan Conley, a former Suffolk district attorney and former city councilor who grew up in Hyde Park and is representing Lincoln, the woods, because of the steep bluffs and rocky topography, are “really in some ways quite dangerous.” He said the developers are committed to a one-for-one replacement of every tree removed from the property and that the proposal includes ample open space, including ballfields and accessible nature trails — for a total of nearly 60 percent of the final project. During a recent phone call, he ticked off other selling points: 300 construction jobs, 15 permanent ones, an estimated $900,000 in annual tax revenue for the city.“The project is very worthwhile,” Conley said.Local advocates and residents have pushed back — hard — against that assessment, saying that although the city is in the midst of a housing crunch, developing the wood-covered bluffs is not the answer.Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has made the environment a pillar of her early tenure. But recent comments from Wu suggest the city is not able, or willing, to do anything at this stage regarding this project, such as trying to buy the property out from under Lincoln. During a recent news conference, the mayor acknowledged the concern of neighbors but noted, “this is a private property, and there's only so much the city can do.”“I am grateful to the property owners who have been in contact with the city as we continue to push for some resolution and some conversation,” Wu said.Andrew L. Ward, executive director of business, finance, and development for Jubilee Christian, said the church isn't interested in reneging on the sale to Lincoln. Indeed, he questioned whether the city could even afford to buy the property. He declined to detail how much it would take for the city to purchase the land.Conley also said the city taking over the property would be a poor use of public funds. To turn it into usable public space would require a “great deal of remedial work and then annual maintenance and . . . policing and public safety,” he said. That could cost the city tens of millions, according to Conley.For the Jubilee church, the sale would represent a significant injection of capital into an organization that has an estimated 6,000 congregants and locations in Mattapan, Stoughton, and Worcester. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down in-person services for about a year-and-a-half, dealing a significant blow to a church that relies on weekly in-person donations. Ward said the church purchased the parcel about two decades ago with the intention to build a new home for the congregation and relocate from Blue Hill Avenue. But as time rolled on, the church didn't feel the urge to uproot its Mattapan home, he said.The parcel, located near the Hyde Park-Roslindale line off American Legion Highway, is private property, both Ward and Conley noted. Anyone using it for, say, hiking or walking their dog, is technically trespassing. Signs reminding residents of that fact dot the fringe of the woods. Conley emphasized the proposal is “an as-of-right project” meaning it adheres to existing zoning laws and would not need zoning variances to be built.But Conley suggested the developers are fighting a battle on two fronts. Yes, there is the local opposition; but there is also the BPDA. Conley said that agency's design review design staff have opposed the proposed “garden style apartment development” because “it is not urban enough.”“We reject this view as narrow-minded,” Conley said in an e-mail.BPDA staff is currently reviewing a “draft project impact report” that was submitted by the developer last month. According to that agency, the “proposed development . . . will exacerbate the urban heat island effect, increase stormwater runoff and reduce the urban tree canopy in a neighborhood that is an environmental justice area.”Meanwhile, opponents are locking horns with the developer over a litany of disagreements.For instance, Conley has characterized the woods as a “former industrial site,” part of which, he said, was formerly a rock quarry decades ago.“We're not talking about building a steel plant or a chemical plant on the Arnold Arboretum,” he said.Advocates firmly reject such labeling.“That's absolutely ridiculous,” said Rick Yoder, a Roslindale resident who wants to preserve the woods.José C. Massó III, whose property abuts the woods, does not think the space is in disrepair.“Disrepair is in the eyes of the beholder, right?” said Massó, who is among those worried his property may flood should the development move forward. “I see ... what nature looks like if humans don't touch it.”But, one point the project's backers make is undeniable: Hyde Park already has a lot of protected open space compared with other parts of the city. According to city figures, Hyde Park has the highest ratio of protected open space of any Boston community, with 25.54 acres per 1,000 residents, a total of 275 acres. The citywide average is 7.59 acres per 1,000 residents. Neighboring Mattapan, by contrast, has just 52 acres of open space, or 6.38 acres per 1,000 residents.Opponents have tried to poke holes in a central plank of the developer's argument, that the new apartments would be a net plus for the city, given the housing crunch. Neighbors contend the 200-plus market-rate units could hasten gentrification of a neighborhood where 46 percent of residents are Black and 26 percent are Latino, according to city data. They dismiss the 41 proposed affordable units as insufficient.Conley said Lincoln plans to rent out two-bedroom units for $2,800 a month and a one-bedroom for $2,400.Globe correspondent Alexander Thompson contributed to this report.Correction: Because of incorrect information given to the Globe, an earlier version of this article included an inaccurate figure regarding the amount Lincoln Property Company planned to invest to develop Crane Ledge Woods.

958,2699592508,"It's the season of bachelorette parties, an increasingly frequent part of the wedding industrial complex. About 8 out of 10 brides in the United States gather their besties to celebrate. They may wear veils and penis hats, dance, and get drunk. These events often take place over the course of several days and add a few thousand dollars to the already high costs of weddings.Bachelorette parties are often attracted to queer spaces like gay bars and drag shows and for good reason. These mostly white women are trying to escape their straight world. They don't want to deal with the male gaze or sexual harassment while they're trying to dance with their girlfriends. They plan on being very inebriated and are reasonably afraid of sexual assault.But based on our research in Provincetown, their presence often destroys those spaces for the LGBTQ+ people who created them in the first place. We call this process “hetrification.” Like gentrification, hetrification occurs when people feel privileged to take over the spaces of others.Hetrification, like gentrification, is about money. In our research, many drag queens said that bachelorette parties are their main source of income and that fewer LGBTQ+ people attend their shows. Just as a gentrifier is able to exercise their financial prowess to seduce a seller, a hetrifier is likewise able to buy space in a queer venue. Many gay and lesbian spaces were the result of white gentrification of neighborhoods that were primarily Black and Latinx. But hetrificaiton, unlike gentrification, is an appropriation not just of space, but of culture. According to our LGBTQ+ interviewees, the women suffer from a “Will and Grace” complex. They think they can shout Cher lyrics and yell “Yaaaasssss, Queen!” because they are welcomed into gay culture. Our research shows otherwise.While hetrification and gentrification are equally insidious, they gradually ravage communities by different means. Gentrification operates like an invasive species. Gentrifiers take root and transform communities to the point where they become inhospitable to the original inhabitants. Gentrification gets its sting through the racialized intergenerational transfer of wealth through real estate.Hetrification weaponizes heteronormativity and breaks down queer spaces. Even though hetrifiers only temporarily invade queer spaces, the incessant visitation of heteronormative misconduct slowly diminishes the integrity of the space. Queer spaces are increasingly at risk of being disabled as safe havens for the LGBTQ+ community.Not that any of the bridal parties we interviewed knew they were hetrifiers. The bachelorettes — all college-educated, well-off, and almost exclusively white — understood how hard the fight for gay rights is, and wanted to be respectful. It's just after several drinks, many may grab the butt of a cute gay man or take selfies in front of the leather daddies as if they were exhibits in some queer zoo.Many of the bridal party participants believed that homophobia (they never discussed transphobia) was a thing of the past, something older generations had to deal with, but now that there was gay marriage, it just wasn't a problem. “One of my best friends is gay. He has never faced any discrimination,” said one. This level of ignorance about the actual state of affairs for LGBTQ+ populations in the United States was reminiscent of white Americans insisting racism was over once we had elected a Black man as president.Worse than their post-homophobic homophobia, when we asked the bridal parties if anyone in their group was lesbian, bisexual, or trans, they answered with a rather stunned “I have no idea” as if women's queerness was a topic best not broached. One bisexual woman in Provincetown said that she was often treated with revulsion by these women, taking her back to her high school days. “These were the same people who would have bullied me in high school. Now they want to come to our party?”To come into queer spaces and actually believe that we live in a post-homophobic world is a kind of hostile occupation. Asking bachelorette parties to occupy less space is only a Band-Aid for the toxic masculinity that makes straight party venues uncomfortable and even dangerous. Like gentrification, we witness a cycle of displacement where those with the least resources are left with nowhere to go. The women are displaced by rape culture and seek refuge in queer spaces, but the queers are faced with tolerating the heterosexual gaze or not showing up at all. We know the end of this story because we know how gentrification works. Follow the money.Hetrification will destroy queer spaces and maybe even queer culture itself.Vincent Jones II is assistant professor of community health and director of the Health Promotion Center at York College.

727,2350106465,"These bridges span much more than a canal. To traverse the Sagamore, from the north, or the Bourne, from the west, is to cross the boundary between work and play. As the last girder shrinks in the rearview mirror, the road opens onto the pine-fringed mid-Cape expressway. Already those knotted neck muscles are beginning to soften and uncoil.  The beaches we love — Marconi, Cahoon Hollow, Nauset, to name three — are still miles away. But the worst of the dreaded Cape traffic is behind us now. We are in a postcard land that evokes a particular memory, a four-word poem, for anyone who has had the good fortune to experience it: Summer on the Cape.  But this is no vacation. The Cape we love is at risk now. Cape Cod is perched on a stretch of ocean warming faster than nearly any in the world. And as much as we might wish it away, as hard as we try to ignore it, the effects of climate change here are already visible, tangible, measurable, disturbing.  Perfect summers have grown hotter and muggier. Storms arrive violently, and more often. Occasionally, nature sends up an even more ostentatious flare: A historic home vanishes. The earth opens up and swallows a Honda Civic. A seasoned fisherman on the waters off Provincetown peers over starboard and spies an unmistakable shock of electric green: mahi-mahi, visiting from the tropics. Along Old King's Highway, the route the Wampanoag once wore into the earth, the blooming summer hydrangeas and bustling ice cream stands look familiar and timeless. But if we are going to preserve this precious place, and this world, we must learn to look for warnings we would prefer to ignore. The marsh, the birds, the forest, the food: So much is changing, shifting, or washing away.  People here like to say that the only thing constant about the Cape is change, and indeed the sands left behind by an ice age that ended 18,000 years ago have always eroded and reshaped the shoreline. But what human-caused climate change has already wrought here is not the same old uncertainty. It is loss. And so, winding past the bay on which kids could once, before the water warmed, spend every winter ice skating, we criss-cross the Cape in search of what is slipping away. This is not a travelogue of the troubling future, or a preview of dire warnings that somehow go unheeded. It is about what we can already see happening, right now, on America's playground. It is about what we will lose if we don't look, harder than ever, at what global inaction will cost.  The Cape is fundamentally a peaceful place. For generations, we have talked about joy and family and the restorative power of open ocean and unspoiled sand.  But talk to the people who live and work here, who study emerging threats to the place they've always known, and you will hear them use different words: Higher ground. Breach. Retreat. Today they speak the language of war. HIDDEN IN THE WAVES From Dave Spang's perch high atop a sandy cliff in Truro, the vast ocean wriggles and writhes almost imperceptibly beneath a cloudless sky. More than 100 feet below Spang's red folding chair, seals bob in the surf. Gentle waves tickle the edge of the desolate beach. Staring out at the sea, Spang records the same careful measurements he has made three times a week, every week, for 15 years. Hidden somewhere in all his notes on water and time is a window into the forces that have hastened the erosion of the Outer Cape's shoreline, claiming yard upon yard of this very cliff. It is a threat that is both imminent and largely unseen.  Spang and his wife, Gwen, bear witness. They park near the overgrown ballfield where the old Air Force base's North Truro Blue Sox once played; they walk along the barbed-wire fencing and abandoned barracks and down a narrowing series of overgrown roads and dirt paths until Spang, still tall and sturdy at 81, stoops under a natural trellis of vines and brush and emerges into this small clearing at the end of the earth.  A shack about the size of a garden shed sits a few yards back from the edge, its windows boarded up year-round to discourage vandals.  From the shack, Spang retrieves his chair. Then, his left hand steadying his right before him like a marksman holding a pistol, he watches one wave pass his thumb and then counts the seconds until the next one does the same. He estimates their height. He gauges the angle at which they approach the shore.  In the roughly 15 years Spang has been volunteering to do this work, the sheer edge has lost about 50 feet. Several times — sometimes more than once a year — Spang has had to jack up the shed, slide rollers under it, and shove it back a few feet so it doesn't fall onto the beach far below.  Surrounded by the sea, the sands that shape the Cape have always shifted. Nearly 50 years ago, long before he began to count the waves, Spang helped pull the body of an 11-year-old boy from the sand on nearby Longnook Beach after a cliff collapse.  But something is different now. The ocean is rising faster than it has in thousands of years. The waves that eat at this shore are different now, too. They hit with more force, the result of a little-known phenomenon that Spang is helping to reveal.  During the Cold War, this air base was America's first line of defense against the threat of Soviet bombers. Airmen stood at the ready, manning a state-of-the-art radar station to detect a potential nuclear attack that might have ushered in the end of the world.  Today, Dave Spang closes one eye and stares at the sea beyond his thumb, detecting a new kind of threat.  What does he see? To fully understand the complex forces that now threaten Cape Cod, chronicling 15 years' worth of waves will not be nearly enough. To make any sense of the present and peer into the future, you have to look deep into the past.  Since the last of the ancient glaciers that covered the northern half of North America receded and left Cape Cod protruding from the coastline, erosion has been the Cape's geologic birthright. Engorged by melting ice, the Atlantic Ocean flooded the areas we now call the Gulf of Maine and Cape Cod Bay. Then, the sea rose slowly and steadily for thousands of years. The modern world had emerged from the mass of receding ice, and all that water was reshaping it. But since the middle of the 19th century, the warming of the earth due to climate change has caused sea levels to rise much faster, almost four times as fast. As a result, erosion on the Cape has accelerated to a geologic sprint. Today, the beaches on the Outer Cape lose an average of about 3 feet of shoreline a year as increasingly powerful waves slice away sand from the dunes and bluffs. Buildings erected far from the water's edge a generation ago now find themselves in harm's way. Every summer, homes along the cliffs in Truro and Wellfleet are painstakingly lifted and moved inland. About a mile north of the cliff where Spang counts the waves is Highland Light, a historic Truro lighthouse whose whole purpose was to advise navigators of their proximity to land; it had to be moved more than 400 feet inland in 1996.  Some homeowners have nowhere to retreat. In Truro, a ramshackle old home on Ballston Beach was in the Moore/Musnuff family for over a century. It was long a subject for artists seeking to capture the Cape's essence; Edward Hopper took a stab at it during his travels here. Wandering the galleries in Provincetown, the family would often spot renderings of their home.  John Musnuff spent his summers here, as a child playing on the beach and, eventually, as a father tinkering in the shed out back. Truro is the New Jersey real estate appraiser's second hometown; the weather-beaten old house was like a second home.  But erosion was taking its toll. In recent years, winter storms have breached the dunes so often at Ballston Beach that the sand is now leveled, leaving a flattened, refuse-strewn alien beachscape at the head of the Pamet River. That breach in the dunes left the Moore/Musnuff home vulnerable not just from the east, but the north.  By 2018, one corner of the house was suspended in mid-air. There was so little land left that retreat — the term people here reluctantly use to describe moving inland, away from the ocean — was not much of an option. By the time the home was demolished in 2018, it was teetering on a shabby patch of dune barely bigger than its own footprint.  “It was a hard thing to watch,"" Musnuff said. But a lifetime of summers on the Cape was worth the heartache, he said.  “It's a marvelous place to be. All you've got to do is see it."" Since the 1950s, the clam shack nestled in the dunes of Nauset Beach in Orleans had been the place to go. The weathered old building wore a long stretch of sand and beachgrass like a rumpled apron. There was plenty of space for a dozen or so forest green picnic tables and matching umbrellas, offering a little shade and a place to enjoy an extra thick milkshake before plunging back into the surf.  Liam's was a place steeped in childhood memories: racing through the sand, bathing suit still dripping from the sea, exchanging a few dollars for a plate of whole belly fried clams piled on a soft roll and a tangle of crisp, golden onion rings. John Ohman was 41 years old when he took over the lease of what had been called Philbrick's and renamed it for his newborn son. Ohman had already run two successful seafood restaurants in Dennis while his wife ran a third — Kate's, which still stands along Paine's Creek in Brewster. Soon, Liam's outshone all of them, and Ohman was its face. Cheerful and chatty — “my wife says I can talk 20 minutes to a wrong number"" — he greeted customers and rang the register, too busy to correct the visitors who assumed he was Liam. And the notion that the water was creeping ever closer to the building? The sea was so far away it barely crossed his mind. By the time Liam was 10, the boy was working at the restaurant that bore his name, standing on a milk crate behind the counter. Before he turned 20, he was in charge of the ice cream line, making milkshakes faster than anyone. On a busy day, when Liam's would sell hundreds of shakes, Liam had all nine spindles going at once.  But the ocean's advance had become impossible to ignore. The sand that stood between Liam's and the sea was shrinking. At school, Liam had learned about the ways that climate change was hastening erosion and intensifying winter storms that can cut away beach and dune in a few hours. At work, he could see it in action.  John Ohman saw it, too.  “It caused me sleepless nights,"" he said. “You always knew that you were at the mercy of Mother Nature there."" By 2017, John and Liam Ohman had heard from experts that they had perhaps 10 years before waves consumed the 80 feet of beach between the building and the sea. A decade might have gotten John to retirement. It might have been enough time to plan Liam's orderly retreat.  Then, on a Friday in March 2018, a nor'easter moved in. Storms batter the Cape every winter, and Ohman didn't give it much thought. Liam's was closed for the season, and Ohman was keeping an eye on things by occasionally checking a town webcam trained on the beach.  “It was a normal Friday,"" he said. “Everything seemed fine.""  But by Saturday, the storm had worsened. Waves at Nauset Beach swelled to over 20 feet high. While Ohman was picking up his younger son in Hyannis, the phone rang. It was a reporter from the Cape Cod Times.  “Have you been out to Liam's?"" Ohman recalled the reporter asking.  Ohman said that he hadn't.  “Well you better get here,"" the reporter said. “And fast.""  Ohman rushed to the beach. He watched the waves as they approached the dunes, surging closer and closer. Each swell seemed perfectly designed to slice away the sand that stood between Liam's and the sea. The old building withstood the storm, but its position was precarious. Ohman, halfway through a 10-year lease, hoped the town might move the building back, retreating to the inland side of the parking lot. Some experts agreed that would work for awhile.  But the town opted to tear it down, and three weeks after the storm, an excavator arrived to finish what the ocean had started. It clawed at the roof and walls, filling dumpsters with debris. A few signs and menus were visible in the wreckage: Salad rolls. Seafood baskets. Curly fries.  John and Liam Ohman had not been back since. The idea was painful, and they still harbor hard feelings toward the town. But on a windy Tuesday in June, they pulled up in John's red pickup, LIAMS on the license plate. Together, they paced off the path through the dunes, zeroing in on the specific places they'd spent so many hours working here, side by side. At the top of the dune, near the bench where the line for milkshakes used to form, they took a photo together.  The tide was low. The waves were calm. The ocean felt very far away. The Cape can seem as thick with scientists as ice cream stands. From its southwestern tip in Woods Hole — a world center for environmental science — to the sprawling National Seashore, researchers come to study nature's wonders and warning signs. Few are better known here than Graham Giese, who 43 years ago cofounded the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown. Eighty-seven years old, with a tangle of white hair that spends a lot of time stuffed into a faded ballcap, Giese has a way of explaining geological concepts as if he is puzzling out how these things work for the first time with you, waving his long arms excitedly and telling you what a smart question you just asked. (It wasn't.)  Erosion is deceptively complex. Energy from waves shifts sediment in every direction, often all at once, and if you could stand on the ocean floor and see each grain of sand with perfect clarity, it might look like a blizzard. But over time, patterns emerge. Waves slice away sand from the dunes and bluffs, the earth receding in a way that's almost imperceptible until one day your restaurant is in danger or your house is about to fall off a cliff.  Giese, who has studied the charts and maps drawn by men who stalked these shores long before satellites orbited overhead, understands these patterns as well as anyone. In the 1960s, he was part of a team of scientists who proposed that the geologic origin of Provincetown's signature hook was tied to Georges Bank, a vast plateau under the sea 60 miles off the Cape's southeast coast.  Along the Outer Cape, eroding sand from beaches and dunes is distributed by waves coming from two directions: The waves that roll in off the Gulf of Maine push sand south, while swells arriving from the open ocean off the southeast coast push sand north.  Ocean waves are much more powerful than anything that wind in the gulf can produce, but their strength has long been blunted by Georges Bank, which acts as a sort of invisible breakwater.  Once water began to creep over Georges Bank 6,000 years ago, waves began to push sand north until it collected at the Cape's now-familiar northern tip. It was a slow, steady process, undisturbed by human intervention. The water over Georges Bank deepened only imperceptibly at first. But it is a massive force today. The rising seas allow more powerful waves to pass over it relatively unimpeded, overpowering what had been a delicate balance with the waves that arrive from the gulf.  The result, Giese and others discovered, is that erosion rates on the Outer Cape are now nearly double what they had been for thousands of years. And the same phenomenon of water propelling sand that helped build the Cape we know has been almost weaponized by sea level rise, prematurely dooming places like Liam's. Wave after wave, the submergence of Georges Bank is revealed in the water. You can see it if you look closely, and for a very long time.  It is visible with special clarity if you are Dave Spang. “Right now,"" Spang says, reading the surf's fingerprint of height, angle, and interval, “these swells are coming in from the open ocean.""  As his wife, Gwen, peers out to sea through a pair of binoculars, Spang retreats into the shack and records the day's data in a thick three-ring binder, just as he's done again and again before.  Every few months, he enters the data into a laptop charged by solar panels on the shed. About twice a year, he walks the laptop back to civilization and uploads the data where scientists like Giese can use it to study a massive global crisis. As they make their way back along the trail they've walked countless times, the Spangs talk about the way climate change is shaping, altering, and threatening the Cape; it is a conversation that slips too easily into fatalism. Gwen Spang says she is glad to have lived her life already, so she won't have to see what comes next.  A winged Ambassador The elegant shorebird, with its curved needle beak, racing stripe above the eye, and the long legs of a wader, picked its way through Loagy Bay salt marsh in Wellfleet, plucking fiddler crabs from their finger-thick burrows in the mud. It was a whimbrel, a seasonal Cape visitor with a story to tell, and Brad Winn was watching. Winn steered his kayak behind the tall reeds a year ago this month and waited, perfectly still. His trap was set; all that was left to do was wait.  Salt marshes exude a particular stillness, but up close they are a hive of activity, and this one is no different. Tidal waters rush in and out from Cape Cod Bay under a single lane bridge, filling and draining the scores of serpentine creeks. At low tide, damp cordgrass dotted with horseshoe crab shells stretches for hundreds of yards in every direction. Soft breezes touch off cascading ripples of action in the water, the grass, the birds.  Marshes are home to their own complex ecology, each organism and element interacting in delicate balance. Their importance extends far beyond the cordgrass, to life both on land and under the sea. At a level that can be difficult to see, everything is interconnected.  But those lifelines are breaking. It takes thousands of years for a salt marsh like this one to arrange itself, growing slowly taller and moving gradually inland.  Now they are beginning to vanish under the rising sea, taking with them — among many things — what draws the whimbrels here.  Winn, director of shorebird habitat management at Manomet, an environmental nonprofit in Plymouth, had learned a lot by watching these birds — their migration, their habitat, their food, and the places they roost and mate.  By watching them so closely, Winn and his colleagues can catch a glimpse of nearly everything that is so important about this place, and everything that is at risk. The information they collect will help other scientists at Manomet and around the world as they try to preserve these precious places.  “This bird,“ Winn said, “is an ambassador for the health of a larger system.""  For whimbrels, these marshes are an important annual stop along a migration that traverses the globe; for people, the marsh is at least as critical — even if we never set foot in one.  Finally, the bird stepped into Winn's trap. A small loop of filament snagged its slender leg — and Winn pounced, whisking the bird out of the marsh and into the back seat of his car, where he and colleague Alan Kneidel measured him, banded him, and used teflon ribbons to affix a tiny, solar-powered transmitter to the bird's hip bone. Its antenna can send location data back to Manomet about once a day.  The researchers named the whimbrel Ahanu — a word common in some Native American languages that means “he laughs."" Winn and his team would spend the next year waiting patiently, as scientists must, watching as Ahanu winged across the hemisphere, and wondering whether he'd return. Beyond the birders, few in the human horde that descends each year on the Cape come for the marshes — Great Marsh in Barnstable, the Sippewissett in Falmouth, Nauset in Eastham, and so many others. But the marshes are no less important for being overlooked.  Many of the sport fish we catch and eat spend their early lives here, where baitfish and shellfish are plentiful. The marshes filter pollutants that would otherwise seep into the sea. They serve as a buffer when storms roll in, protecting homes built along the uplands. And they are a remarkably effective check on the forces driving climate change, trapping carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere 55 times more efficiently than tropical rainforest, according to Mass Audubon.  But these wetlands can no longer keep pace with the water. They grow atop vast beds of decomposing plant matter — carbon they've sequestered for centuries. But the process is slow, and the marshes can no longer grow taller fast enough to stay above the rising sea. At the same time, too many houses, yards, and entire neighborhoods on the Cape block the marshes' inland march. The result is that the area known as the low marsh, covered and uncovered by the tides, is slipping further and further underwater. Land that is now high marsh — rarely submerged, home to many plant and animal species — is converting itself into low marsh.  Already, the ecosystems here are showing symptoms of other stresses — carefully balanced connections thrown off kilter. In Wellfleet, at the mouth of the Herring River, swaths of cordgrass growing along the water's edge are missing large patches, denuded down to the bare earth like craters. These bald spots in what should be a thriving wetland ecosystem are the work of nocturnal purple marsh crabs, which feast on the soft grasses overnight.  Marsh crabs are native to the Cape, but in recent years their populations have multiplied. Today, their numbers are about 10 times normal. Scientists suspect the purple marsh crab boom may be caused by a decline in the crab's predators, including Atlantic cod and striped bass — species whose decline on the Cape has been hastened by climate change.  The result is a destructive feedback loop — one change causing another and another that in turn reinforces and deepens the first. Weakened by the crabs eating away the plants that help bind the soil, sections of marsh could easily collapse into the water in a single storm — 2,000 years of growth gone in a day.  As the sea continues to rise, the smaller marsh that remains will not capture carbon as well as it had; it will not protect the uplands from storm tides as well, or be as bountiful a nursery for young fish. And the loop will begin again.  “The changes are subtle. It becomes obvious when you look at aerial photography over time,"" said Stephen Smith, a plant ecologist with the Cape Cod National Seashore who studies the marsh. “Essentially there will be a lot less or even no vegetation."" From the air, Loagy Bay must look like a buffet to a passing whimbrel. They are late summer Cape Codders, and for about a month, they spend their days feasting on fiddler crabs in the salt marshes and their nights roosting on sandbars far from predators. Once they've eaten their fill — enough to nearly double their body weight — they make the long-distance flight to their South American winter homes in a single shot.  Whimbrels make good subjects for researchers like Winn. They are large for shorebirds, more than a foot long, and sturdy enough to fly thousands of miles at a clip. That makes them representative of some 50 species of shorebirds that spend at least some of their year in the United States. And these remarkable creatures, it turns out, can tell us an awful lot about the health of our coasts. Here, the whimbrel's success or failure is tied to the complex ecology of the Cape.  “We're limited in what we can see in the world — in what we can interpret and understand,"" said Winn. “But with birds, the tie-in is very direct."" Year-in and year-out, whimbrels make the same stops along their migratory path up and down the Western Hemisphere, each location suited to the bird's particular needs: Brazilian mangroves; wetlands south of Freeport, Texas; the breeding grounds in Canada's Northwest Territories; the marshes of Hudson Bay and Wellfleet.  This is the path Ahanu traveled, and to see it on a map of the world is almost unbelievable, Winn said.  Ahanu will see more of the world than most people ever do, and Winn has tagged along on that journey since the day the bird was flapping around in the back seat of his car.  Ahanu's journey — and his species' survival — depends on the health of the environment at each of his carefully selected landing spots. Everything is connected, not just on the Cape but around the world.  Every year, Ahanu writes those connections across the sky. There are other storytellers winging the Cape skies, feeding off its bounty, and occasionally wandering into a scientist's snare.  Consider the yellow-shafted northern flicker, a woodpecker common on the Cape. In museum collections from decades ago, the birds' flight feathers are consistently yellow. But these days, many yellow-shafted flickers' signature feathers are turning orange or even red.  Ornithologists assumed this was due to cross-breeding with the red-shafted flicker, a subspecies more often found west of the Rocky Mountains. But recent research points in another direction entirely: As non-native plants have proliferated in a warming New England, the yellow-shafted flickers are now feasting on the berries of invasive honeysuckle bushes that only arrived in the Northeast once the climate warmed.  The flickers' feathers are easy to see, but some of the most severe consequences of climate change for landbirds can be much harder to spot. At Manomet, the environmental nonprofit where Winn studies whimbrels, data show blue jays returning to the region earlier over the last several decades as the world warms, from a median arrival date of May 16 in the 1970s to May 5 between 2010 and 2015. It is a subtle shift in migration patterns that can have devastating consequences.  “There comes a point at which you have a complete ecological mismatch,"" said Trevor Lloyd-Evans, director of Manomet's landbird conservation program. Birds arrive at times when the insects they eat are in short supply; birds breed too late and can't find food for their young.  “The stage we're at now is that instead of maybe raising four young, they're raising perhaps three young,"" Lloyd-Evans said. Overall landbird bandings at Manomet are down 50 percent since 1970, a trend conservation efforts have thankfully leveled off.  To experience the difference in a place like Wellfleet, where the pitch pine and oak forests once echoed with the familiar whistle of wood thrushes, you have to look not just up into the branches and the blue sky beyond, but back into the past.  Only then will you realize that these woods are quieter by half. One year after trapping the visiting whimbrel, Winn was waiting on Ahanu again. It was getting late in the season: Would the far-flung wayfarer return? “The bird will make the judgment,"" he said, “if birds do that."" If Ahanu did not return, it would not necessarily mean much about the Cape. You can only learn so much from a single bird's path. But it would be a disappointment — and maybe a worrisome hint.  Then, one day in August, Ahanu took flight.  The tracking information showed him launching from Hudson Bay and flying over the coast of Nova Scotia, out over the open ocean. But just as he appeared to curve ever so slightly south, the signal stopped.  The tracker strapped to Ahanu's hip communicates with a satellite that only receives signals when it's in the right position — five hours of data, then about a day off-line. So Winn and his team waited, sitting in suspense, as a whimbrel and a satellite, both high overhead, traversed the globe.  Finally, it was time: Winn fired up his computer and had a hit: Ahanu had arrived in Massachusetts, but he'd flown right past the Cape. He hooked around and passed back over Martha's Vineyard, finally alighting on the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge on the Cape's southeastern tip. Sunday dawned. The sun was not up yet when Winn first checked his screen. Ahanu's path on the map ended in the place they had all hoped it would: Loagy Bay, the same marsh where Winn first glimpsed the bird. By dawn the next day, Winn was there in his kayak. It took only a few minutes to spot Ahanu, a bright green flag strapped to his bony leg, the antenna that told his story protruding just beyond his tail feathers.  There is still a place for birds like Ahanu on the Cape. His travels here are in part a testament to the important conservation work being done on the Cape, Winn said — the refuge in Monomoy where he spends his nights and the Mass Audubon-owned marsh in Wellfleet where he eats all day.  It is not too late to save the marsh. But imagine, if you can, a day when the whimbrels and other shorebirds stop arriving at the Cape. One day, a migratory bird like Ahanu, soaring 1,000 feet above the sea, will look down in search of the marshy margins and sandy spits that made his globetrotting life possible and see only water. And he will fly right by. “Once they're gone"" Erick Scherer made his living at night.  Kneeling against the railing of his specially outfitted aluminum boat, powerful halogen lamps trained on the water, Scherer plunged his sharp-tined steel rake into the shallows along Cape Cod's shores again and again.  He turned the rake in a big circle at low tide, combing the bottom of a rivulet between two sandbars and hauling up with each pass dozens of wriggling, silver fish called sand lances. Striped bass followed him wherever he went, gobbling the fish that slipped off Scherer's rake. The sand lance is lunch for all manner of marine life, and some birds, too. But they also make perfect bait, and fetched Scherer about $5 a pound at shops around the Cape. On a good night, the four-hour shift that low tide allowed would yield several hundred pounds of sand lances. Scherer named his one-man business for both the fish he caught and the hours he toiled, when most of the world rested: Sandman.  The work was exhausting. The rake weighed over 100 pounds, and he'd comb the sand with it 1,000 times a night, wrecking his shoulders, elbows and hands. But it paid well enough for Scherer to spend $80,000 for his boat, a truck, and the rest of his equipment. It didn't make Scherer rich, but it put food on the table.  Then, one summer about 10 years ago, the sand lances got hard to find. His typical catch was cut in half. Then it was a third. Scherer kept trying, but the rakes weren't turning up fish anymore — certainly not in big enough numbers to make a living.  “I had to get rid of the boat, I had to get rid of the truck,"" Scherer said. Sandman “kind of died a horrible death at the end."" Scherer wondered if it was his fault: Had he and the other two sand lance specialists who frequented the shores taken too many? Maybe it was just a dry spell for a species — still found flitting around the waters off the Cape today — that is notoriously boom-and-bust.  The limited sand lance research that exists cannot fully explain Scherer's experience. But scientists, who say these tiny fish deserve a lot more study, believe they are vulnerable to the changing climate.  Ten years later, Scherer wonders if what he saw was actually a warning — a sign that the sea was in trouble. Erick Scherer was on to something. Whatever happened to the sand lances, the warming world is wreaking havoc on ocean ecosystems, touching off a cascade of disruptions that are rippling across species.  And in the waters closest to the Cape, the effects have been disturbing and profound. Melting arctic ice is pumping fresh water into the ocean around Greenland and weakening an ancient current that pulses cold water down the East Coast. With that cold water spigot turned down, a surge of warm water that travels north from the tropics is increasingly encroaching on the Gulf of Maine, the basin of the Atlantic whose southern boundary is marked by the Cape.  For thousands of years, this frigid, 36,000-square-mile bathtub was home to countless cold-water creatures. But in recent years, it has been warming faster than 99 percent of the world's oceans. Species that are able, including lobsters, are seeking more hospitable waters, touching off a great undersea migration. But those that cannot move or adapt must suffer through marine heat waves and contend with an unfamiliar ocean that is also more acidic and, because warmer water holds less gas, less oxygenated — trends whose consequences scientists are only beginning to understand.
