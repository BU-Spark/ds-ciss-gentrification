All in all, im pretty disappointed because CR is advertised extensively and has the image of being this amazing utopia. I came here to immerse myself with my broken Spanish and love for Central American food and people.

All I found here is a bunch of foreigners, let’s just say light skinned eh? Who have pura vida tattoos and a drinking problem on the coastal areas and adrenaline junkies on the other parts. 

The Ticos don’t seem to happy with the likes of these, and I get it, I wouldn’t be either considering again, that im Indian and I know what it feels like when a bunch of white people come to my country and make everything expensive and inaccessible to locals at the same time being patronizing. 

The gentrification here is driving me nuts and I don’t know how the Ticos deal. Then I see posts about some more Gringos wanting to move here for good and putting the housing market through the grater for locals just as it’s ruined in their “first world” economies.

I guess this is just a rant, just to say, beautiful country, filled with great locals, hope you get to retain your country and culture, hope you can afford to live comfortably.

I know it's kinda frowned upon to self-promote on reddit, and I really haven't before but I've poured the last 5 years of my heart, passion, and creativity into this album and while the press hasn't really come through for us on this release, I'm confident that y'all beautiful people can help us get some streams.

For those new to our sound, we've been compared to the likes of Turkuaz and Thumpasaurus and have been described as Zappa meets OutKast. The new album is campy horror allegory with Lovecraftian imagery and ferocious rap-rock tones. If you want to dip your toe in I'd suggest the tracks: Multi-Dimensional Space Kraken, Spooky Food, Gentrification of Planet Earth, or Abortable Housing.

Thanks for listening and if you're in Austin we're playing our release/farewell show at Parish tonight at 8pm.

Me personally?

I believe behaviour will follow thought, follow how we think.

Dublin definitely has a ""folksy"" charm, but if there were a way to maintain the common-people approachability of that, whilst improving its glamor?

Bear with me:

[https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/795820101](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/795820101)

In theory this general ideology may be an example of what I mean, as it embodies a certain fun social component, but with an element of glamour to ensure standards don't deteriorate.

I think implementing such a societal ""thought paradigm"" would require improved AGS activity, but then of course that's already in the works.

More around the clock security, but of course with the reformed licencing laws, punters are staying out all night now anyway.

Additionally, as anti-social behavior is in many respects, bitches looking for attention (i.e. the non-progressive side to society looking for attention/validation in the face of the progressive side), **introduction or elevation in standard of a societal trade that facilitates learning of how to adequately manage that behaviour**

i.e. how to f\*\*k bitches.

Could revolutionize the ethos of the entire city, maybe even half the country.

It’s also highly unfair for the working class people because we barely can afford living in Gent but the hipsters and gentrifiers can settle down anywhere from Sint Pieters to Muide… and the city is doing NOTHING to counter this inequality.

Others were here for different reasons. “This is matter of equity”, says Kim, an activist from the south end.  Asked to elaborate she emphasized the loss of parking lots raised equity issues. 

Jim, unemployed from Wellesley spoke about the warehouses. “There was a whole community that gathered here. People see dilapidated buildings but it was more than that”. A child of the 80s, he continued “the condo developers can’t be stopped with a montage. This is real life”.

Homes are being purchase by non-owner occupants at a greater clip than ever before. This is coupled with the disruption of work that has occurred during the pandemic seems to be escalating migratory patterns. Just like people in my city are getting priced out of their preferred neighborhoods pushing them to buy in adjacent lower income neighborhoods. 

All of this said I feel it is inevitable that this is going to happen to West Virginia. 

I would like to start a conversation from West Virginians about how this is already affecting them and also what people thinking about moving to WV in the next decade could be mindful of in order to not be part of the problem.

I'm writing a story set in a fantasy world in which technology, science and philosophy is similar to Renaissance Italy. Magic competes with technology. My main characters need to gain political support from the city council, dominated by 2 or 3 ""historical"" factions and a rising corporation. This support is needed to officially investigate against an ally that may be ready to betray them, stipulating a treaty with a common enemy to invade and conquer this rich city and its possessions. People in the city council have their own reasons to want to shut down the investigation not to bother their commerce, or to want a war with the former ally to boost their power. 

About the rising corporation, at first i thought about the wool merchants (Medici in Florence were part of the wool corporation), but i still can change it. It can be whatever speculative bubble that works in my story.

So, i would like to describe the ""wool corporation neighborhood"" as an area inhabited by new riches who kick working class out. How can I describe it?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/sdii06/land_and_lawsuits_anzaroots_botched_bet_on/,Land and Lawsuits - Anzaroot's Botched Bet on Baseball - The gentrification of Henry St.,"Don’t read too far into the title. Trying to have a little fun. Incoming lower effort post. 

Here are a few things I observed that tie into previous conversations about housing, gentrification, and slumlords that I consider interesting.

Isaac Anzaroot (MEJA Group LLC) recently purchased 6 properties from Faisal Afify (Pharaoh Group LLC) in August 2021. In previous observations, Anzaroot has purchased a number of properties from Afify over the last few years. 3 of these properties from the latest purchase are located on Henry St., accounting for 83 units. All of these units are currently empty. 

The Henry St properties are already being auctioned off beginning January 31st. The auction listing is titled [University/Stadium District Housing](https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/University-Stadium-District-Housing/22723425/). I interpret this as the beginning phase in the gentrification of the Henry St. & Pine St. neighborhoods. I think that is a common concern from residents in that neighborhood ever since the City announced plans for the [Stadium District Master Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8c6OYSJoBOmaDPqe-tjmRsqZWVrOecY/view?usp=sharing). It’s interesting to see the initial benefactors of such proposals. Additionally, witnessing the early movements is concerning/interesting! 

[ Stadium District Master Plan](https://preview.redd.it/glc9d202y3e81.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=5586230c81136fdaf0dc85913303144d7bc9c60a)

It gets slightly more interesting when we see that Anzaroot filed a lawsuit on 11/5/21 against Afify for $3,000,000 in damages.

>“The nature of this action is Breach of Contract, Fraud, Tortious Interference, Slander, Deceptive Business Practices, Compel the Determination of a Claim to Real Property, and for Specific Performance.

So, someone got burned, or is claiming to have been burned. Other than that I have no idea what is going on there.

A Conversation With Sociologist Dimitrios Liokaftos","Psychedelic use is no longer a relatively small, counterculture phenomenon. Indeed, by microdosing, tech workers and many career strivers seem to be infusing psychedelics into the brave, new, somewhat middle class and much larger world of social and professional ladder climbing.

Microdosing is defined as the regular use of a psychedelic drug (a/k/a hallucinogen) at amounts so tiny as to be impossible to consciously perceive. This generally translates into 1/10 – 1/20 of a recreational dose. Many enthusiasts swear by microdosing’s positive effect on mood, insight, and creativity. Studies that rely on self-reporting have tended to bolster such anecdotal claims, but other evidence suggests that the effects of microdosing are illusory. For example, in one double-blind study, microdosing improved users’ mood, energy, and creativity — but so did the placebo.

I’ve recently been reading a lot about how thrifting and sustainability in general have become gentrified, making it a trendy lifestyle for white wealthy people while simultaneously raising prices in thrift stores, etc. making it inaccessible to poorer people who need to thrift. Examples that are frequently given are wealthy people shopping at goodwill or value village and making prices go up, or teens buying XL pants just to take in the waste later (taking sizes away from those who need the bigger size). 

Personally i’m torn on this issue, because i’m a huge advocate for thrifting and sustainability, and I think everyone should make an effort to switch over if possible. But, I also see their points and realize it’s a valid issue.

https://www.reddit.com/r/hobart/comments/lu4hsq/gentrification_of_salamanca_destruction_of_the/,"Gentrification of Salamanca & Destruction of the ""night time economy""","I suppose this is a bit of a vent. I suppose you could say Salamanca gentrified first in the 90s, and this is just another wave. I suppose, as I have said before, that I just don't fit in here anymore, but...

Seeing Syrup/the Knopwood's building being turned into a (very expensive) ""boutique hotel"" utterly depresses me. Reading about it, and how the developer took great joy in ripping out the DJ booth, and the bar (obviously they had a few bad nights there, to take such glee in destroying something people enjoyed...), is even worse. It's an utter slap in the face to anyone who enjoyed a night out there, or perhaps even met someone there, and enjoyed a brief moment of company. ""You're not our clientele anymore, and we don't give a shit about you, OR what you think"", basically sums it up.

Sure, it wasn't my favourite club/s, and my friends thought the place was lame, but... We don't even HAVE that many clubs left, and that was at least a decent one, for a while, after I turned 18. Why the eff couldn't they at least leave us that?

Iso is gone (I know it was of debatable quality, but still, I had fun). The 24 hour bakehouse is now fucking San Churro's. (Bar)Celona is now generic hipstery/Melbourne blandness. The vast majority of new Salamanca joints are just samey-same pricey hipster eateries. The Tele is up for sale, likely to developers... The Theatre Royal Hotel is gone, thanks to UTAS, as is so much of the small business fabric of the CBD.

It's just fucking sad, man. You'd think we could at least have kept Salamanca as our fun, greasy, night-out spot, surely? But no, clearly those buildings are ""worth too much"", and must be turned into yet more apartments and bloody ""hip"" hotels and bars with the same decorations... And the pubs that didn't ""gentrify"" quick enough, and weren't heritage listed? Well they're all bloody gone now, in the city itself.

I just... I don't really see much remaining of the cultural fabric of the city I grew up in. The buildings are largely still there (even if the industry isn't), and some restaurants are hanging on, but... Despite some of you saying ""how many new bars there are"" (hint: fewer than before, just of a very different type), I just... Feel like this place has less and less to ""offer"" young people, aside from festivals, markets and work. In terms of the things that might actually attract a Tasmanian to stick around, long-term, and the things that... Made the place vibrant for so long? I'm seeing less and less of that, these days. There's fewer and fewer places to go, on a Friday or Saturday night, that aren't a) ridiculously overpriced, or b) exactly the same. And that was the case even before the pandemic fucked everything, and has been... Probably for at least the past 5 years or so, when UTAS basically decided ""fuck education, we're going to become a real estate developer""...

But, from what I've seen, it clearly suits some of you on this sub. And that's fine. But this Tasmanian, born and bred..? I'm just not sure there's that much here, for me, anymore. And as sad as that makes me..? I'm not sure there's that much point in sticking around, long-term, in a city whose formerly working-class ""soul"" (or what is left of it, at least) no longer suits me.",[''],"['Salamanca', '&', 'Destruction', 'of']",ThylacineDevil,2021-02-28 09:02:34

That ethnic list does not really say upper middle class to me.

As far as i can tell there is a large immigrant population that lives in the least expensive housing, pressing up the prices of the less expensive places. Which probably propagates up through the housing system.

So in short it seems to me that there is a lot of people who wants inexpensive housing, which drives up the prices all the way up. Rather than a lot of affluent middle class people driving the price hike from the top.

Started blocking off the main village and have built a gazebo over the lake, with shelves for storage for weary visitors not far from the yacht.  Expansions expected even though the locals DO NOT like me taking over. It’s fine as their skulls make for glorious illumination at night. 

For weary travelers just off the plane, no need to worry. A quaint safety zone awaits with a treehouse walled off for those scared to explore. 

Up the hill from the plane is a turtle track that leads to the main village... perfect for those looking for more of a guided tour/jurassic park feel. 

If you are feeling adventurous, there are about 7 zones now complete with all you need to start your own town.

My own feeling on it is that it is necessary in a growing city. Take stoneybatter or ringsend, while a portion of the area remains as social housing, they are now safer places and anti social behaviour can be tackled.

Automation is coming. We already know that technology and automation is going to replace tons and tons of working Americans. But I think Yang we should also talk about how wealthy high earning tech employees (that are making these technology) are driving out tons and tons of working class and middle class people from cities, like San Francisco Bay Area, where rent is on average 3.6K/month for a 1 bedroom. 

Tech companies are also spreading to other major cities and increasing the rent prices there as well. This is a serious topic I hope Yang can bring in order to further prove the reasoning for a UBI.

https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/7jikrs/the_impending_gentrification_of_catsacks/,The impending gentrification of Catsacks,"Like many of you I started a new embark to try out the new systems recently. Untamed, plenty of limonite. It's about year five so it has got to the point that I'm able to put things in for the sake of decoration and flavour, and not just survival. But I did have to improvise a few things, and it's one of these improvisations that my wife has taken umbrage with.  
The main issue I've been having is that there are too many children. Nearly 20 percent of the 110 dwarves currently occupying catsacks. The Nobles have been fine, pleasant even. They like bolts and backpacks. Easy demands. So my ire had fallen on the truly workshy, those of age 0-12. Everyone else has a nice home 5x5 minimum, most 9x9, but the children live in the ""Orphan pit"". Its the only non stone room. A dirt floor. 5 beds between 25 children. Named after the high probability that they will become orphans, rather than that they are.  
I also have the ""Canaries"". A squad to keep the kids busy and who are responsible for checking if parts of the cavern are safe. They often aren't. Despite many countries making use of child soldiers this so appalled said wife that I now have to redesign the child ""care"" system.  
The replacement system? An educational dwarven nursery called Tinybeards. I like that they'll get other noncombat skills from the toys, and I'll put in a fermented fruit juice bar (kids drink booze right?), But this is all sounding a bit less fun than the current system.  
What I need help with is what else I can do with these useless kids to make it more fun/Fun? I don't want them all just sitting around eating mashed plump-helmet toast. Any ideas?
