I know it's kinda frowned upon to self-promote on reddit, and I really haven't before but I've poured the last 5 years of my heart, passion, and creativity into this album and while the press hasn't really come through for us on this release, I'm confident that y'all beautiful people can help us get some streams.

For those new to our sound, we've been compared to the likes of Turkuaz and Thumpasaurus and have been described as Zappa meets OutKast. The new album is campy horror allegory with Lovecraftian imagery and ferocious rap-rock tones. If you want to dip your toe in I'd suggest the tracks: Multi-Dimensional Space Kraken, Spooky Food, Gentrification of Planet Earth, or Abortable Housing.

Thanks for listening and if you're in Austin we're playing our release/farewell show at Parish tonight at 8pm.

However I read this paper which says that there are cases where by integrating more green spaces in localised areas, the market price of the area increases which polarizes the affordability and therefore displaces communities.

The true Gentenaars don’t need a yoga studio or a expensive coffeeshop or a ultraliberal bookshop… especially not in the historically working class neighbourhoods that i’ve mentioned above. 

It’s also highly unfair for the working class people because we barely can afford living in Gent but the hipsters and gentrifiers can settle down anywhere from Sint Pieters to Muide… and the city is doing NOTHING to counter this inequality. While in other cities like Brussels and Antwerp many working class and POC people live in the centre, here in Gent we are mostly forced to live on the outer ring.","['Opinions/complaints', 'on']",['Gent'],gentrification of Gent,ultramegagigagangsta,2022-11-14 01:03:20

Karen, a vegan from Somerville is appalled by the  environmental damage. “There was a whole habitat of plants and animals living in the old parking lots” she said, “and now it’s gone”.

Others were here for different reasons. “This is matter of equity”, says Kim, an activist from the south end.  Asked to elaborate she emphasized the loss of parking lots raised equity issues. 

Jim, unemployed from Wellesley spoke about the warehouses. “There was a whole community that gathered here. People see dilapidated buildings but it was more than that”. A child of the 80s, he continued “the condo developers can’t be stopped with a montage. This is real life”.

Among these protesters an unlikely ally. Luis a father of four and construction worker from Revere. “I just went to get coffee” he says, “can I go back to work?” , highlighting the displacement felt by the POC community.","['Activists', 'decry']",['seaport'],gentrification of seaport,anurodhp,2021-12-09 18:38:26

I'm writing a story set in a fantasy world in which technology, science and philosophy is similar to Renaissance Italy. Magic competes with technology. My main characters need to gain political support from the city council, dominated by 2 or 3 ""historical"" factions and a rising corporation. This support is needed to officially investigate against an ally that may be ready to betray them, stipulating a treaty with a common enemy to invade and conquer this rich city and its possessions. People in the city council have their own reasons to want to shut down the investigation not to bother their commerce, or to want a war with the former ally to boost their power. 

About the rising corporation, at first i thought about the wool merchants (Medici in Florence were part of the wool corporation), but i still can change it. It can be whatever speculative bubble that works in my story.

So, i would like to describe the ""wool corporation neighborhood"" as an area inhabited by new riches who kick working class out. How can I describe it?

A Conversation With Sociologist Dimitrios Liokaftos","Psychedelic use is no longer a relatively small, counterculture phenomenon. Indeed, by microdosing, tech workers and many career strivers seem to be infusing psychedelics into the brave, new, somewhat middle class and much larger world of social and professional ladder climbing.

Microdosing is defined as the regular use of a psychedelic drug (a/k/a hallucinogen) at amounts so tiny as to be impossible to consciously perceive. This generally translates into 1/10 – 1/20 of a recreational dose. Many enthusiasts swear by microdosing’s positive effect on mood, insight, and creativity. Studies that rely on self-reporting have tended to bolster such anecdotal claims, but other evidence suggests that the effects of microdosing are illusory. For example, in one double-blind study, microdosing improved users’ mood, energy, and creativity — but so did the placebo.

I’ve recently been reading a lot about how thrifting and sustainability in general have become gentrified, making it a trendy lifestyle for white wealthy people while simultaneously raising prices in thrift stores, etc. making it inaccessible to poorer people who need to thrift. Examples that are frequently given are wealthy people shopping at goodwill or value village and making prices go up, or teens buying XL pants just to take in the waste later (taking sizes away from those who need the bigger size). 

Personally i’m torn on this issue, because i’m a huge advocate for thrifting and sustainability, and I think everyone should make an effort to switch over if possible. But, I also see their points and realize it’s a valid issue.

For weary travelers just off the plane, no need to worry. A quaint safety zone awaits with a treehouse walled off for those scared to explore. 

Up the hill from the plane is a turtle track that leads to the main village... perfect for those looking for more of a guided tour/jurassic park feel.

Tech companies are also spreading to other major cities and increasing the rent prices there as well. This is a serious topic I hope Yang can bring in order to further prove the reasoning for a UBI.
