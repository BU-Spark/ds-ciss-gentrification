All in all, im pretty disappointed because CR is advertised extensively and has the image of being this amazing utopia. I came here to immerse myself with my broken Spanish and love for Central American food and people.

All I found here is a bunch of foreigners, let’s just say light skinned eh? Who have pura vida tattoos and a drinking problem on the coastal areas and adrenaline junkies on the other parts. 

The Ticos don’t seem to happy with the likes of these, and I get it, I wouldn’t be either considering again, that im Indian and I know what it feels like when a bunch of white people come to my country and make everything expensive and inaccessible to locals at the same time being patronizing. 

The gentrification here is driving me nuts and I don’t know how the Ticos deal. Then I see posts about some more Gringos wanting to move here for good and putting the housing market through the grater for locals just as it’s ruined in their “first world” economies.

I guess this is just a rant, just to say, beautiful country, filled with great locals, hope you get to retain your country and culture, hope you can afford to live comfortably.

I know it's kinda frowned upon to self-promote on reddit, and I really haven't before but I've poured the last 5 years of my heart, passion, and creativity into this album and while the press hasn't really come through for us on this release, I'm confident that y'all beautiful people can help us get some streams.

For those new to our sound, we've been compared to the likes of Turkuaz and Thumpasaurus and have been described as Zappa meets OutKast. The new album is campy horror allegory with Lovecraftian imagery and ferocious rap-rock tones. If you want to dip your toe in I'd suggest the tracks: Multi-Dimensional Space Kraken, Spooky Food, Gentrification of Planet Earth, or Abortable Housing.

Thanks for listening and if you're in Austin we're playing our release/farewell show at Parish tonight at 8pm.

In this post I have copied the first \~1/3 since it is about autism and the rest of the article is about mental illness (Freddie has bipolar).

The excerpt is long. I'm tempted to write a short summary so everyone can get the main idea, but I don't want to mess with Freddie's writing. If anyone would like a summary I will try.

[https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-gentrification-of-disability](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-gentrification-of-disability)

>When I was in my late 20s (early 2007 to mid 2009, maybe) I worked for the local public school district in my hometown. For the bulk of my time there I was in a special program for kids with severe emotional disturbance, which I’ve written about once or twice. But I worked in a number of capacities in those years, and for a little while I helped out in a conventional special ed classroom for the middle school. I guess you’d say I was a paraprofessional, just extra coverage when they needed it.  
>  
>In that class there were two boys who had autism which resulted in severe academic and social and communicative impairments. One of them was completely nonverbal and had been his entire life. As I understood it, he had never been capable of speaking or reading, could not dress himself, wore sanitary garments, could not go to the bathroom without assistance. He would occasionally screech very loudly, without clear cause. I believe these days he would be referred to as having Level Three autism, as defined by the DSM. He needed a lot of help, and though he was unable to complete what might conventionally be called academic work the school provided him with structure, support, and time during which his mother didn’t have to care for him. I met her on several occasions when she came to pick him up after school. She would sometimes talk about the difficulties of raising a disabled child in language that would be frowned on today, but I admired how frank and honest she was.  
>  
>She was really not a fan of the autism awareness community of the time. This was well before the “neurodiversity” movement and all of its habits. It was all about awareness, raising awareness, 5ks for awareness, bumper stickers for awareness. That was precisely what angered her the most. She said to me once, “What does awareness do for my kid? How does it help me?” Words to that effect. It was a good question, one I couldn’t answer. Today I don’t hear about awareness so much, but there’s still plenty of the basic disease of awareness thinking - the notion that what people who deal with a particular disability need is a vague positivity, that what every disabled person requires is the laurel of strangers condescendingly wishing them the best. Now, with the rise of neurodiversity and the notion that autism is only different, not worse, we are confronted with similar questions. When a mother struggles every day to care for someone who will likely never be able to care for himself, what value could it hold for her that his condition is called diversity, rather than disorder? What value can it have for him, who cannot speak to comment on the difference?  
>  
>I thought of that mother when I read about [the recent cancelation of an academic panel at Harvard](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/5/4/beth-israel-autism-panel-backlash/). It seems a panel of experts was slated to speak on the subject of how best to help those with autism. But as they planned to speak about treatment, about treating autism as a hindrance to be managed, the event was decried as “violently ableist” by Harvard activists and swiftly shut down. It’s worth looking at [the petition](https://www.change.org/p/demand-that-harvard-support-autistic-students?source_location=petitions_browse) that was organized as part of this effort. One part reads  
>  
>*Autism is a neurodevelopmental and neurobiological disability that is not treatable or curable. It is not an illness or disease and most importantly, it is not inherently negative. Autistic people at Harvard and globally have advocated in the face of ableism to defend ourselves from such hateful, eugenicist logic.*  
>  
>This is, I think, nonsensical. It asserts that autism is a disability, a dis-ability, but also that it’s not an illness, a disease, or inherently negative. But the very concept of disability depends on the notion that disabilities are inherently negative. If they are not in some sense disabling, the term has no meaning. What’s more, the entire moral and legal logic that underpins the concept of reasonable accommodation - the affordances we make for people with disabilities, mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act - depends on the idea that these things are both unchosen and harmful. If they’re not, then there’s no communal obligation to accommodate them. What would they even need accommodation *for*?  
>  
>More, though, I cannot comprehend the arrogance of the woman who led the charge against the panel at Harvard, Kris King, to sit on her perch at the most exclusive university in the world and declare for the entire autistic community what autism is and means. It’s unsurprising that she’s disdainful of the need for treatment, given that she’s so high-functioning that she’s flourishing at an Ivy League university. She will never live the life that mother I knew lived. She will likely never care for someone whose autism has devastated them, robbed them of their ability to have conventional human relationships, to have a career, to be in love. Such debilitated people and their families will never have the cultural influence of a self-promoting Harvard student and so they’re simply read out of the conversation. Meanwhile autism activists and advocates make sweeping pronouncements about the lives of people they don’t know and could never understand.  
>  
>“Autistic people at Harvard and globally have advocated in the face of ableism to defend ourselves,” she writes. In fact, Ms. King, globally there are millions of people whose autism ensures they can’t advocate at all. Spare a thought for them, while you’re busy framing your diploma.  
>  
>In the years that followed my brief employment at the school district, the ideology that led to people like King was born. In the early 2010s there was a flurry of interest in autism. Dozens of books and hundreds of essays were written about autism, almost all of which talked about it as a set of valuable personality quirks rather than as a disorder. In article after ponderous article, autism was described as a newer, perhaps better way of thinking, sometimes even a “new evolution” for the human species. Always, always, always, this navel-gazing fixated relentlessly on the highest-functioning people with autism. You could read tens of thousands of words in this genre without ever once being informed about the *existence* of those whose autism debilitates them. Whenever I read yet another article talking about how some high-achieving computer scientist saw their autism as the key to their success, I would think of those whose autism has prevented them from enjoying all manner of elements of human life. Where were those people in all of that hype? Will Tyler Cowen ever write a book about them? Are they ever going to appear on the cover of *Forbes* magazine or whatever the fuck? No. They have been replaced; in their stead, we have members of the striving classes whose autism has never prevented them from flourishing at everything they’ve ever tried. And since “autism is not a disorder” has become the enforced opinion, those whose autism plainly *is* a disorder have to be marginalized - by the very people who complain about the marginalization of the “neurodiverse.” Autism has been gentrified.  
>  
>This is a dynamic I now cannot stop seeing: once a human attribute like autism or mental illness becomes seen as an identity marker that is useful for social positioning among the chattering class, the conversation about that attribute inevitably becomes fixated on those among that chattering class. It becomes impossible to escape their immense social gravity. The culture of that attribute becomes distorted and bent towards the interests and biases of those who enjoy the privilege of holding society’s microphone. Because you must be able to effectively communicate to take part in the conversation, and because all of the usual privileges of class and circumstance influence whose voice sounds the loudest, the discussion becomes just another playground for college-educated urbanites. To speak you must be able to speak, literally, and you must also enjoy the privileges of communicative competence and educated-class signaling mechanisms. So we will always tend toward a conversation that defaults to the interests of the least afflicted. This is inevitable; it’s baked into the system.  
>  
>We could overcome this problem if the people in the arena were dedicated to fronting (excuse me, “centering”) the interests of the most afflicted. But we can’t have that. We can’t have that because contemporary disability ideology is obsessively fixated on telling people to center themselves. That is perceived to be the entirety of the work: every individual with a disability must demand that the world sees them as “valid,” that they are just as authentically disabled as anyone else, that their ADHD grants them perfectly equal priority in receiving accommodation as someone who’s paralyzed from the neck down. The whole social culture of disability activism and studies is leveraged to support the individual’s demand for attention and proper respect; it cannot countenance the notion that there are those who we should put before ourselves. And the obvious impulse to say that someone who faces total debilitation from their disorder should, in fact, be a higher priority for the medical and therapeutic communities is treated as the height of bigotry.

In theory this general ideology may be an example of what I mean, as it embodies a certain fun social component, but with an element of glamour to ensure standards don't deteriorate.

I think implementing such a societal ""thought paradigm"" would require improved AGS activity, but then of course that's already in the works.

More around the clock security, but of course with the reformed licencing laws, punters are staying out all night now anyway.

Additionally, as anti-social behavior is in many respects, bitches looking for attention (i.e. the non-progressive side to society looking for attention/validation in the face of the progressive side), **introduction or elevation in standard of a societal trade that facilitates learning of how to adequately manage that behaviour**

i.e. how to f\*\*k bitches.

Just like people in my city are getting priced out of their preferred neighborhoods pushing them to buy in adjacent lower income neighborhoods. 

All of this said I feel it is inevitable that this is going to happen to West Virginia.

I'm writing a story set in a fantasy world in which technology, science and philosophy is similar to Renaissance Italy. Magic competes with technology. My main characters need to gain political support from the city council, dominated by 2 or 3 ""historical"" factions and a rising corporation. This support is needed to officially investigate against an ally that may be ready to betray them, stipulating a treaty with a common enemy to invade and conquer this rich city and its possessions. People in the city council have their own reasons to want to shut down the investigation not to bother their commerce, or to want a war with the former ally to boost their power. 

About the rising corporation, at first i thought about the wool merchants (Medici in Florence were part of the wool corporation), but i still can change it. It can be whatever speculative bubble that works in my story.

So, i would like to describe the ""wool corporation neighborhood"" as an area inhabited by new riches who kick working class out. How can I describe it?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/sdii06/land_and_lawsuits_anzaroots_botched_bet_on/,Land and Lawsuits - Anzaroot's Botched Bet on Baseball - The gentrification of Henry St.,"Don’t read too far into the title. Trying to have a little fun. Incoming lower effort post. 

Here are a few things I observed that tie into previous conversations about housing, gentrification, and slumlords that I consider interesting.

Isaac Anzaroot (MEJA Group LLC) recently purchased 6 properties from Faisal Afify (Pharaoh Group LLC) in August 2021. In previous observations, Anzaroot has purchased a number of properties from Afify over the last few years. 3 of these properties from the latest purchase are located on Henry St., accounting for 83 units. All of these units are currently empty. 

The Henry St properties are already being auctioned off beginning January 31st. The auction listing is titled [University/Stadium District Housing](https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/University-Stadium-District-Housing/22723425/). I interpret this as the beginning phase in the gentrification of the Henry St. & Pine St. neighborhoods. I think that is a common concern from residents in that neighborhood ever since the City announced plans for the [Stadium District Master Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8c6OYSJoBOmaDPqe-tjmRsqZWVrOecY/view?usp=sharing). It’s interesting to see the initial benefactors of such proposals. Additionally, witnessing the early movements is concerning/interesting!

It gets slightly more interesting when we see that Anzaroot filed a lawsuit on 11/5/21 against Afify for $3,000,000 in damages.

>“The nature of this action is Breach of Contract, Fraud, Tortious Interference, Slander, Deceptive Business Practices, Compel the Determination of a Claim to Real Property, and for Specific Performance.

So, someone got burned, or is claiming to have been burned. Other than that I have no idea what is going on there.
