You could even find a burger king and taco bell down the road in BU. Now we dont have anything. There is barely anyone yelling at me or asking for money. There is only one abandoned building in the area.  This is so disappointing and how a city loses character.","['Disappointed', 'by', 'the']","['kenmore', 'square.']",anurodhp,2021-12-08 22:40:59

https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/rchbln/activists_decry_gentrification_of_seaport/,Activists decry gentrification of seaport,"BOSTON — amidst a dusting of light snow, parking lot and warehouse enthusiasts have gathered in the seaport to protest the gentrification of the neighborhood.

Karen, a vegan from Somerville is appalled by the  environmental damage. “There was a whole habitat of plants and animals living in the old parking lots” she said, “and now it’s gone”.

Others were here for different reasons. “This is matter of equity”, says Kim, an activist from the south end.  Asked to elaborate she emphasized the loss of parking lots raised equity issues. 

Jim, unemployed from Wellesley spoke about the warehouses. “There was a whole community that gathered here. People see dilapidated buildings but it was more than that”. A child of the 80s, he continued “the condo developers can’t be stopped with a montage. This is real life”.

Among these protesters an unlikely ally. Luis a father of four and construction worker from Revere. “I just went to get coffee” he says, “can I go back to work?” , highlighting the displacement felt by the POC community.","['Activists', 'decry']",['seaport'],anurodhp,2021-12-09 18:38:26
