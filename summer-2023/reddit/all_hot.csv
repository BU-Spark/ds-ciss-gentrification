All in all, im pretty disappointed because CR is advertised extensively and has the image of being this amazing utopia. I came here to immerse myself with my broken Spanish and love for Central American food and people.

All I found here is a bunch of foreigners, let’s just say light skinned eh? Who have pura vida tattoos and a drinking problem on the coastal areas and adrenaline junkies on the other parts. 

The Ticos don’t seem to happy with the likes of these, and I get it, I wouldn’t be either considering again, that im Indian and I know what it feels like when a bunch of white people come to my country and make everything expensive and inaccessible to locals at the same time being patronizing. 

The gentrification here is driving me nuts and I don’t know how the Ticos deal. Then I see posts about some more Gringos wanting to move here for good and putting the housing market through the grater for locals just as it’s ruined in their “first world” economies.

I guess this is just a rant, just to say, beautiful country, filled with great locals, hope you get to retain your country and culture, hope you can afford to live comfortably. And before everyone goes “oh Costa Ricans are also immigrants from way back bla bla bla” shut up. Ok thanks.

I was hoping to go to mobile clown fair in Watertown but the A trolley never came when I waited for it at the Cadillac dealership on commonwealth avenue all I saw was the B. Any ideas where someone can get a bespoke clown costume in short notice?

Anyone remember the clown district? Gentrification is really destroying the character of the city. Such great stores; Shoes and things, Clown center, bradlees. At the end of the day shopping  you and the family  could pick up a raspberry muffin that would put Jordan marsh to shame.","['Feeling', 'the']","['the', 'clown', 'district', 'today…']",anurodhp,2023-06-05 03:18:55
