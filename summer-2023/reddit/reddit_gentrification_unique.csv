I know it's kinda frowned upon to self-promote on reddit, and I really haven't before but I've poured the last 5 years of my heart, passion, and creativity into this album and while the press hasn't really come through for us on this release, I'm confident that y'all beautiful people can help us get some streams.

For those new to our sound, we've been compared to the likes of Turkuaz and Thumpasaurus and have been described as Zappa meets OutKast. The new album is campy horror allegory with Lovecraftian imagery and ferocious rap-rock tones. If you want to dip your toe in I'd suggest the tracks: Multi-Dimensional Space Kraken, Spooky Food, Gentrification of Planet Earth, or Abortable Housing.

Thanks for listening and if you're in Austin we're playing our release/farewell show at Parish tonight at 8pm.

Best,

Our broad approach was to increase the per capita public space by creating more parks and green buffers considering that the entire city lacks the minimum requirement of 9 sq.m. 

However I read this paper which says that there are cases where by integrating more green spaces in localised areas, the market price of the area increases which polarizes the affordability and therefore displaces communities. I'd like to gain more perspective on it.","['to', 'the', 'displacement', 'or']",['communities?'],gentrification of communities?

Nobody but the (mostly flemish) upper class is benefiting from this while the rest of us are just trying to survive and pay our rent. 

The true Gentenaars don’t need a yoga studio or a expensive coffeeshop or a ultraliberal bookshop… especially not in the historically working class neighbourhoods that i’ve mentioned above. 

It’s also highly unfair for the working class people because we barely can afford living in Gent but the hipsters and gentrifiers can settle down anywhere from Sint Pieters to Muide… and the city is doing NOTHING to counter this inequality. While in other cities like Brussels and Antwerp many working class and POC people live in the centre, here in Gent we are mostly forced to live on the outer ring.","['Opinions/complaints', 'on']",['Gent'],gentrification of Gent

Karen, a vegan from Somerville is appalled by the  environmental damage. “There was a whole habitat of plants and animals living in the old parking lots” she said, “and now it’s gone”.

Others were here for different reasons. “This is matter of equity”, says Kim, an activist from the south end.  Asked to elaborate she emphasized the loss of parking lots raised equity issues. 

Jim, unemployed from Wellesley spoke about the warehouses. “There was a whole community that gathered here. People see dilapidated buildings but it was more than that”. A child of the 80s, he continued “the condo developers can’t be stopped with a montage. This is real life”.

Among these protesters an unlikely ally. Luis a father of four and construction worker from Revere. “I just went to get coffee” he says, “can I go back to work?” , highlighting the displacement felt by the POC community.","['Activists', 'decry']",['seaport'],gentrification of seaport
