# Project Background

The purpose of this project is to understand the various uses of the keyword “gentrification” in contexts different from its original definition:

“the process whereby the character of a poor urban area is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses, typically displacing current inhabitants in the process.” -Oxford Dictionary

We attempt to uncover new and uncommon uses of gentrification by searching through various newspaper databases using python tools and packages for natural language processing.


## Technologies and Tools

* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks
* ProQuest
* Twitter
* Natural Language Processing

# ProQuest Workflow

ProQuest is a database repository with many individual databases for different publications, sources, and other data types.

## Databases

Below is a list of the names of the databases we used:
* Boston Global Source
* Chicago Tribune Source
* The Washington Post Source
* The Wall Street Journal Source
* New York Times Source
* Los Angeles Times Source

Each database was created by searching for the keyword “gentrification of” to narrow the document count to only relevant articles.


## Scripts and Tools

The ProQuest database provided the main Python scripts used to search for keywords in context, create data frames, and narrow down the list of relevant keywords associated with “gentrification of…”.

## Future Work

Below is a list of possible work to be done on the data:
* Keyword analysis
* Word maps
* Article location analysis
* Sentiment analysis
